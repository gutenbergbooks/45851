<p>
This Edition is an exact reprint of the First Edition, with the addition
 of two important Essays on the Ethics and Politics of Aristotle, which
were found among the author’s posthumous papers. They were originally
published in 1876, in ‘Fragments on Ethical Subjects, by the late George
 Grote,’ but would have been included in the First Edition of this Work,
 had they been discovered in time. These Essays are the fruit of long
and laborious study, and, so far as they extend, embody the writer’s
matured views upon the Ethics and the Politics: the two treatises whose
omission from his published exposition of the Aristotelian philosophy
has been most regretted. </p><p>
The Essay on ‘The Ethics of Aristotle’ falls naturally into two
divisions; the first treats of Happiness; the second of what, according
to Aristotle, is the chief ingredient of Happiness, namely. Virtue. On
Aristotle’s own conception of Happiness, Mr. Grote dwells very minutely;
 turning it over on all sides, and looking at it from every point of
view. While fully acknowledging its merits, he gives also the full
measure of its defects. His criticisms on this head are in the author’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>iv</span>best style and are no less important as regards Ethical discussion than as a commentary on Aristotle. </p><p>
His handling of Aristotle’s doctrine of Virtue is equally subtle and instructive. Particularly striking are the remarks on the <i>Voluntary</i> and the <i>Involuntary</i>, and on &#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, or <i>deliberate preference</i>.</p><p>
The treatment of the Virtues in detail is, unhappily, more fragmentary;
but what he does say regarding Justice and Equity has a permanent
interest. </p><p>
The Essay on ‘The Politics of Aristotle’ must be studied in connection
with the preceding. Although but a brief sketch, it is remarkable for
the insight which it affords us into the most consummate political ideal
 of the ancient world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PREFACE BY THE EDITORS </h2><h2>
<span class="smcap">TO THE FIRST EDITION.</span> </h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
The Historian of Greece, when closing his great narrative in the year
1856, promised to follow out in a separate work that speculative
movement of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> which
upheld the supremacy of the Hellenic intellect long after the decline of
 Hellenic liberty. He had traced the beginnings of the movement in the
famous chapter on Sokrates, but to do justice to its chief heroes —
Plato and Aristotle — proved to be impossible within the limits of the
History. When, however, the promised work appeared, after nine laborious
 years, it was found to compass only Plato and the other immediate
companions of Sokrates, leaving a full half of the appointed task
unperformed. Mr. Grote had already passed his 70th year, but saw in this
 only a reason for turning, without a moment’s pause, to the arduous
labour still before him. Thenceforth, in spite of failing strength and
the increasing distraction of public business, he held steadily on till
death overtook him in the middle of the course. What he was able to
accomplish, though not what study he had gone through towards the
remainder of his design, these volumes will show. The office of
preparing and superintending their publication was entrusted to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>vi</span>present
 editors by Mrs. Grote, in the exercise of her discretion as sole
executrix under his last Will. As now printed, the work has its form
determined by the author himself up to the end of Chapter XI. The first
two chapters, containing a biography of Aristotle and a general account
of his works, are followed by a critical analysis, in eight chapters, of
 all the treatises included under the title ‘Organon;’ and in the
remaining chapter of the eleven the handling of the Physica and
Metaphysica (taken together for the reasons given) is begun. What now
stand as Chapters III., IV., &amp;c., were marked, however, as Chapters
VI., VII., &amp;c., by the author; his design evidently being to
interpolate before publication three other chapters of an introductory
cast. Unfortunately no positive indication remains as to the subject of
these; although there is reason to believe that, for one thing, he
intended to prefix to the detailed consideration of the works a key to
Aristotle’s perplexing terminology. Possibly also he designed to enter
upon a more particular discussion of the Canon, after having viewed it
externally in Chapter II.; citations and references bearing on such a
discussion being found among his loose notes.</p><p>
What might have been the course of the work from the point where it is
broken off, is altogether matter of inference, beyond an indication of
the subject of the chapter next to follow; but the remarks at the
beginning of Chapter III. point to some likely conclusions. After the
metaphysical discussions, which must have been prolonged through several
 chapters, there would probably have been taken in order the treatises
De Cœlo, De <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a>vii</span>Generatione
 et Corruptione, the Meteorologica, and next the various Biological
works; though with what detail in each case it is impossible to guess.
Then must have followed the De Animâ with the minor Psychological
treatises summed up as Parva Naturalia, and next, without doubt, the
Ethica and Politica; last of all, the Rhetorica and Poetica. That Mr.
Grote had carefully mastered all these works is evident from his
marginal annotations in the various copies which he read. With the
Ethica and Politica in particular he had early been familiar, and most
there is reason to regret that he has left nothing worked out upon this
field so specially his own.<a name="FnAnchor_Pref_1" href="#Footnote_Pref_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Fortunately it happens that on the psychological field next adjoining there is something considerable to show.</p><p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote_Pref_1" id="Footnote_Pref_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor_Pref_1">1</a></span>
 It has been already stated that two important Essays on these subjects
have been discovered among Mr. Grote’s posthumous papers since the
publication of the First Edition. They are printed in this Edition after
 the chapter De Animâ. — <span class="smcap">Second Edition</span>.</p></div><p>
In the autumn of 1867 Mr. Grote undertook to write a short account of
Aristotle’s striking recognition of the physical aspect of mental
phenomena, to be appended to the third edition of the senior editor’s
work, ‘The Senses and the Intellect;’ but, on following out the
indications relative to that point, he was gradually led by his interest
 in the subject to elaborate a full abstract of the De Animâ and the
other psychological treatises. Several months were spent on this task,
and at the end he declared that it had greatly deepened his insight into
 Aristotle’s philosophy as a whole. He also expressed his satisfaction
at having thus completed an exposition of the Psychology, fitted to
stand as his contribution to that part of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>viii</span>Aristotle,
 in case he should never reach the subject in the regular course of his
general work. The exposition was printed in full at the time (1868), and
 drew the attention of students. It is now reprinted, with the
prominence due to its literary finish and intrinsic value, as a chapter —
 the last — in the body of the present work.</p><p> </p><p>The long
Appendix coming after is composed of elements somewhat heterogeneous;
but the different sections were all written in the period since 1865,
and all, not excepting the last two (treating briefly of Epikurus and
the Stoics), have a bearing upon the author’s general design. </p><p>
The first section — an historical account of ancient theories of Universals — has already seen the light.<a name="FnAnchor_Pref_2" href="#Footnote_Pref_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 It brings together, as nowhere else, all the chief references to the
doctrine of Realism in Plato, and exhibits the directly antagonistic
position taken up by Aristotle towards his master. This it does so
impressively that there could be no question of excluding it, even
although it reproduces in part some of the matter of Chapter III., on
the Categories. Being composed, in 1867, later than this Chapter, it is
on that account written with all the firmer a grasp. On finishing it as
it stands, Mr. Grote, in a private letter, expressed himself in terms
that deserve to be quoted: — “I never saw before so clearly the extreme
importance of Aristotle’s speculations as the guides and stimulants of
mediæval philosophy. If I had time to carry the account further, I
should have been able to show how much the improved views of the
question<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a>ix</span>
 of Universals depended on the fact that more and more of the works of
Aristotle, and better texts, became known to Albertus Magnus, Thomas
Aquinas, and their successors. During the centuries immediately
succeeding Boëthius, nothing of Aristotle except the Categories and the
treatise De Interpretatione was known, and these in a Latin translation.
 Most fortunately the Categories was never put out of sight; and it is
there that the doctrine of <i>Substantia Prima</i> stands clearly proclaimed.” </p><p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote_Pref_2" id="Footnote_Pref_2"></a><a href="#FnAnchor_Pref_2">2</a></span> In the Appendix to the senior editor’s ‘Manual of Mental and Moral Science’ (1867).</p></div><p>
The second section, or, rather, the part therein treating of Aristotle’s
 doctrine of First Principles, is also a reprint. It was composed (in
1867) at the same time as the section on Universals, and was printed
along with that; shorn, however, of the critical examination of Sir
William Hamilton’s views on Aristotle, which is now prefixed to the
statement of the Aristotelian doctrine. Hamilton having (in Note A,
appended to his edition of Reid’s Works) claimed Aristotle as a
supporter of the Philosophy of Common Sense, basing upon a long list of
passages quoted, these were subjected by Mr. Grote to a searching
criticism, the pointed vigour of which will be duly appreciated. The
statement of his own view of Aristotle’s doctrine, though containing
little that may not be found at more places than one in the body of the
present work, is yet reprinted, because iteration was his favourite art
for impressing anything to which he attached as much importance as he
did attach to this conviction of his, regarding the very heart of
Aristotle’s thought. </p><p>
The long abstracts of six books of the Metaphysica and two books of the De Cœlo, next following in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>x</span>Appendix,
 are sections of a character altogether different from the foregoing.
Evidently not intended for publication, they have been included, partly
as furnishing some indication of the labour the author underwent in
seeking to lay hold of his subject, partly because of their inherent
value. From the first motive, they are here reproduced as nearly as
possible in the guise they wore as preliminary drafts, bestrewed with
references. Their value consists in the fact that they give Mr. Grote’s
interpretation of the text of treatises at once exceedingly difficult
and important: difficult, as is proved by the great divergence, among
commentators at many points; important, not more for the deeper aspects
of Aristotle’s own system, than for the speculations of the earlier
Greek philosophers on which they are the classical authority. What
relation, in the case of each treatise, the books abstracted (often
translated) hold to the other books left untouched, is specially
indicated at the beginning of the third section and at the end of the
fourth. Here let it suffice to mention that each abstract has a certain
completeness in itself, and at the same time a bond of connection with
the other. The abstract of the Metaphysica closes where Aristotle
descends to speak of the concrete heavenly bodies, and just as much of
the De Cœlo is given as treats specially of these. This connection,
whether or not it was present to the author’s mind, enhances the value
of the abstracts as here presented.<a name="FnAnchor_Pref_3" href="#Footnote_Pref_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> </p><p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote_Pref_3" id="Footnote_Pref_3"></a><a href="#FnAnchor_Pref_3">3</a></span>
 The author carried the abstract of De Cœlo a little farther, and then
abruptly broke it off; probably finding himself borne too far away from
the logical treatises with which he was at the time dealing.</p></div><p>
In the remaining sections of the Appendix, not dealing <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>xi</span>with
 Aristotle, the short account of Epikurus aims at setting in its true
light a much-maligned system of thought. On writing it, in 1867, Mr.
Grote remarked that the last word had not yet been said on Epikurus. The
 ethical part of the sketch was printed at the time:<a name="FnAnchor_Pref_4" href="#Footnote_Pref_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
 the whole is now given. More fragmentary is the notice of the Stoics,
as merely replacing passages that he considered inadequate in a sketch
submitted to him. Since it formed part of his entire design to add to
the treatment of Aristotle a full exposition both of Stoic and Epikurean
 doctrines, considered as the outgrowth of the Cynic and Kyrenaic
theories already handled at the end of the ‘Plato,’ the two fragments
may not unfitly close the present work. </p><p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote_Pref_4" id="Footnote_Pref_4"></a><a href="#FnAnchor_Pref_4">4</a></span> Also in the ‘Manual of Mental and Moral Science,’ among ‘Ethical Systems.’</p></div><p>
Taken altogether, the two volumes are undoubtedly a most important
contribution to the history of ancient thought. As regards Aristotle,
the author’s design must be gathered chiefly from the first eleven
chapters, — begun as these were in 1865, and proceeded with in their
order, till he was overtaken, in the act of composing the last, by the
insidious malady which, after six months, finally carried him off.
Perhaps the most striking feature in the exposition of the Organon, is
the very full analysis given of the long treatise called Topica. While
the other treatises have all, more or less, been drawn upon for the
ordinary theory of Logic, the Topica, with its mixed logical and
rhetorical bearings, has ceased to be embodied in modern schemes of
discipline or study. Mr. Grote’s profound interest in everything
pertaining to Dialectic <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>xii</span>drew
 him especially to this work, as the exhibition in detail of that habit
of methodized discussion so deeply rooted in the Hellenic mind. And in
the same connection it may be noted how the natural course of his work
brought him, in the last months of his intellectual activity, to tread
again old and familiar ground. A plea — this time against Aristotle —
for the decried Sophists, and, once more, a picture of that <span class="correction" title="amended from 'dialetical'">dialectical</span> mission of Sokrates which for him had an imperishable charm, were among the very last efforts of his pen. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
Besides making up the Second Volume from the end of Chapter XI., the
editors have, throughout the whole work, bestowed much attention on the
notes and references set down by the author with his usual copious
minuteness. It was deemed advisable to subject these everywhere to a
detailed verification; and, though the editors speak on the matter with a
 diffidence best understood by those who may have undergone a similar
labour, it is hoped that a result not unworthy of the author has been
attained. In different places additional references have been supplied,
either where there was an obvious omission on the author’s part, or in
farther confirmation of his views given in the text: such references,
mostly to the works of Aristotle himself, it has not been thought
necessary to signalize. Where, as once or twice in the Appendix, a
longer note in explanation seemed called for, this has been printed
within square brackets. </p><p>
From the text some passages, where the iterations seemed excessive, have
 been withheld, but only such as it was thought the author would himself
 have struck out <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a>xiii</span>upon
 revision: wherever there was evidence that revision had been made, the
iterations, freely employed for emphasis, have been allowed to stand. On
 rare occasions, interpolations and verbal changes have been made with
the view of bringing out more clearly the meaning sought to be conveyed.
 It is impossible to be more deeply sensible than the editors are, of
the responsibility they have thus incurred; but they have been guided by
 their very respect for the venerable author, and they were fortunate in
 the many opportunities they enjoyed of learning from his own lips the
cast of his views on Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchor_Pref_5" href="#Footnote_Pref_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p><p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote_Pref_5" id="Footnote_Pref_5"></a><a href="#FnAnchor_Pref_5">5</a></span>
 It is but due to the younger editor to state that the heaviest part of
all the work here indicated has been done by him. — A. B.</p></div><p>
An index has been drawn up with some care; as was needful, if meant to
be of real service to the readers of so elaborate a work. </p><p>
It only remains to add that in printing the Greek of the notes, &amp;c.,
 the text of Waitz has been followed for the Organon (everywhere short
of the beginning); the text of Bonitz, for the Metaphysica; and for
other works of Aristotle, generally the Berlin edition. Regard was had,
as far as the editors’ knowledge went, to the author’s own preferences
in his reading. </p><p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In my preceding work, ‘Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates,’ I
 described a band of philosophers differing much from each other, but
all emanating from Sokrates as common intellectual progenitor; all
manifesting themselves wholly or principally in the composition of
dialogues; and all living in an atmosphere of Hellenic freedom, as yet
untroubled by any over-ruling imperial ascendancy from without. From
that band, among whom Plato is <i>facilè princeps</i>, I now proceed to
another, among whom the like pre-eminence belongs to Aristotle. This
second band knew the Sokratic stimulus only as an historical tradition;
they gradually passed, first from the Sokratic or Platonic dialogue —
dramatic, colloquial, cross-examining — to the Aristotelian dialogue,
semi-dramatic, rhetorical, counter-expository; and next to formal
theorizing, ingenious solution and divination of special problems,
historical criticism and abundant collections of detailed facts:
moreover, they were witnesses of the extinction of freedom in Hellas,
and of the rise of the Macedonian kingdom out of comparative nullity to
the highest pinnacle of supremacy and mastership. Under the successors
of Alexander, this extraneous supremacy, intermeddling and dictatorial,
not only overruled the political movements of the Greeks, but also
influenced powerfully the position and working of their philosophers;
and would have become at once equally intermeddling even earlier, under
Alexander himself, had not his whole time and personal energy been
absorbed by insatiable thirst for eastern conquest, ending with an
untimely death.</p>
<p>
Aristotle was born at Stageira, an unimportant Hellenic colony in
Thrace, which has obtained a lasting name in history from the fact of
being his birthplace. It was situated in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>Strymonic
 Gulf, a little north of the isthmus which terminates in the mountainous
 promontory of Athos; its founders were Greeks from the island of
Andros, reinforced afterwards by additional immigrants from Chalkis in
Eubœa. It was, like other Grecian cities, autonomous — a distinct,
self-governing community; but it afterwards became incorporated in the
confederacy of free cities under the presidency of Olynthus. The most
material feature in its condition, at the period of Aristotle’s birth,
was, that it lay near the frontier of Macedonia, and not far even from
Pella, the residence of the Macedonian king Amyntas (father of Philip).
Aristotle was born, not earlier than 392 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, nor later than 385-384 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 His father, Nikomachus, was a citizen of Stageira, distinguished as a
physician, author of some medical works, and boasting of being descended
 from the heroic <i>gens</i> of the Asklepiads; his mother, Phaestis, was also of good civic family, descended from one of the first Chalkidian colonists.<a name="FnAnchor1_1" href="#Footnote1_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 Moreover, Nikomachus was not merely learned in his art, but was
accepted as confidential physician and friend of Amyntas, with whom he
passed much of his time — a circumstance of great moment to the future
career of his son. We are told that among the Asklepiads the habit of
physical observation, and even manual training in dissection, were
imparted traditionally from father to son, from the earliest years, thus
 serving as preparation for medical practice when there were no written
treatises to study.<a name="FnAnchor1_2" href="#Footnote1_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The mind of Aristotle may thus have acquired that appetite for physiological study which so many of his treatises indicate. </p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_1" id="Footnote1_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_1">1</a></span>
 Diog. L. v. 10. This was probably among the reasons which induced
Aristotle to prefer Chalkis as his place of temporary retirement, when
he left Athens after the death of Alexander.</p></div>

<p>
We here learn that in the heroic genealogy of the Asklepiads, the son of
 Machaon himself bore the name of Nikomachus. I do not think that Will.
v. Humboldt and Bernays are warranted in calling Aristotle “ein
Halbgrieche,” “kein vollbürtiger Hellene” — (Die Dialoge des
Aristoteles, pp. 2-56-134). An Hellenic family which migrated from
Athens, Chalkis, Corinth, etc., to establish a colony on the coast of
Thrace, or Asia Minor, did not necessarily lose its Hellenism. One
cannot designate Demokritus, Xenokrates, Anaxagoras, Empedokles,
&amp;c., half Greeks. </p>
<p>
Diogenes here especially cites Hermippus (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 220-210), from whom several of his statements in this and other
biographies appear to have been derived. The work of Hermippus seems to
have been entitled “Lives of the Philosophers” (v. 2), among which lives
 that of Aristotle was one. </p>
<p>
Hermippus mentioned, among other matters, communications made to
Aristotle by Strœbus (a person engaged in the service of Kallisthenes as
 reader) respecting the condemnation and execution of Kallisthenes in
Baktria, by order of Alexander (Plutarch, Alex. c. 54). From what source
 did Hermippus derive these statements made by Strœbus to Aristotle?</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>Respecting
the character of his youth, there existed, even in antiquity, different
accounts. We learn that he lost his father and mother while yet a youth,
 and that he came under the guardianship of Proxenus, a native of
Atarneus who had settled at Stageira. According to one account, adopted
apparently by the earliest witnesses preserved to us,<a name="FnAnchor1_3" href="#Footnote1_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
 he was at first an extravagant youth, spent much of his paternal
property, and then engaged himself to military service; of which he soon
 became weary, and went back to Stageira, turning to account the
surgical building, apparatus, and medicines left by his father as a
medical practitioner. After some time, we know not how long, he retired
from this profession, shut up the building, and devoted himself to
rhetoric and philosophy. He then went to Athens, and there entered
himself in the school of Plato, at the age of thirty.<a name="FnAnchor1_4" href="#Footnote1_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The philosophical life was thus (if this account be believed) a second choice, adopted comparatively late in life.<a name="FnAnchor1_5" href="#Footnote1_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The other account, depending also upon good <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>witnesses,
 represents him as having come to Athens and enlisted as pupil of Plato,
 at the early age of seventeen or eighteen: it omits all mention of an
antecedent period, occupied by military service and a tentative of
medical profession.<a name="FnAnchor1_6" href="#Footnote1_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 In both the two narratives, Aristotle appears as resident at Athens,
and devoting himself to rhetoric and philosophy, from some period before
 360 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> down to the death of Plato in 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>;
 though, according to the first of the two narratives, he begins his
philosophical career at a later age, while his whole life occupied
seventy years instead of sixty-two years. </p>

 An author named Eumêlus (cited by Diogenes, v. 6, &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#941;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#8131; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#8182;&#957;, but not otherwise known) stated that Aristotle came to Plato
at the age of thirty, and that he lived altogether to seventy years of
age, instead of sixty-three, as Hermippus and Apollodorus affirmed.
Eumêlus conceived Aristotle as born in 392 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and coming to Plato in 362 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 His chronological data are in harmony with the statements of Epikurus
and Timæus respecting the early life of Aristotle. The &#914;&#943;&#959;&#962; &#7944;&#957;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#962;
given by Ménage recognizes two distinct accounts as to the age at which
Aristotle died: one assigning to him 70 years, the other only 63.</p></div>

 See the Fragments of Timæus in Didot, Fragmenta Historicorum Græcorum,
Fr. 70-74; also Aristokles, ap. Eusebium, Præp. Evang. xv. 2; Diogenes,
L. x. 8; Athenæus, viii. p. 354. Timæus called Aristotle <span class="gesp">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8000;&#968;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#8134;</span>
 &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#953;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#943;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;. The
speaker in Athenæus designates him as &#8001; &#966;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#974;&#955;&#951;&#962;. The terms used by
these writers are illtempered and unbecoming in regard to so great a man
 as Aristotle; but this is irrelevant to the question, whether they do
not describe, in perverted colouring, some real features in his earlier
life, or whether there was not, at least, a chronological basis of
possibility for them. That no such features were noticed by other
enemies of Aristotle, such as Eubulides and Kephisodôrus, is a reason as
 far as it goes for not believing them to be real, yet not at all a
conclusive reason; nor is the speaker in Athenæus exact when he says
that Epikurus is the <i>only</i> witness, for we find Timæus making the
same statements. The &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; (see Antiphanes, apud Polluc. iv. 183 —
Fragmenta Comic. cxxv., Meineke) of a Greek physician (more properly we
should call the &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; <i>a general practitioner and chemist</i>) was
the repository of his materials and the scene of his important
operations; for many of which instructions are given in the curious
Hippokratic treatise entitled &#922;&#945;&#964;’ &#7992;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, vol. iii. pp. 262-337 of
the edition of M. Littré, who in his preface to the treatise, p. 265,
remarks about Aristotle:— “Il paraît qu’Aristote, qui était de famille
médicale, avoit renoncé à une officine de ce genre, d’une grande
valeur.” Stahr speaks of this &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; as if Aristotle had set up one <i>at Athens</i>
 (Aristotelia, p. 38), which the authorities do not assert; it was
probably at Stageira. Ideler (Comm. <span class="correction" title="amended from 'ad.'">ad</span> Aristot. Meteorol. iv. 3, 16, p.
 433) considers this story about Aristotle’s &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; to have been a
fiction arising out of various expressions in his writings about the
preparation of drugs — &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#940;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#945; &#7957;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &amp;c. I think this is
far-fetched. And when we find Aristokles rejecting the allegation about
the &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, by speaking of it as an &#7940;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#957;  &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, we can admit
neither the justice of the epithet nor the ground of rejection.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_6" id="Footnote1_6"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_6">6</a></span> This account rested originally (so far as we know) upon the statement of Hermippus (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 220), and was adopted by Apollodôrus in his Chronology (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 150), both of them good authorities, yet neither of them so early as
Epikurus and Timæus. Diogenes Laertius and Dionysius of Halikarnassus
alike follow Hermippus. Both the life of Aristotle ascribed to Ammonius,
 and the Anonymous Life first edited by Robbe (Leyden, 1861, p. 2),
include the same strange chronological blunder: they affirm Aristotle to
 have come to Athens at the age of seventeen, and to have frequented the
 society of <i>Sokrates</i> (who had been dead more than thirty years)
for three years; then to have gone to Plato at the age of twenty. Zeller
 imagines, and I think it likely, that Aristotle may have been for a
short time pupil with <i>Isokrates</i>, and that the story of his having been pupil with <i>Sokrates</i>
 has arisen from confusion of the two names, which confusion has been
seen on several occasions (Zeller, Gesch. der Philos. der Griechen, ii.
2, p. 15.)</p></div>
<p>
During the interval, 367-360 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Plato was
much absent from Athens, having paid two separate visits to Dionysius
the younger at Syracuse. The time which he spent there at each visit is
not explicitly given; but as far as we can conjecture from indirect
allusions, it cannot have been less than a year at each, and may
possibly have been longer. If, therefore, Aristotle reached Athens in
367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (as Hermippus represents) he cannot have enjoyed continuous instructions from Plato for the three or four years next ensuing. </p>
<p>
However the facts may stand as to Aristotle’s early life, there is no doubt that in or before the year 362 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 he became resident at Athens, and that he remained there, profiting by
the society and lectures of Plato, until the death of the latter in 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 Shortly after the loss of his master, he quitted Athens, along with his
 fellow-pupil Xenokrates, and went to Atarneus, which was at that time
ruled by the despot Hermeias. That despot was a remarkable man, who
being a eunuch through bodily hurt when a child, and having become slave
 of a prior despot named Eubulus, had contrived to succeed him in the
supreme power, and governed the towns of Atarneus and Assos with
firmness and energy. Hermeias had been at Athens, had heard Plato’s
lectures, and had contracted friendship with Aristotle; which friendship
 became farther cemented by the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span> of Aristotle, during his residence at Atarneus, with Pythias the niece of Hermeias.<a name="FnAnchor1_7" href="#Footnote1_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 For three years Aristotle and Xenokrates remained at Assos or Atarneus,
 whence they were then forced to escape by reason of the despot’s death;
 for Mentor the Rhodian, general of the Persians in those regions,
decoyed Hermeias out of the town under pretence of a diplomatic
negociation, then perfidiously seized him, and sent him up as prisoner
to the Persian king, by whose order he was hanged. Mentor at the same
time seized the two towns and other possessions of Hermeias,<a name="FnAnchor1_8" href="#Footnote1_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
 while Aristotle with his wife retired to Mitylene. His deep grief for
the fate of Hermeias was testified in a noble hymn or pæan which he
composed, and which still remains, as well as by an epigram inscribed on
 the statue of Hermeias at Delphi. We do not hear of his going
elsewhere, until, two or three years afterwards (the exact date is
differently reported), he was invited by Philip into Macedonia, to
become preceptor to the young prince Alexander, then thirteen or
fourteen years old. The reputation, which Aristotle himself had by this
time established, doubtless coincided with the recollection of his
father Nikomachus as physician and friend of Amyntas, in determining
Philip to such a choice. Aristotle performed the duties required from
him,<a name="FnAnchor1_9" href="#Footnote1_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 enjoying the confidence and favour both of Philip and Alexander, until
the assassination of the former and the accession of the latter in 336 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> His principle residence during this period was in Macedonia, but he paid occasional visits to Athens, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>and
 allusion is made to certain diplomatic services which he rendered to
the Athenians at the court of Philip; moreover he must have spent some
time at his native city Stageira,<a name="FnAnchor1_10" href="#Footnote1_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> which had been among the many Greek cities captured and ruined by Philip during the Olynthian war of 349-347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 Having obtained the consent and authority of Philip, Aristotle repaired
 to Stageira for the purpose of directing the re-establishment of the
city. Recalling such of its dispersed inhabitants as could be collected,
 either out of the neighbouring villages or from more distant parts, he
is said to have drawn up laws, or framed regulations for the returned
citizens, and new comers. He had reason to complain of various rivals
who intrigued against him, gave him much trouble, and obstructed the
complete renovation of the city; but, notwithstanding, his services were
 such that an annual festival was instituted to commemorate them.<a name="FnAnchor1_11" href="#Footnote1_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 It is farther stated, that at some time during this period he had a
school (analogous to the Academy at Athens) in the Nymphæum of the place
 called Mieza; where stone seats and shady walks, ennobled by the name
of Aristotle, were still shown even in the days of Plutarch.<a name="FnAnchor1_12" href="#Footnote1_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

 Strabo, xiii. 610; Diodor. xvi. 52. It appears that Aristotle incurred
censure, even from contemporary rivals, for this marriage with Pythias.
On what ground we cannot exactly make out (Aristokles ap. Eusebium Præp.
 Ev. xv. 2), unless it be from her relationship to Hermeias. She died
long before Aristotle, but he mentions her in his will in terms
attesting the constant affection which had reigned between them until
her death. Aristotle thought it right to reply to the censure in one of
his letters to Antipater.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aristokles (ap. Euseb. Præp. Ev. xv. 2) says that Aristotle did not
marry Pythias until after the death of Hermeias, when she was compelled
to save herself by flight, and was in distress and poverty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. Blakesley (Life of Aristotle, p. 36) and Oncken (Die Staatslehre
des Aristoteles, p. 158) concur in thinking that the departure of
Aristotle from Athens had nothing to do with the death of Plato, but was
 determined by the capture of Olynthus, and by the fear and dislike of
Philip which that event engendered at Athens. </p>
<p>
But the fact that Xenokrates left Athens along with Aristotle disproves
this supposition, and proves that the death of Plato was the real cause.</p></div>

 Diog. Laert. v. 7-8. Diodorus ascribes this proceeding to Mentor the
Rhodian: Strabo, to his brother Memnon. I think Diodorus is right. A
remarkable passage in the Magna Moralia (genuine or spurious) of
Aristotle, seems to me to identify the proceeding with Mentor (Aristot.
Magn. Mor. i. 35, p. 1197, b. 21; as also the spurious second book of
the Œkonomica, p. 1351, a. 33).</p></div>

 It was probably during this period that Aristotle introduced to
Alexander his friend the rhetor Theodektês of Phasêlis. Alexander took
delight in the society of Theodektês, and testified this feeling, when
he conquered Phasêlis, by demonstrations of affection and respect
towards the statue of the rhetor, who had died during the intervening
years — &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#956;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8131; &#948;&#953;’ &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#957;

 It is to this period of Aristotle’s life that the passage extracted
from his letters in Demetrius (so-called &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7961;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;) refers. &#8033;&#962;

<p>
We shall hardly consider this double employment of the epithet <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#956;&#947;&#941;&#945;&#957;'">&#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;&#957;</span>
 as an instance of that success in epistolary style, which Demetrius
ascribes to Aristotle (s. 239); but the passage proves Aristotle’s
visits both to Stageira and to Athens. The very cold winters of the
Chalkidic peninsula were severely felt by the Greeks (Plato — Symposion,
 p. 220), and may well have served as motive to Aristotle for going from
 Stageira to Athens.</p></div>

Respecting the allusions made in these statements to various persons who
 were reluctant to return out of the separate villages into the restored

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_12" id="Footnote1_12"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_12">12</a></span> Plutarch, Alexander, c. 7. What Plutarch calls the <i>Nymphæum</i>, is considered by Stahr (Aristotelia, i. p. 93 n.) to be probably the same as what Pliny denominates the <i>Museum</i>
 at Stageira (N. H. xvi. c. 23); but Zeller (p. 23, n.), after Geier,
holds that Mieza lay S.W. of Pella, in Emathia, far from Stageira.
Plutarch seems to imply that Aristotle was established along with
Alexander at Meiza by Philip.</p>
<p>
Compare, for these facts of the biography of Aristotle, Stahr, Aristotelia, Part I., pp. 86-94, 103-106.</p>
<p>
I conceive that it was during this residence in Macedonia and at Pella,
that Aristotle erected the cenotaph in honour of Hermeias, which is so
contemptuously derided by the Chian poet Theokritus in his epigram,
Diog. L. v. 11. The epigram is very severe on Aristotle, for preferring
Pella to the Academy as a residence; ascribing such preference to the
exigencies of an ungovernable stomach.</p></div>
<p>
In 336 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Alexander became king of
Macedonia, and his vast projects for conquest, first of Persia, next of
other peoples known and unknown, left him no leisure for anything but
military and imperial occupations. It was in the ensuing year (335 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> when the preparations for the Persian expedition were being <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>completed,
 ready for its execution in the following spring, that Aristotle
transferred his residence to Athens. The Platonic philosophical school
in which he had studied was now conducted by Xenokrates as Scholarch,
having passed at the death of Plato, in 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, to his nephew Speusippus, and from the latter to Xenokrates in 339 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 Aristotle established for himself a new and rival school on the eastern
 side of Athens, in the gymnasium attached to the temple of Apollo
Lykeius, and deriving from thence the name by which it was commonly
known — the Lykeium. In that school, and in the garden adjoining, he
continued to lecture or teach, during the succeeding twelve years,
comprising the life and the brilliant conquests of Alexander. Much of
his instruction is said to have been given while walking in the garden,
from whence the students and the sect derived the title of Peripatetics.
 In the business of his school and the composition of his works all his
time was occupied; and his scholars soon became so numerous that he
found it convenient to desire them to elect from themselves every ten
days a rector to maintain order, as Xenokrates had already done at the
Academy.<a name="FnAnchor1_13" href="#Footnote1_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
 Aristotle farther maintained correspondence, not merely with Alexander
and Antipater but also with Themison, one of the princes of Cyprus, as
Isokrates had corresponded with Nikokles, and Plato with Dionysius of
Syracuse.<a name="FnAnchor1_14" href="#Footnote1_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> </p>

 Diog. L. v. 4. Brandis notes it as a feature in Aristotle’s character
(p. 65), that he abstained from meddling with public affairs at Athens.
But we must remember, that, not being a citizen of Athens, Aristotle was
 not competent to meddle personally. His great and respected
philosophical competitor, Xenokrates (a non-citizen or metic as well as
he), was so far from being in a condition to meddle with public affairs,
 that he was once even arrested for not having paid in due season his
&#956;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;, or capitation-tax imposed upon metics. He was liberated,
according to one story, by Lykurgus (Plutarch, Vit. x. Oratt. p. 842);
according to another story (seemingly more probable), by Demetrius
Phalereus (Diog. La. iv. 14). The anonymous life of Aristotle published
by Robbe (Leyden, 1861, p. 3), takes due notice of Aristotle’s position
at Athens as a metic.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_14" id="Footnote1_14"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_14">14</a></span>
 Aristotle addressed to Themison a composition now lost, but well known
in antiquity, called &#928;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;. It was probably a dialogue; and was
intended as an encouragement to the study of philosophy. See Rose,
Aristot. Pseud. pp. 69-72, who gives a very interesting fragment of it
out of Stobæus.</p>
<p>
We have the titles of two lost works of Aristotle — &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;, and
&#7944;&#955;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;, &#7970; &#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#969;&#957; (or &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#953;&#8182;&#957;). Both seem to have been
dialogues. In one, or in both, he gave advice to Alexander respecting
the manner of ruling his newly acquired empire in Asia; and respecting
the relations proper to be established between Hellenes and native
Asiatics (see Rose, Arist. Pseud. pp. 92-96; Bernays, Die Dialoge des
Aristot. pp. 51-57).</p></div>
<p>
In June, 323 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, occurred the premature and
 unexpected decease of the great Macedonian conqueror, aged 32 years and
 8 months, by a violent fever at Babylon. So vast was his power, and so
unmeasured his ambition, that the sudden removal of such a man operated
as a shock to the hopes and fears of almost <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>every one, both in Greece and Asia. It produced an entire change in the position of Aristotle at Athens.</p>
<p>
To understand what that position really was, we must look at it in
connection with his Macedonian sympathies, and with the contemporaneous
political sentiment at Athens. It was in the middle of the year 335 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 that Alexander put down by force the revolt of the Thebans, took their
city by assault, demolished it altogether (leaving nothing but the
citadel called Kadmeia, occupied by a Macedonian garrison), and divided
its territory between two other Bœotian towns. Immediately after that
terror-striking act, he demanded from the Athenians (who had sympathized
 warmly with Thebes, though without overt acts of assistance) the
surrender of their principal anti-Macedonian politicians. That demand
having been refused, he at first prepared to extort compliance at the
point of the sword, but was persuaded, not without difficulty, to
renounce such intention, and to be content with the voluntary exile of
Ephialtes and Charidemus from Athens. Though the unanimous vote of the
Grecian Synod at Corinth constituted him Imperator, there can be no
doubt that the prevalent sentiment in Greece towards him was that of
fear and dislike; especially among the Athenians, whose dignity was most
 deeply mortified, and to whom the restriction of free speech was the
most painful.<a name="FnAnchor1_15" href="#Footnote1_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_15" id="Footnote1_15"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_15">15</a></span> See History of Greece, chap. xci. pp. 18, 41, 64.</p></div>
<p>
Now it was just at this moment (in 335 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
that Aristotle came to Athens and opened his school. We cannot doubt
that he was already known and esteemed as the author of various
published writings. But the prominent mark by which every one now
distinguished him, was, that he had been for several years confidential
preceptor of Alexander, and was still more or less consulted by that
prince, as well as sustained by the friendship of Antipater, viceroy of
Macedonia during the king’s absence. Aristotle was regarded as
philo-Macedonian, and to a certain extent, anti-Hellenic — the sentiment
 expressed towards him in the unfriendly epigram of the contemporary
Chian poet Theokritus.<a name="FnAnchor1_16" href="#Footnote1_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
 His new school, originally opened under the protection and patronage of
 Alexander and Antipater, continued to be associated with their names,
by that large proportion of Athenian citizens who held anti-Macedonian
sentiments. Alexander caused <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>the statue of Aristotle to be erected in Athens,<a name="FnAnchor1_17" href="#Footnote1_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 and sent to him continual presents of money, usefully employed by the
philosopher in the prosecution of his physical and zoological
researches,<a name="FnAnchor1_18" href="#Footnote1_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
 as well as in the purchase of books. Moreover, Aristotle remained in
constant and friendly correspondence with Antipater, the resident
viceroy at Pella,<a name="FnAnchor1_19" href="#Footnote1_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 during the absence of Alexander in Asia. Letters of recommendation from
 Aristotle to the Macedonian rulers were often given and found useful:
several of them were preserved and published afterwards. There is even
reason to believe that the son of Antipater — Kassander, afterwards
viceroy or king of Macedonia, was among his pupils.<a name="FnAnchor1_20" href="#Footnote1_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

 We may infer this fact from the insulting reply made by Alexander, not
long before his death, to Kassander, who had just then joined him for
the first time at Babylon, having been sent by Antipater at the head of a
 reinforcement. Some recent comers from Greece complained to Alexander
of having been ill-used by Antipater. Kassander being present at the
complaint, endeavoured to justify his father and to invalidate their
testimony, upon which Alexander silenced him by the remark that he was
giving a specimen of sophistical duplicity learnt from Aristotle. &#932;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;
&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;, &#959;&#7984;&#956;&#969;&#958;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957;,

<p>
I have recounted elsewhere how the character of Alexander became
gradually corrupted by unexampled success and Asiatic influences;<a name="FnAnchor1_21" href="#Footnote1_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 how he thus came to feel less affection and esteem for Aristotle, to
whom he well knew that his newly acquired imperial and semi-divine
pretensions were not likely to be acceptable; how, on occasion of the
cruel sentence passed on Kallisthenes, he threatened even to punish
Aristotle himself, as having recommended Kallisthenes, and as
sympathizing with the same free spirit; lastly, how Alexander became
more or less alienated, not only from the society of Hellenic citizens,
but even from his faithful viceroy, the Macedonian Antipater. But these
changed relations between Aristotle and Alexander did not come before
the notice of the Athenians, nor alter the point of view in which they
regarded the philosopher; the rather, since the relations of Aristotle
with Antipater continued as intimate as ever.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_21" id="Footnote1_21"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_21">21</a></span> Histor. of Greece, ch. xciv. pp. 291, 301, 341; Plutarch, Alexand. c. lv.; Dion Chrysostom. Orat. 64, p. 338, Reiske.</p></div>
<p>
It will thus appear, that though all the preserved writings of Aristotle
 are imbued with a thoroughly independent spirit of theorizing
contemplation and lettered industry, uncorrupted by any servility or
political bias — yet his position during the twelve <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span> years between 335-323 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 inevitably presented him to the Athenians as the macedonizing
philosopher, parallel with Phokion as the macedonizing politician, and
in pointed antithesis to Xenokrates at the Academy, who was attached to
the democratical constitution, and refused kingly presents. Besides that
 enmity which he was sure to incur, as an acute and self-thinking
philosopher, from theology and the other anti-philosophical veins in the
 minds of ordinary men, Aristotle thus became the object of unfriendly
sentiment from many Athenian patriots,<a name="FnAnchor1_22" href="#Footnote1_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
 who considered the school of Plato generally as hostile to popular
liberty, and who had before their eyes examples of individual

&#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#946;&#951;, &#948;&#953;&#940; &#964;&#949; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;
&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#942;&#957;, &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#972;&#964;&#949; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;. The like is said
 by the rhetor Aristeides — Or. xii. p. 144, Dindorf.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the phrase of “Halbgrieche” applied by
Bernays and W. v. Humboldt to Aristotle (Bernays, Die Dialoge des
Aristoteles, p. 2, p. 134) is not accurate literally, unless we choose
to treat all the Hellenic colonies as half-Greek. His ancestry was on
both sides fully Hellenic. But it is true of him, in the same
metaphorical sense in which it is true of Phokion. Aristotle was
semi-Macedonian in his sympathies. He had no attachment to Hellas as an
organized system autonomous, self-acting, with an Hellenic city as
president: which attachment would have been considered, by Perikles,
Archidamus, and Epameinondas, as one among the constituents
indispensable to Hellenic patriotism.</p></div>
<p>

 Quintilian — Declamat. 268. “Quis ignorat, ex ipsâ Socratis (quo velut
fonte omnis philosophia manasse creditur)  scholâ evasisse tyrannos et
hostes patriæ suæ?” Compare Athenæus, xi. 508-509.</p></div>
<p>
Such sentiment was probably aggravated by the unparalleled and offensive
 Macedonian demonstration at the Olympic festival of 324 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 It was on that occasion that Alexander, about one year prior to his
decease, sent down a formal rescript, which was read publicly to the
assembled crowd by a herald with loud voice; ordering every Grecian city
 to recall all exiles who had been banished by judicial sentence, and
intimating, that if the rescript were not obeyed spontaneously,
Antipater would be instructed to compel the execution of it by force. A
large number of the exiles whose restitution was thus ordered, were
present on the plain of Olympia, and heard the order proclaimed,
doubtless with undisguised triumph and exultation. So much the keener
must have been the disgust and humiliation among the other Grecian
hearers, who saw the autonomy of each separate city violently trampled
down, without even the pretence of enquiry, by this high-handed sentence
 of the Macedonian conqueror. Among the Athenians especially, the
resentment felt was profound; and a vote was passed appointing deputies
to visit Alexander in person, for the purpose of remonstrating <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>against
 it. The orator Demosthenes, who happened to be named Archi-Theôrus of
Athens (chief of the solemn legation sent to represent Athens) at this
Olympic festival, incurred severe reproach from his accuser Deinarchus,
for having even been seen in personal conversation with the Macedonian
officer who had arrived from Asia as bearer of this odious rescript.<a name="FnAnchor1_24" href="#Footnote1_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_24" id="Footnote1_24"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_24">24</a></span> See the description of this event in History of Greece, ch. xcv. p. 416. </p>
<p>
There is reason for supposing that Hypereides also (as well as
Deinarchus) inveighed against Demosthenes for having publicly sought the
 company of Nikanor at this Olympic festival. At least we know that
Hypereides, in his oration against Demosthenes, made express allusion to
 Nikanor. See Harpokration <i>v.</i> &#925;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#969;&#961;.</p>
<p>
The exordium prefixed to the Pseud-Aristotelian Rhetorica ad Alexandrum,
 announces that discourse to have been composed pursuant to the desire
of Alexander; and notices especially one message transmitted by him to
Aristotle through Nikanor (p. 1420 a. 6, 1421 a. 26-38, &#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;
&#7952;&#948;&#942;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#949; &#925;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#969;&#961;, &amp;c.).</p></div>
<p>
Now it happened that this officer, the bearer of the rescript, was Nikanor of Stageira;<a name="FnAnchor1_25" href="#Footnote1_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
 son of Proxenus who had been Aristotle’s early guardian, and himself
the cherished friend or ward, ultimately the son-in-law, of the
philosopher. We may be certain that Aristotle would gladly embrace the
opportunity of seeing again this attached friend, returning after a long
 absence on service in Asia; that he would be present with him at the
Olympic festival, perhaps receive a visit from him at Athens also. And
the unpopularity of Aristotle at Athens, as identified with Macedonian
imperial authority, would thus be aggravated by his notorious personal
alliance with his fellow-citizen Nikanor, the bearer of that rescript in
 which such authority had been most odiously manifested. </p>

 &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#948;&#959;&#965;.</p>
<p>
Antipater, when re-distributing the satrapies of the Macedonian empire,
after the death both of Alexander and of Perdikkas, appointed Nikanor
prefect or satrap of Kappadokia (Arrian, &#932;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#7944;&#955;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#957;, apud
Photium, cod. 92, s.37, Didot). </p>
<p>
Ammonius, in the life of Aristotle, mentions Nikanor as son of Proxenus
of Atarneus. Sextus Empiricus alludes to Nikanor as son-in-law of
Aristotle (adv. Mathematicos, sect. 258. p. 271, Fabr.). See Ménage ad
Diogen. Laert. v. 12. Robbe’s Life of Aristotle also (Leyden, 1861, p.
2) mentions Nikanor as son of Proxenus. </p>
<p>
Nikanor was appointed afterwards (in 318 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 five years later than the death of Aristotle) by Kassander, son of
Antipater, to be commander of the Macedonian garrison which occupied
Munychia, as a controlling force over Athens (Diodor. xviii. 64). It
will be seen in my History of Greece (ch. xcvi. p. 458) that Kassander
was at that moment playing a difficult game, his father Antipater being
just dead; that he could only get possession of Munychia by artifice,
and that it was important for him to entrust the mission to an officer
who already had connections at Athens; that Nikanor, as adopted son of
Aristotle, possessed probably beforehand acquaintance with Phokion and
the other macedonizing leaders at Athens; so that the ready way in which
 Phokion now fell into co-operation with him is the more easily
explained. </p>
<p>
Nikanor, however, was put to death by Kassander himself, some months afterwards.</p></div>
<p>
During the twelve or thirteen years<a name="FnAnchor1_26" href="#Footnote1_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> of Aristotle’s teaching <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>and
 Alexander’s reign, Athens was administered by macedonizing citizens,
with Phokion and Demades at their head. Under such circumstances, the
enmity of those who hated the imperial philosopher could not pass into
act; nor was it within the contemplation of any one, that only one year
after that rescript which insulted the great Pan-Hellenic festival, the
illustrious conqueror who issued it would die of fever, in the vigour of
 his age and at the height of his power (June, 323 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).
 But as soon as the news of his decease, coming by surprise both on
friends and enemies, became confirmed, the suppressed anti-Macedonian
sentiment burst forth in powerful tide, not merely at Athens, but also
throughout other parts of Greece. There resulted that struggle against
Antipater, known as the Lamian war:<a name="FnAnchor1_27" href="#Footnote1_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
 a gallant struggle, at first promising well, but too soon put down by
superior force, and ending in the occupation of Athens by Antipater with
 a Macedonian garrison in September, 322 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 as well as in the extinction of free speech and free citizenship by the
 suicide of Demosthenes and the execution of Hypereides.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_26" id="Footnote1_26"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_26">26</a></span>
 There remain small fragments of an oration of Demades in defence of his
 administration, or political activity, for twelve years — &#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#948;&#969;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#949;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#962; (Demad. Fragm. 179, 32). The twelve years of Demades,
however, seem to be counted from the battle of Chæroneia in 338 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; so that they end in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 326. See Clinton, Fast. Hellen. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 326.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_27" id="Footnote1_27"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_27">27</a></span> For the account of the Lamian war, see History of Greece, ch. xcv. pp. 420-440. As to the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'anti Macedonian'">anti-Macedonian</span> sentiment prevalent at Athens, see Diodorus, xviii. 10.</p></div>
<p>
During the year immediately succeeding the death of Alexander, the
anti-Macedonian sentiment continued so vehemently preponderant at
Athens, that several of the leading citizens, friends of Phokion, left
the city to join Antipater, though Phokion himself remained, opposing
ineffectually the movement. It was during this period that the enemies
of Aristotle found a favourable opportunity for assailing him. An
indictment on the score of impiety was preferred against him by
Eurymedon the Hierophant (chief priest of the Eleusinian Demeter), aided
 by Demophilus, son of the historian Ephorus. The Hymn or Pæan (still
existing), which Aristotle had composed in commemoration of the death,
and in praise of the character, of the eunuch Hermeias,<a name="FnAnchor1_28" href="#Footnote1_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 was arraigned as a mark of impiety; besides which Aristotle had erected
 at Delphi a statue of Hermeias with an honorific inscription, and was
even alleged to have offered sacrifices to him as to a god. In the
published writings of Aristotle, too, the accusers found various
heretical doctrines, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>suitable
 for sustaining their indictment; as, for example, the declaration that
prayer and sacrifices to the gods were of no avail.<a name="FnAnchor1_29" href="#Footnote1_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 But there can be little doubt that the Hymn, Ode, or Pæan, in honour of
 Hermeias, would be more offensive to the feelings of an ordinary
Athenian than any philosophical dogma extracted from the cautious prose
compositions of Aristotle. It is a hymn, of noble thought and dignified
measure, addressed to Virtue (&#7944;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052; — masculine or military Virtue), in
which are extolled the semi-divine or heroic persons who had fought,
endured, and perished in her service. The name and exploits of Hermeias
are here introduced as the closing parallel and example in a list
beginning with Hêraklês, the Dioskûri, Achilles, and Ajax. Now the poet
Kallistratus, in his memorable Skolion, offers a like compliment to
Harmodius and Aristogeiton; and Pindar, to several free Greeks of noble
family, who paid highly for his epinician Odes now remaining. But all
the persons thus complimented were such as had gained prizes at the
sacred festivals, or had distinguished themselves in other ways which
the public were predisposed to honour; whereas Hermeias was a eunuch,
who began by being a slave, and ended by becoming despot over a free
Grecian community, without any exploit conspicuous to the eye. To many
of the Athenian public it would seem insult, and even impiety, to couple
 Hermeias with the greatest personages of Hellenic mythology, as a
successful competitor for heroic honours. We need only read the
invective of Claudian against Eutropius, to appreciate the incredible
bitterness of indignation and contempt, which was suggested by the
spectacle of a eunuch and a slave exercising high public functions.<a name="FnAnchor1_30" href="#Footnote1_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> And the character of a despot was, to the anti-macedonizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span> Athenians, hardly less odious than either of the others combined with it in Hermeias. </p>
<p>

 Diogen. L. v. 5; Athenæus, xv. 696. The name of Demophilus was
mentioned by Favorinus as also subscribed to the indictment: this
Demophilus was probably son of the historian Ephorus. See Val. Rose,
Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus, p. 582. He took part afterwards in the
indictment against Phokion. As an historian, he completed the narrative
of the Sacred War, which his father Ephorus had left unfinished (Diodor.
 xvi. 14). The words of Athenæus, as far as I can understand them, seem
to imply that he composed a speech for the Hierophant Eurymedon.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_29" id="Footnote1_29"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_29">29</a></span> See the passages from Origen advers. Celsum, cited in Stahr’s Aristotelia, vol. i. p. 146.</p>
<p>
Among the titles of the lost works of Aristotle (No. 14 in the Catalogue
 of Diogenes Laertius, No. 9 in that of the Anonymous; see Rose,
Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus, pp. 12-18), one is &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#917;&#8016;&#967;&#8134;&#962;. From its
position in the Catalogue, it seems plainly to have been a dialogue; and
 the dialogues were the most popular and best-known writings of
Aristotle. Now we know from the Nikomach. Ethica (x. 8, 1178, b. 6-32)
that Aristotle declared all constructive effort, and all action with a
view to external ends, to be inconsistent with the Divine Nature, which
was blest exclusively in theorizing and contemplation. If he advocated
the same doctrine in the dialogue &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#917;&#8016;&#967;&#8134;&#962;, he must have contended
that persons praying could have no additional chance of obtaining the
benefits which they prayed for; and this would have placed him in
conflict with the received opinions. </p>
<p>
Respecting the dialogue &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#917;&#8016;&#967;&#8134;&#962;, see Bernays, Die Dialoge des

 “Omnia cesserunt, eunucho consule, monstra:” this is among the bitter
lines of Claudian, too numerous to cite; but they well deserve to be
read in the original. Compare also, about the ancient sentiment towards
eunuchs, Herodotus, viii. 106; Xenophon, Cyropæd. viii. 3. 15. </p>
<p>
Apellikon thought it worth while to compose a special treatise, for the
purpose of vindicating Aristotle from the aspersions circulated in
regard to his relations with Hermeias. Aristokles speaks of the
vindication as successful (ap. Euseb. P. E. xv. 2).</p></div>
<p>
Taking these particulars into account, we shall see that a charge thus
sustained, when preferred by a venerable priest, during the prevalence
of strong anti-Macedonian feeling, against a notorious friend of
Antipater and Nikanor, was quite sufficient to alarm the prudence of the
 accused. Aristotle bowed to the storm (if indeed he had not already
left Athens, along with other philo-Macedonians) and retired to Chalkis
(in Eubœa),<a name="FnAnchor1_31" href="#Footnote1_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
 then under garrison by Antipater. An accused person at Athens had
always the option of leaving the city, at any time before the day of
trial; Sokrates might have retired, and obtained personal security in
the same manner, if he had chosen to do so. Aristotle must have been
served, of course, with due notice: and according to Athenian custom,
the indictment would be brought into court in his absence, as if he had
been present; various accusers, among them Demochares,<a name="FnAnchor1_32" href="#Footnote1_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
 the nephew of Demosthenes, would probably speak in support of it; and
Aristotle must been found guilty in his absence. But there is no ground
for believing that he intended to abandon Athens, and live at Chalkis,
permanently; the rather, inasmuch as he seems to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>have
 left not only his school, but his library, at Athens under the charge
of Theophrastus. Aristotle knew that the Macedonian chiefs would not
forego supremacy over Greece without a struggle; and, being in personal
correspondence with Antipater himself, he would receive direct assurance
 of this resolution, if assurance were needed. In a question of military
 force, Aristotle probably felt satisfied that Macedonian arms must
prevail; after which the affairs of Athens would be again administered,
at least in the same spirit, as they had been before Alexander’s death,
if not with more complete servility. He would then have returned thither
 to resume his school, in competition with that of Plato under
Xenokrates at the Academy; for he must have been well aware that the
reputation of Athens, as central hearth of Hellenic letters and
philosophy, could not be transferred to Chalkis or to any other city.<a name="FnAnchor1_33" href="#Footnote1_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_31" id="Footnote1_31"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_31">31</a></span>
 That Chalkis was among the Grecian towns then occupied by a Macedonian
garrison is the statement of Brandis (Entwickelungen der Griechischen
Philosophie, i. p. 391, 1862). Though I find no direct authority for
this statement, I adopt it as probable in the highest degree.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_32" id="Footnote1_32"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_32">32</a></span>
 Aristokles (ap. Eusebium Præp. Ev. xv. 2) takes notice of the
allegations of Demochares against Aristotle: That letters of Aristotle
had been detected or captured (&#7937;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#953;), giving information injurious to
Athens: That Aristotle had betrayed Stageira to Philip: That when
Philip, after the capture of Olynthus, was selling into slavery the
Olynthian prisoners, Aristotle was present at the auction (&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#955;&#945;&#966;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#969;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#959;&#965;), and pointed out to him which among the prisoners were
men of the largest property.</p>
<p>
We do not know upon what foundation of fact (if upon any) these
allegations were advanced by a contemporary orator. But they are
curious, as illustrating the view taken of Aristotle by his enemies.
They must have been delivered as parts of one of the accusatory speeches
 on Aristotle’s trial <i>par contumace</i>: for this was the earliest
occasion on which Aristotle’s enemies had the opportunity of publicly
proclaiming their antipathy against him, and they would hardly omit to
avail themselves of it. The Hierophant, the principal accuser, would be
supported by other speakers following him; just as Melêtus, the accuser
of Sokrates, was supported by Anytus and Lykon. The &#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953; of
Demochares were not composed until seventeen years after this epoch —
certainly not earlier than 306 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> — sixteen
 years after the death of Aristotle, when his character was not
prominently before the public. Nevertheless Demochares may possibly have
 included these accusatory allegations against the philosopher in his
&#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;, as well as in his published speech. His invectives against
Antipater, and the friends of Antipater, were numerous and bitter:—
Polybius. xii. 13, 9; Cicero, Brutus, 83; compare Democharis Fragmenta,
in Didot’s Fragm. Historicorum Græcorum, vol. ii. p. 448. Philôn, who
indicted Sophokles (under the &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#969;&#957;) for the law which the
latter had proposed in 306 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> against the philosophers at Athens, had been a friend of Aristotle, &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#947;&#957;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;. Athenæus, xiii. 610.</p></div>

This is what would probably have occurred, when the Lamian war was
finished and the Macedonian garrison installed at Athens, in Sept. 322 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
 — had Aristotle’s life lasted longer. But in or about that very period,
 a little before the death of Demosthenes, he died at Chalkis of
illness; having for some time been troubled with indigestion and
weakness of stomach.<a name="FnAnchor1_34" href="#Footnote1_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> The assertion of Eumêlus and others that he took poison, appears a mere fiction suggested by the analogy of Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchor1_35" href="#Footnote1_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a>
 One of his latest compositions was a defence of himself against the
charge of impiety, and against the allegations of his accusers (as
reported to him, or published) in support of it. A sentence of this
defence remains,<a name="FnAnchor1_36" href="#Footnote1_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> wherein he points out the inconsistency <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>of
 his accusers in affirming that he intended to honour Hermeias as an
immortal, while he had notoriously erected a tomb, and had celebrated
funeral ceremonies to him as a mortal. And in a letter to Antipater, he
said (among other things) that Athens was a desirable residence, but
that the prevalence of sycophancy or false accusation was a sad drawback
 to its value; moreover that he had retired to Chalkis, in order that
the Athenians might not have the opportunity of sinning a second time
against philosophy, as they had already done once, in the person of
Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchor1_37" href="#Footnote1_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 In the same or another letter to Antipater, he adverted to an honorific
 tribute which had been voted to him at Delphi before the death of
Alexander, but the vote for which had been since rescinded. He intimated
 that this disappointment was not indifferent to him, yet at the same
time no serious annoyance.<a name="FnAnchor1_38" href="#Footnote1_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> </p>

 Athenæus xv. p. 696, 697. Probably this reply of Aristotle (though
Zeller, p. 33, declares it to be spurious, in my judgment very
gratuitously), may have been suited to the words of the speech (not
preserved to us) which it was intended to answer. But the reply does not
 meet what I conceive to have been the real feeling in the minds of
those who originated the charge. The logical inconsistency which he
points out did not appear an inconsistency to Greeks generally.
Aristotle had rendered to the deceased Hermeias the same honours (though
 less magnificent in degree) as Alexander to the deceased Hephæstion,
and the Amphipolitans to the deceased Brasidas (Thucyd. v. 11;
Aristotel. Ethic. Nikom. v. 7. 1). In both these cases a tomb was
erected to the deceased, implying mortality; and permanent sacrifices
were offered to him, implying immortality: yet these two proceedings did
 not appear to involve any logical contradiction, in the eyes of the
worshippers. That which offended the Athenians, really, in the case of
Aristotle, was the worthlessness of Hermeias, to whom he rendered these
prodigious honours — eunuch, slave, and despot; an assemblage of what
they considered mean attributes. The solemn measure and character of a
Pæan was disgraced by being applied to such a vile person.</p></div>

 Ammonius, Vit. Aristotelis, p. 48, in Buhle’s Aristot. vol. i.; Ménage
ad Diog. Laert. v. 5, with the passage from Origen (adv. Celsum) there
cited; Ælian, V. H. iii. 36.</p>
<p>
We learn from Diogenes that Theophrastus was indicted for impiety by
Agnonides; but such was the esteem in which Theophrastus was held, that
the indictment utterly failed; and Agnonides was very near incurring the
 fine which every accuser had to pay, if he did not obtain one-fifth of
the suffrages of the Dikasts (Diog. L. v. 37). Now Agnonides comes
forward principally as the vehement accuser of Phokion four years after
the death of Aristotle, during the few months of democratical reaction
brought about by the edicts and interference of Polysperchon (318 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
 after the death of Antipater (History of Greece, ch. xcvi. p. 477).
Agnonides must have felt himself encouraged by what had happened five
years before with Aristotle, to think that he would succeed in a similar
 charge against Theophrastus. But Theophrastus was personally esteemed;
he was not intimately allied with Antipater, or directly protected by
him; moreover, he had composed no hymn to a person like Hermeias.
Accordingly, the indictment recoiled upon the accuser himself.</p></div>

In regard to the person and habits of Aristotle, we are informed that he
 had thin legs and small eyes; that in speech he was somewhat lisping;
that his attire was elegant and even showy; that his table was
well-served — according to his enemies, luxurious above the measure of
philosophy. His pleasing and persuasive manners are especially attested
by Antipater, in a letter, apparently of marked sympathy and esteem,
written shortly after the philosopher’s death.<a name="FnAnchor1_39" href="#Footnote1_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> He was deeply attached to his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>wife
 Pythias, by whom he had a daughter who bore the same name. His wife
having died after some years, he then re-married with a woman of
Stageira, named Herpyllis, who bore him a son called Nikomachus.
Herpyllis lived with him until his death; and the constant as well as
reciprocal attachment between them is attested by his last will.<a name="FnAnchor1_40" href="#Footnote1_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> At the time of his death, his daughter Pythias had not yet attained marriageable age; Nikomachus was probably a child. </p>

satirical drama of the poet Lykophron (ap. Athenæum, ii. p. 55), in
which he derided the suppers of philosophers, for their coarse and
unattractive food: compare the verses of Antiphanes, ap. Athenæ. iii. p.
 98 F.; and Diog. L. vii. 27; Timæus ap. Athenæum, viii. 342. The lines

<p>
The will or testament of the philosopher is preserved.<a name="FnAnchor1_41" href="#Footnote1_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> Its first words constitute Antipater his general executor in the most comprehensive terms,<a name="FnAnchor1_42" href="#Footnote1_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
 words well calculated to ensure that his directions should be really
carried into effect; since not only was Antipater now the supreme
potentate, but Nikanor, the chief beneficiary under the will, was in his
 service and dependent on his orders. Aristotle then proceeds to declare
 that Nikanor shall become his son-in-law, by marriage with his daughter
 Pythias as soon as she shall attain suitable age; also, his general
heir, subject to certain particular bequests and directions, and the
guardian of his infant son Nikomachus. Nikanor being at that time on
service, and perhaps in Asia, Aristotle directs that four friends (named
 Aristomenes, Timarchus, Hipparchus, Diotelês) shall take provisional
care of Herpyllis, his two children, and his effects, until Nikanor can
appear and act: Theophrastus is to be conjoined with these four if he
chooses, and if circumstances permit him.<a name="FnAnchor1_43" href="#Footnote1_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> The daughter <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>Pythias,
 when she attains suitable age, is to become the wife of Nikanor, who
will take the best care both of her and her son Nikomachus, being in the
 joint relation of father and brother to them.<a name="FnAnchor1_44" href="#Footnote1_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
 If Pythias shall die, either before the marriage or after it, but
without leaving offspring, Nikanor shall have discretion to make such
arrangements as may be honourable both for himself and for the testator
respecting Nikomachus and the estate generally. In case of the death of
Nikanor himself, either before the marriage or without offspring, any
directions given by him shall be observed; but Theophrastus shall be
entitled, if he chooses, to become the husband of Pythias, and if
Theophrastus does not choose, then the executors along with Antipater
shall determine what they think best both for her and for Nikomachus.<a name="FnAnchor1_45" href="#Footnote1_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
 The will then proceeds as follows:— “The executors (here Antipater is
not called in to co-operate) with Nikanor, in faithful memory of me and
of the steady affection of Herpyllis towards me, shall take good care of
 her in every way, but especially if she desires to be married, in
giving her away to one not unworthy of me. They shall assign to her,
besides what she has already received, a talent of silver, and three
female slaves chosen by herself, out of the property, together with the
young girl and the Pyrrhæan slave now attached to her person. If she
prefers to reside at Chalkis, she may occupy the lodging near the
garden; if at Stageira, she may live at my paternal house. Whichever of
the two she may prefer, the executors shall provide it with all such
articles of furniture as they deem sufficient for her comfort and
dignity.”<a name="FnAnchor1_46" href="#Footnote1_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> </p>

&amp;c. The testament of Aristotle was known to Hermippus (Athenæus,
xiii. p. 589) about a century later than Aristotle, and the most ancient
 known authority respecting the facts of his life. Stahr (Aristotelia,
vol. i. 159) and Brandis (Arist. p. 62) suppose that what Diogenes gives
 is only an extract from the will; since nothing is said about the
library, and Aristotle would not omit to direct what should be done with
 a library which he so much valued. But to this I reply, that there was
no necessity for his making any provision about the library; he had left
 it at Athens along with his school, in the care of Theophrastus. He
wished it to remain there, and probably considered it as an appendage to
 the school; and it naturally would remain there, if he said nothing
about it in his testament. We must remember (as I have already
intimated) that when Aristotle left Athens, he only contemplated being
absent for a time; and intended to come back and resume his school, when
 Macedonian supremacy should be re-established.</p></div>

 Pausanias (vi. 4, 5) describes a statue of Aristotle which he saw at

The four
persons here named were probably present at Chalkis, so that Aristotle
could count upon them; but at the time when this will was made,
Theophrastus was at Athens, conducting the Aristotelian school; and in
the critical condition of Grecian politics, there was room for doubt how
 far he could securely or prudently act in this matter. </p>
<p>
The words of Diogenes — &#7957;&#969;&#962; &#948;’ &#7938;&#957; &#925;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#969;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#8131; — are rendered in the improved translation of the edition by Firmin Didot, “<i>quoad vero Nicanor adolescat</i>,”
 &amp;c. I cannot think this a correct understanding, either of the
words or of the fact. Nikanor was not a minor under age, but an officer
on active service. The translation given by Ménage appears to me more
true — “<i>tantisper dum redux sit Nicanor:</i>” (ad. D. L. v. 12.)</p></div>

 Diog. L. v. 13. In following the phraseology of this testament, we
remark that when Aristotle makes allusion to these inauspicious
possibilities — the death of Nikanor or of Pythias, he annexes to them a
 deprecatory phrase: &#7952;&#8048;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#8135; — &#8003; &#956;&#8052; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#959; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;,

near the garden” may probably have been the residence occupied by
Aristotle himself, during his temporary residence at Chalkis. The
mention of his paternal house, which he still possessed at Stageira,
seems to imply that Philip, when he destroyed that town, respected the
house therein which had belonged to his father’s physician. </p>
<p>
We find in the will of Theophrastus (Diog. L. v. 52) mention made of a
property (&#967;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957;) at Stageira belonging to Theophrastus, which he
bequeaths to Kallinus. Probably this is the same property which had once
 belonged to Aristotle; for I do not see how else Theophrastus (who was a
 native of Eresus in Lesbos) could have become possessed of property at
Stageira.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>Aristotle
 proceeds to direct that Nikanor shall make comfortable provision for
several persons mentioned by name, male and female, most of them slaves,
 but one (Myrmex), seemingly, a free boarder or pupil, whose property he
 had undertaken to manage. Two or three of these slaves are ordered to
be liberated, and to receive presents, as soon as his daughter Pythias
shall be married. He strictly enjoins that not one of the youthful
slaves who attended him shall be sold. They are to be brought up and
kept in employment; when of mature age, they are to be liberated
according as they shew themselves worthy.<a name="FnAnchor1_47" href="#Footnote1_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a></p>

Aristotle had in his lifetime ordered, from a sculptor named Gryllion,
busts of Nikanor and of the mother of Nikanor; he intended farther to
order from the same sculptor a bust of Proxenus, Nikanor’s father.
Nikanor is instructed by the will to complete these orders, and to
dedicate the busts properly when brought in. A bust of the mother of
Aristotle is to be dedicated to Demeter at Nemea, or in any other place
which Nikanor may prefer; another bust of Arimnêstus (brother of
Aristotle) is to be dedicated as a memento of the same, since he has
died childless.<a name="FnAnchor1_48" href="#Footnote1_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a></p>

<p>
During some past danger of Nikanor (we do not know what) Aristotle had
made a vow of four marble animal figures, in case the danger were
averted, to Zeus the Preserver and Athênê the Preserver. Nikanor is
directed to fulfil this vow and to dedicate the figures in Stageira.<a name="FnAnchor1_49" href="#Footnote1_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>

<p>
Here is a vow, made by Aristotle to the gods under some unknown previous
 emergency, which he orders his executor to fulfil. I presume that the
last words of direction given by Sokrates before his death to Kriton
were of the same nature: “We owe a cock to Æsculapius: pay the debt, and
 do not fail.” (See my preceding work, Plato and the other Companions of
 Sokrates, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#v2page419">vol. ii. ch. 23, p. 195</a>.)</p></div>

Lastly, wherever Aristotle is buried, the bones of his deceased wife

This testament is interesting, as it illustrates the personal
circumstances and sentiments of the philosopher, evincing an
affectionate forethought and solicitude for those who were in domestic
relations with him. As far as we can judge, the establishment and
property which he left must have been an ample one.<a name="FnAnchor1_51" href="#Footnote1_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> How the provisions of the will were executed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>or
 what became of most persons named in it, we do not know, except that
Pythias the daughter of Aristotle was married three times: first, to
Nikanor (according to the will); secondly, to Proklês, descendant of
Demaratus (the king of Sparta formerly banished to Asia) by whom she had
 two sons, Proklês and Demaratus, afterwards pupils in the school of
Theophrastus;  thirdly, to a physician named Metrodôrus, by whom she had
 a son named Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchor1_52" href="#Footnote1_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a></p>

 The elder Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 12, 46; compare also Diogen. L. v. 1, 16)
mentions that in the sale of Aristotle’s effects by his heirs there were
 included seventy dishes or pans (<i>patinas</i>, earthenware). Pliny
considered this as a mark of luxurious living; since (according to
Fenestella) “tripatinium appellabatur summam cœnarum lautitia.”</p></div>

banishment, or rather voluntary exile, of Demaratus to Asia, in the
reign of Darius I. king of Persia, see Herodot. vi. 70. Some towns and
lands were assigned to him in Æolis, where Xenophon found his descendant
 Prokles settled, after the conclusion of the Cyreian expedition (Xen.
Anab. vii. 8, 17).</p>
<p>
Respecting this younger Aristotle — son of Metrodorus and grandson of
the great philosopher — mention is made in the testament of
Theophrastus, and directions are given for promoting his improvement in
philosophy (Diog. La. v. 53). Nikomachus was brought up chiefly by
Theophrastus, but perished young in battle (Aristokles ap. Euseb. Præp.
Ev. xv. 2).</p></div>

There existed in antiquity several works, partly by contemporaries like
the Megaric Eubulides, partly by subsequent Platonists, in which
Aristotle was reproached with ingratitude to Plato,<a name="FnAnchor1_53" href="#Footnote1_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
 servility to the Macedonian power, love of costly display and
indulgences, &amp;c. What proportion of truth may lie at the bottom of
these charges we do not know enough to determine confidently; but we
know that he had many enemies, philosophical as well as political;<a name="FnAnchor1_54" href="#Footnote1_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> and controversy on those grounds (then as now) was rarely kept free from personal slander and invective.</p>

<p>
The accusation of ingratitude or unbecoming behaviour to Plato is no way
 proved by any evidence now remaining. It seems to have been suggested
to the Platonists mainly, if not wholly, by the direct rivalry of
Aristotle in setting up a second philosophical school at Athens,
alongside of the Academy; by his independent, self-working,
philosophical speculation; and by the often-repeated opposition which he
 made to some capital doctrines of Plato, especially to the so-called
Platonic Ideas.<a name="FnAnchor1_55" href="#Footnote1_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>Such
 opposition was indeed expressed, as far as we can judge, in terms of
respectful courtesy, and sometimes even of affectionate regret; examples
 of which we shall have to notice in going through the Aristotelian
writings. Yet some Platonists seem to have thought that direct attack on
 the master’s doctrines was undutiful and ungrateful in the pupil,
however unexceptionable the language might be. They also thought,
probably, that the critic misrepresented what he sought to refute.
Whether Aristotle really believed that he had superior claims to be made
 Scholarch of the Platonic school at the death of Plato in 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, or at the death of Speusippus in 339 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 is a point which we can neither affirm nor deny. But we can easily
understand that the act of setting up a new philosophical school at
Athens, though perfectly fair and admissible on his part, was a hostile
competition sure both to damage and offend the pre-established school,
and likely enough to be resented with unbecoming asperity. Ingratitude
towards the great common master Plato, with arrogant claims of
superiority over fellow-pupils, were the allegations which this
resentment would suggest, and which many Platonists in the Academy would
 not scruple to advance against their macedonizing rival at the Lykeium.</p>

 This is what lies at the bottom of the charges advanced by Eubulides,
probably derived from the Platonists, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#917;&#8016;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#942;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#954;&#945;&#964;’
 &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#8179; &#968;&#949;&#973;&#948;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#966;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#969;&#957;, &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#953; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#953; &#956;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#940;
&#964;&#949; &#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#953; (Aristokles ap. Euseb. Præp. Ev. xv. 2).
There can be no possible basis for this last charge — destroying or
corrupting the books of Plato — except that Aristotle had sharply
criticized them, and was supposed to have mis-stated or unfairly
discredited them.</p>
<p>
The frequently recurring protest of Aristotle against the Platonic
doctrine of Ideas may be read now in the Analytica, Topica, Metaphysica,
 and Ethica Nikomachea, but was introduced even in the lost Dialogues.
See Plutarch adv. Kolôten, c. 14; and Proklus adv. Joann. Philoponum ap.
 Bernays, Die Dialoge des Aristoteles, not. 22, p. 151.</p></div>
<p>
Such allegations moreover would find easy credence from other men of
letters, whose enmity Aristotle had incurred, and to a certain extent
even provoked — Isokrates and his numerous disciples. </p>
<p>
This celebrated rhetor was an elderly man at the zenith of his glory and
 influence, during those earlier years which Aristotle passed at Athens
before the decease of Plato. The Isokratean school was then the first in
 Greece, frequented by the most promising pupils from cities near and
far, perhaps even by Aristotle himself. The political views and
handling, as well as the rhetorical style of which the master set the
example, found many imitators. Illustrious statesmen, speakers, and
writers traced their improvement to this teaching. So many of the
pupils, indeed, acquired celebrity — among them Theodektês, Theopompus,
Ephorus, Naukrates, Philiskus, Kephisodôrus, and others — that Hermippus<a name="FnAnchor1_56" href="#Footnote1_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a>
 thought it worth his while to draw up a catalogue of them: many must
have been persons of opulent family, highly valuing the benefit received
 from Isokrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span> since each of them was required to pay to him a fee of 1000 drachmæ.<a name="FnAnchor1_57" href="#Footnote1_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> During the first sojourn of Aristotle in Athens (362-347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>),
 while he was still attached to and receiving instruction from Plato, he
 appears to have devoted himself more to rhetoric than to philosophy,
and even to have given public lessons or lectures on rhetoric. He thus
entered into rivalry with Isokrates, for whom, as a teacher and author,
he contracted dislike or contempt. </p>

 Phasêlis — &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945;, &#7992;&#963;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#962;. To have gone through a
course of teaching from Isokrates, was evidently considered as a
distinction of some importance.</p></div>
<p>
The composition of Isokrates was extremely elegant: his structure of
sentences was elaborate even to excess, his arrangement of words
rhythmical, his phrases nicely balanced in antithetical equipoise, like
those of his master Gorgias; the recital of his discourses proved highly
 captivating to the ear.<a name="FnAnchor1_58" href="#Footnote1_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
 Moreover, he had composed a book of rhetorical precepts known and
esteemed by Cicero and Quintilian. Besides such technical excellence,
Isokrates strove to attain, and to a certain extent actually attained, a
 higher order of merit. He familiarized his pupils with thoughts and
arguments of lofty bearing and comprehensive interest; not assisting
them to gain victory either <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>in
 any real issue tried before the Dikasts, or in any express motion about
 to be voted on by the public assembly, but predisposing their minds to
prize above all things the great Pan-hellenic aggregate — its
independence in regard to external force, and internal harmony among its
 constituent cities, with a reasonable recognition of presidential
authority, equitably divided between Athens and Sparta, and exercised
with moderation by both. He inculcated  sober habits and deference to
legal authority on the part of the democrats of Athens; he impressed
upon princes, like Philip and Nikokles, the importance of just and mild
bearing towards subjects.<a name="FnAnchor1_59" href="#Footnote1_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 Such is the general strain of the discourses which we now possess from
Isokrates; though he appears to have adopted it only in middle life,
having begun at first in the more usual track of the logographer —
composing speeches to be delivered before the Dikastery by actual
plaintiffs or defendants,<a name="FnAnchor1_60" href="#Footnote1_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
 and acquiring thus both reputation and profit. His reputation as a
teacher was not only maintained but even increased when he altered his
style; and he made himself peculiarly attractive to foreign pupils who
desired to acquire a command of graceful expressions, without special
reference to the Athenian Assembly and Dikastery. But his new style
being midway between Demosthenes and Plato — between the practical
advocate and politician on one side, and the generalizing or speculative
 philosopher on the other — he incurred as a semi-philosopher,
professing to have discovered the <i>juste milieu</i>, more or less of disparagement from both extremes;<a name="FnAnchor1_61" href="#Footnote1_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>Aristotle,
 while yet a young man in the Platonic school, raised an ardent
controversy against his works, on the ground both of composition and
teaching. Though the whole controversy is now lost, there is good ground
 for believing that Aristotle must have displayed no small acrimony. He
appears to have impugned the Isokratean discourses, partly as containing
 improper dogmas, partly as specimens of mere unimpressive elegance,
intended for show, pomp, and immediate admiration from the hearer — <i>ad implendas aures</i> — but destitute both of comprehensive theory and of applicability to any useful purpose.<a name="FnAnchor1_62" href="#Footnote1_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>
 Kephisodôrus, an intimate friend and pupil of Isokrates, defended him
in an express reply, attacking both Aristotle the scholar and Plato the
master. This reply was in four books, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>Dionysius characterizes it by an epithet of the highest praise.<a name="FnAnchor1_63" href="#Footnote1_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a></p>

 Dionysius, while admiring Isocrates, complains of him, and complains
still more of his imitators, as somewhat monotonous, wanting in
flexibility and variety (De Compos. Verborum, p. 134). Yet he pronounces
 Isokrates and Lysias to be more natural, shewing less of craft and art
than Isæus and Demosthenes (De Isæo Judicium, p. 592). Isokrates &#964;&#8056;&#957;
&#8004;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7972;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;&#962;, &#950;&#951;&#955;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;
 &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#915;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#957;. (Dionys. Hal. ad Pompeium de Platone, p. 764; also De
Isæo Judicium, p. 592; besides the special chapter, p. 534, seq., which
he has devoted to Isokrates.)</p>
<p>
Cicero, De Oratore, iii. 44, 173: “Idque princeps Isocrates instituisse
fertur, ut inconditam antiquorum dicendi consuetudinem delectationis
atque aurium causâ, quemadmodum scribit discipulus ejus Naucrates,
numeris adstringeret.” Compare Cicero, Orator. 52, 175, 176.</p>
<p>
The reference to Naucrates (whose works have not been preserved, though
Dionysius commends his &#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#962;, Ars. Rhet. p. 259) is
interesting, as it shews what was said of Isokrates by his own
disciples. Cicero says of the doctrines in his own dialogue De Oratore
(Epist. ad Famil. i. 9, 23), “Abhorrent a communibus præceptis, et omnem
 antiquorum, et <i>Aristoteleam et Isocrateam</i>, rationem oratoriam complectuntur.” About the &#932;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951; of Isokrates, see Spengel, &#931;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#8052; &#932;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#8182;&#957; (Munich), pp. 155-170.</p></div>

 Dionysius Hal. dwells emphatically on the lofty morality inculcated in
the discourses of Isokrates, and recommends them as most improving study
 to all politicians (De Isocrate Judic. pp. 536, 544, 555, seq.) — more
improving than the writers purely theoretical, among whom he probably
numbered Plato and Aristotle.</p></div>

 Dionysius Hal. De Isocrate Judicium, pp. 576, 577, Reiske: &#948;&#941;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#965;

Isokrates, denied that Isokrates had ever written any judicial orations;
 while Kephisodôrus, the disciple of Isokrates, in his reply to
Aristotle’s accusations, admitted that Isokrates had composed a few, but
 only a few. Dionysius accepts the allegation of Kephisodôrus and
discredits that of Aristotle: I, for my part, believe the allegation of
Aristotle, upon a matter of fact which he had the means of knowing.
Cicero also affirms (Brutus, xii. 46-48), on the authority of Aristotle,
 that Isokrates distinguished himself at first as a composer of speeches
 intended to be delivered by actual pleaders in the Dikastery or
Ekklesia; and that he afterwards altered his style. And this is what
Aristotle says (respecting Isokrates) in Rhetoric. i. 9, 1368, a. 20,

 altered the substantive to &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;; in my judgment, not wisely. I
 do not perceive the meaning or pertinence of &#7936;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; in that
sentence.</p></div>

 Cicero, De Oratore, iii. 35, 141. “Itaque ipse Aristoteles quum florere
 Isocratem nobilitate discipulorum videret, quod ipse suas disputationes
 a causis forensibus et civilibus ad inanem sermonis elegantiam
transtulisset, mutavit repente totam formam prope disciplinæ suæ,
versumque quendam Philoctetæ paulo secus dixit. Ille enim ‘turpe sibi
ait esse tacere, quum barbaros’ — hic autem, ‘quum Isocratem’ —
‘pateretur dicere’” See <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Quintillian'">Quintilian</span>,
 Inst. Or. iv. 2, 196; and Cicero, Orator. 19, 62: “Aristoteles
Isocratem ipsum lacessivit.” Also, ib. 51, 172: “Omitto Isocratem
discipulosque ejus Ephorum et Naucratem; quanquam orationis faciendæ et
ornandæ auctores locupletissimi summi ipsi oratores esse debebant. Sed
quis omnium doctior, quis acutior, quis in rebus vel inveniendis vel
judicandis acrior Aristotele fuit? <i>Quis porro Isocrati adversatus est infensius?</i>”
 That Aristotle was the first to assail Isokrates, and that Kephisodôrus
 wrote only in reply, is expressly stated by Numenius, ap. Euseb. Pr.
Ev. xiv. 6: &#8001; &#922;&#951;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8052; &#8017;&#960;’ &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8183; &#964;&#8056;&#957;

1, p. 126: “Nam et Isocratis præstantissimi discipuli fuerunt in omni
studiorum genere; eoque jam seniore (octavum enim et nonagesimum
implevit annum) pomeridianis scholis Aristoteles præcipere artem
oratoriam cœpit; noto quidem illo (ut traditur) versu ex Philoctetâ <i>frequenter usus</i>: &#913;&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#963;&#953;&#969;&#960;&#8119;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7992;&#963;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#7952;&#8119;&#957; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;.”</p>
<p>
Diogenes La. (v. 3) maintains that Aristotle turned the parody not against <i>Isokrates</i>, but against <i>Xenokrates</i>:
 &#913;&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#963;&#953;&#969;&#960;&#8119;&#957;, &#926;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#948;’ &#7952;&#8119;&#957; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;. But the authority of Cicero
and Quintilian is decidedly preferable. When we recollect that the
parody was employed by a young man, as yet little known, against a
teacher advanced in age, and greatly frequented as well as admired by
pupils, it will appear sufficiently offensive. Moreover, it does not
seem at all pertinent; for the defects of Isokrates, however great they
may have been, were not those of analogy with &#946;&#940;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;, but the direct
reverse. Dionysius must have been forcibly struck with the bitter <i>animus</i>
 displayed by Aristotle against Isokrates, when he makes it a reason for
 rejecting the explicit averment of Aristotle as to a matter of fact:
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8020;&#964;’ &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; <span class="gesp">&#8165;&#965;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;</span> (De Isocr. Jud. p. 577).</p>
<p>
Mr. Cope, in his Introduction to Aristotle’s Rhetoric (p. 39, seq.),
gives a just representation of the probable relations between Aristotle
and Isokrates; though I do not concur in the unfavourable opinion which
he expresses about “the malignant influence exercised by Isokrates upon
education in general” (p. 40). Mr. Cope at the same time remarks, that
“Aristotle in the Rhetorica draws a greater number of illustrations of
excellences of style from Isokrates than from any other author” (p. 41);
 and he adds, very truly, that the absence of any evidence of ill
feeling towards Isokrates in Aristotle’s later work, and the existence
of such ill feeling as an actual fact at an earlier period, are
perfectly reconcileable in themselves (p. 42).</p>
<p>
That the Rhetorica of Aristotle which we now possess is a work of his
later age, certainly published, perhaps composed, during his second
residence at Athens, I hold with Mr. Cope and other antecedent critics.</p></div>

 contended that you might pick out, even from the very best poets and
sophists, &#7955;&#957; &#7970; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#8182;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;. This implies that Aristotle, in
attacking Isokrates, had cited various extracts which he denounced as
exceptionable.</p></div>
<p>
These polemics of Aristotle were begun during his first residence at Athens, prior to 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 the year of Plato’s decease, and at the time when he was still
accounted a member of the Platonic school. They exemplify the rivalry
between that school and the Isokratean, which were then the two
competing places of education at Athens: and we learn that Aristotle, at
 that time only a half-fledged Platonist, opened on his own account not a
 new philosophical school in competition with Plato, as some state, but a
 new rhetorical school in opposition to Isokrates.<a name="FnAnchor1_64" href="#Footnote1_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> But the case was different at the latter epoch, 335 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 when Aristotle came to reside at Athens for the second time. Isokrates
was then dead, leaving no successor, so that his rhetorical school
expired with him. Aristotle preferred philosophy to rhetoric: he was no
longer trammelled by the living presence and authority of Plato. The
Platonic school at the Academy stood at that time alone, under
Xenokrates, who, though an earnest and dignified philosopher, was
deficient in grace and in persuasiveness, and had been criticized for
this defect even by Plato himself. Aristotle possessed those gifts in
large measure, as we know from the testimony of Antipater. By these
circumstances, coupled with his own established reputation and
well-grounded self-esteem, he was encouraged to commence a new
philosophical school; a school, in which philosophy formed the express
subject of the morning lecture, while rhetoric was included as one among
 the subjects of more varied and popular instruction given in the
afternoon.<a name="FnAnchor1_65" href="#Footnote1_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> During the twelve ensuing years, Aristotle’s rivalry was mainly against <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>the
 Platonists or Xenokrateans at the Academy; embittered on both sides by
acrimonious feelings, which these expressed by complaining of his
ingratitude and unfairness towards the common master, Plato.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_64" id="Footnote1_64"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_64">64</a></span>
 That Aristotle had a school at Athens before the death of Plato we may
see by what Strabo (xiii. 610) says about Hermeias: &#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#948;’
&#7944;&#952;&#942;&#957;&#8131;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7968;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;. Compare Cicero,
Orator. 46; also Michelet, Essai sur la Métaphys. d’Aristote, p. 227.
The statement that Aristotle during Plato’s lifetime tried to set up a
rival school against him, is repeated by all the biographers, who do not
 however believe it to be true, though they cite Aristoxenus as its
warrant. I conceive that they have mistaken what Aristoxenus said; and
that they have confounded the school which Aristotle first set up as a
rhetor, against Isokrates, with that which he afterwards set up as a
philosopher, against Xenokrates.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote1_65" id="Footnote1_65"></a><a href="#FnAnchor1_65">65</a></span> Aulus Gellius, N. A. xx. 5. Quintilian (see <a href="#Footnote1_62">note</a> on p. <span class="correction" title="corrected from unchanged 1st edition '35'">24</span>)
 puts the rhetorical “pomeridianæ scholæ” within the lifetime of
Isokrates; but Aristotle did not then lecture on philosophy in the
morning.</p></div>
<p>
There were thus, at Athens, three distinct parties inspired with
unfriendly sentiment towards Aristotle: first, the Isokrateans;
afterwards, the Platonists; along with both, the anti-Macedonian
politicians. Hence we can account for what Themistius entitles the “army
 of assailants” (&#963;&#964;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#8005;&#955;&#959;&#957;) that fastened upon him, for the
unfavourable colouring with which his domestic circumstances are
presented, and for the necessity under which he lay of Macedonian
protection; so that when such protection was nullified, giving place to a
 reactionary fervour, his residence at Athens became both disagreeable

ARISTOTELIAN CANON.</span> </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth chapters of my work on ‘Plato and the Other
Companions of Sokrates,’ I investigated the question of the Platonic
Canon, and attempted to determine, upon the best grounds open to us, the
 question, What are the real works of Plato? I now propose to discuss
the like question respecting Aristotle.</p>
<p>
But the premisses for such a discussion are much less simple in regard
to Aristotle than in regard to Plato. As far as the testimony of
antiquity goes, we learn that the Canon of Thrasyllus, dating at least
from the time of the Byzantine Aristophanes, and probably from an
earlier time, was believed by all readers to contain the authentic works
 of Plato and none others; an assemblage of dialogues, some unfinished,
but each undivided and unbroken. The only exception to unanimity in
regard to the Platonic Canon, applies to ten dialogues, which were
received by some (we do not know by how many, or by whom) as Platonic,
but which, as Diogenes informs us, were rejected by agreement of the
most known and competent critics. This is as near to unanimity as can be
 expected. The doubts, now so multiplied, respecting the authenticity of
 various dialogues included in the Canon of Thrasyllus, have all
originated with modern scholars since the beginning of the present
century, or at least since the earlier compositions of Wyttenbach. It
was my task to appreciate the value of those doubts; and, in declining
to be guided by them, I was at least able to consider myself as adhering
 to the views of all known ancient critics.</p>
<p>
Very different is the case when we attempt to frame an Aristotelian
Canon, comprising all the works of Aristotle and none others. We find
the problem far more complicated, and the matters of evidence at once
more defective, more uncertain, and more contradictory.</p>
<p>
The different works now remaining, and published in the Berlin edition
of Aristotle, are forty-six in number. But, among these, several were
disallowed or suspected even by some ancient <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>critics,
 while modern critics have extended the like judgment yet farther. Of
several others again, the component sections (either the <i>books</i>,
in our present phraseology, or portions thereof) appear to have existed
once as detached rolls, to have become disjointed or even to have parted
 company, and to have been re-arranged or put together into aggregates,
according to the judgment of critics and librarians. Examples of such
doubtful aggregates, or doubtful arrangements, will appear when we
review the separate Aristotelian compositions (the Metaphysica,
Politica, &amp;c.). It is, however, by one or more of these forty-six
titles that Aristotle is known to modern students, and was known to
mediæval students. </p>
<p>
But the case was very different with ancient <i>literati</i>, such as
Eratosthenes, Polybius, Cicero, Strabo, Plutarch, &amp;c., down to the
time of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Athenæus, Diogenes Laertius, &amp;c.,
towards the close of the second century after the Christian era. It is
certain that these ancients perused many works of Aristotle, or
generally recognized as his, which we do not now possess; and among
those which we do now possess, there are many which it is not certain
that they perused, or even knew. </p>
<p>
Diogenes Laertius, after affirming generally that Aristotle had composed
 a prodigious number of books (&#960;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#945;), proceeds to say,
that, in consequence of the excellence of the author in every variety of
 composition, he thinks it proper to indicate them briefly.<a name="FnAnchor2_1" href="#Footnote2_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 He then enumerates one hundred and forty-six distinct titles of works,
with the number of books or sections contained in each work. The
subjects are exceedingly heterogeneous, and the form of composition
likewise very different; those which come first in the list being
Dialogues,<a name="FnAnchor2_2" href="#Footnote2_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 while those which come last are Epistles, Hexameters, and Elegies. At
the close of the list we read: “All of them together are 445,270 lines,
and this is the number of books (works) composed by Aristotle.”<a name="FnAnchor2_3" href="#Footnote2_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> A little farther on, Diogenes adds, as an evidence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>of
 the extraordinary diligence and inventive force of Aristotle, that the
books (works) enumerated in the preceding list were nearly four hundred
in number, and that these were not contested by any one; but that there
were many other writings, and <i>dicta</i> besides, ascribed to Aristotle — ascribed (we must understand him to mean) erroneously, or at least so as to leave much doubt.<a name="FnAnchor2_4" href="#Footnote2_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

 Bernays has pointed out (in his valuable treatise, Die Dialoge des
Aristoteles, p. 133) that the first in order, nineteen in number, among
the titles enumerated by Diogenes, designate Dialogues. The longest of
them, those which included more than one book or section, are enumerated
 first of all. Some of the dialogues appear to have coincided, either in
 title or in subject, with some of the Platonic:— &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#916;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#951;&#962;, in
four books (comparable with Plato’s Republic); &#928;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;, in two books;
&#931;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962;, &#924;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#931;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;, each in one book; all similar in title
to works of Plato; perhaps also another, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8165;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#7970; &#915;&#961;&#973;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;, the

 Diog. La. v. 34. Heitz (Die Verlorenen Schriften des Aristoteles, p.
17) notices, as a fact invalidating the trustworthiness of the catalogue
 given by Diogenes, that Diogenes, in other places, alludes to
Aristotelian compositions which are not mentioned in his own catalogue.
For example, though Diogenes, in the catalogue, allows only five books
to the Ethica, yet he himself alludes (v. 21) to the seventh book of the
 Ethica. But this example can hardly be relied upon, because &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183;
&#7953;&#946;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#8179; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957; is only a conjecture of H. Stephens or Ménage. The
only case which Heitz really finds to sustain his remark, is the passage
 of the Proœmium (i. 8), where Diogenes cites Aristotle &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#924;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8183;,
that work not being named in his catalogue. But there is another case
(not noticed by Heitz) which appears to me still stronger. Diogenes
cites at length the Hymn or Pæan composed by Aristotle in honour of
Hermeias. Now there is no general head of his catalogue under which this
 hymn could fall. Here Anonymus (to be presently mentioned) has a
superiority over Diogenes; for he introduces, towards the close of his
catalogue, one general head — &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#974;&#956;&#953;&#945; &#7970; &#8021;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;, which is not to be found
 in Diogenes.</p></div>
<p>
We have another distinct enumeration of the titles of Aristotle’s works,
 prepared by an anonymous biographer cited in the notes of Ménage to
Diogenes Laertius.<a name="FnAnchor2_5" href="#Footnote2_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 This anonymous list contains only one hundred and twenty-seven titles,
being nineteen less than the list in Diogenes. The greater number of
titles are the same in both; but Anonymus has eight titles which are not
 found in Diogenes, while Diogenes has twenty-seven titles which are not
 given by Anonymus. There are therefore thirty-five titles which rest on
 the evidence of one alone out of the two lists. Anonymus does not
specify any total number of lines; nevertheless he gives the total
number of <i>books</i> composed by Aristotle as being nearly four
hundred — the same as Diogenes. This total number cannot be elicited out
 of the items enumerated by Anonymus; but it may be made to coincide
pretty nearly with the items in Diogenes,<a name="FnAnchor2_6" href="#Footnote2_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> provided we understand by <i>books</i>, sections or subdivisions of one and the same title or work. </p>

Professor Heitz, Die Verlorenen Schriften des Aristoteles, p. 15

 Heitz, Die Verl. Schrift. des Aristot. p. 51. Such coincidence assumes
that we reckon the &#928;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953; and the Epistles each as one book.</p>
<p>
I think it unnecessary to transcribe these catalogues of the titles of
works mostly lost. The reader will find them clearly printed in the
learned work of Val. Rose, Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus, pp. 12-20.</p></div>
<p>
The two catalogues just mentioned, agreeing as they do in the total
number of books and in the greater part of the items, may probably be
considered not as original and copy, but as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>inaccurate
 transcripts from the same original authority. Yet neither of the two
transcribers tells us what that original authority was. We may, however,
 be certain that each of them considered his catalogue to comprehend all
 that Aristotle could be affirmed on good authority to have published;
Diogenes plainly signifies thus much, when he gives not only the total
number of books, but the total number of lines. Such being the case, we
expect to find in it, of course, the titles of the forty-six works
composing the Berlin edition of Aristotle now before us. But this
expectation is disappointed. The far greater number of the Aristotelian
works which we now peruse are not specified either in the list of
Diogenes, or in that of Anonymus.<a name="FnAnchor2_7" href="#Footnote2_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 Moreover, the lists also fail to specify the titles of various works
which are not now extant, but which we know from Aristotle himself that
he really composed.<a name="FnAnchor2_8" href="#Footnote2_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> </p>

 Heitz, Verl. Schr. Aristot. p. 18, remarks that “In diesem
Verzeichnisse (that of Diogenes) die bei weitem grösste Zahl derjenigen
Schriften fehlt, welche wir heute noch besitzen, und die wir als den
eigentlichen Kern der aristotelischen Lehre enthaltend zu betrachten
gewohnt sind.” Cf. p. 32. Brandis expresses himself substantially to the
 same effect (Aristoteles, Berlin, 1853, pp. 77, 78, 96); and Zeller
also (Gesch. der Phil. 2nd ed. Aristot. Schriften, p. 43).</p></div>

<p>
The last-mentioned fact is in itself sufficiently strange and difficult
to explain, and our difficulty becomes aggravated when we combine it
with another fact hardly less surprising. Both Cicero, and other writers
 of the century subsequent to him (Dionysius Hal., Quintilian, &amp;c.),
 make reference to Aristotle,  and especially to his dialogues, of which
 none have been preserved, though the titles of several are given in the
 two catalogues mentioned above. These writers bestow much encomium on
the style of Aristotle; but what is remarkable is, that they ascribe to
it attributes which even his warmest admirers will hardly find in the
Aristotelian works now remaining. Cicero extols the sweetness, the
abundance, the variety, the rhetorical force which he discovered in
Aristotle’s writings: he even goes so far as to employ the phrase
“flumen orationis aureum” (a golden stream of speech), in characterizing
 the Aristotelian style.<a name="FnAnchor2_9" href="#Footnote2_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 Such predicates may have been correct, indeed were doubtless correct,
in regard to the dialogues, and perhaps other lost works of Aristotle;
but they describe exactly the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>opposite<a name="FnAnchor2_10" href="#Footnote2_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 of what we find in all the works preserved. With most of these (except
the History of Animals) Cicero manifests no acquaintance; and some of
the best modern critics declare him to have been ignorant of them.<a name="FnAnchor2_11" href="#Footnote2_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 Nor do other ancient authors, Plutarch, Athenæus, Diogenes Laertius,
&amp;c., give evidence of having been acquainted with the principal
works of Aristotle known to us. They make reference only to works
enumerated in the Catalogue of Diogenes Laertius.<a name="FnAnchor2_12" href="#Footnote2_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

 Cicero, Acad. Prior. ii. 38, 119: “Quum enim tuus iste Stoicus sapiens
syllabatim tibi ista dixerit, veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens
Aristoteles, qui illum desipere dicat.” Also Topica, i. 3. “Quibus (<i>i.e.</i>
 those who were ignorant of Aristotle) eo minus ignoscendum est, quod
non modo rebus iis, quæ ab illo dictæ et inventæ sunt, adlici debuerunt,
 sed dicendi quoque incredibili quâdam quum copiâ, tum suavitate.” Also
De Oratore, i. 11, 49; Brutus, 31, 121; De Nat. Deor. ii. 37; De
Inventione, ii. 2; De Finibus, i. 5, 14; Epistol. ad Atticum, ii. 1,
where he speaks of the “Aristotelia pigmenta,” along with the &#956;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;
 of Isokrates. Dionysius Hal. recommends the style of Aristotle in equal
 terms of admiration: &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#960;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#956;&#943;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#949;

187). Quintilian extols the “eloquendi suavitas” among Aristotle’s
excellences (Inst. Or. X. i. p. 510). Demetrius Phalereus (or the author
 who bears that title), De Eloquentiâ, s. 128, commends &#945;&#7985; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;
&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#962;. David the Armenian, who speaks of him (having reference to the
dialogue) as &#7944;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#965; &#947;&#941;&#956;&#969;&#957; (the correction of Bernays, Dial.

of predecessors (Scholia ad Categor. p. 26, b. 36, Brandis).</p>
<p>
Bernays (Die Dialoge des Aristoteles, pp. 3-5) points out how little
justice has been done by modern critics to the literary merits,
exhibited in the dialogues and other works now lost, of one whom <i>we</i> know only as a “dornichten und wortkargen Systematiker.”</p></div>

 Valentine Rose, Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus, p. 23: “Cicero
philosophicis certe ipsius Aristotelis libris nunquam usus est.” Heitz,
Die Verlor. Schrift. des Aristot. pp. 31, 158, 187: “Cicero, dessen
Unbekanntschaft mit beinahe sämmtlichen heute vorhandenen Werken des
Aristoteles eine unstreitige Thatsache bildet, deren Bedeutung man sich
umsonst bemüht hat abzuschwächen.” Madvig, Excursus VII. ad Ciceron. De
Finibus, p. 855: “Non dubito profiteri, Ciceronem mihi videri dialogos
Aristotelis populariter scriptos, et Rhetorica (quibus hic Topica
adnumero) tum &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; legisse; difficiliora vero, quibus omnis
interior philosophia continebatur, aut omnino non attigisse, aut si
aliquando attigerit, non longe progressum esse, ut ipse de subtilioribus
 Aristotelis sententiis aliquid habere possit explorati.” The language
here used by Madvig is more precise than that of the other two; for
Cicero must be allowed to have known, and even to have had in his
library, the Topica of Aristotle.</p></div>

 See this point enforced by Heitz, pp. 29-31. Athenæus (xiv. 656) refers
 to a passage of Philochorus, in which Philochorus alludes to Aristotle,
 that is, as critics have hitherto supposed, to Aristot. Meteorol. iv.
3, 21. Bussemaker (in his Præfat. ad Aristot. Didot, vol. iv. p. xix.)
has shewn that this supposition is unfounded, and that the passage more
probably refers to one of the Problemata Inedita (iii. 43) which
Bussemaker has first published in Didot’s edition of Aristotle.</p></div>
<p>
Here, then, we find several embarrassing facts in regard to the
Aristotelian Canon. Most of the works now accepted and known as
belonging to Aristotle, are neither included in the full Aristotelian
Catalogue given by Diogenes, nor were they known to Cicero; who,
moreover, ascribes to Aristotle attributes of style not only different,
but opposite, to those which <i>our</i> Aristotle presents. Besides, more than twenty of the compositions entered in the Catalogue are dialogues, of which form <i>our</i>
 Aristotle affords not a single specimen: while others relate to matters
 of ancient exploit or personal history; collected proverbs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
 accounts of the actual constitution of many Hellenic cities; lists of
the Pythian victors and of the scenic representations; erotic
discourses; legendary narratives, embodied in a miscellaneous work
called ‘Peplus’ — a title perhaps borrowed from the <i>Peplus</i> or
robe of Athênê at the Panathenaic festival, embroidered with various
figures by Athenian women; a symposion or banquet-colloquy; and remarks
on intoxication. All these subjects are foreign in character to those
which <i>our</i> Aristotle treats.<a name="FnAnchor2_13" href="#Footnote2_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_13" id="Footnote2_13"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_13">13</a></span>
 Brandis and Zeller, moreover, remark, that among the allusions made by
Aristotle in the works which we possess to other works of his own, the
majority relate to other works actually extant, and very few to any of
the lost works enumerated in the Catalogue (Brand. Aristoteles, pp.
97-101; Zeller, Phil. der Griech. ii. 2, p. 79, ed. 2nd). This however
is not always the case: we find (<i>e.g.</i>) in Aristotle’s notice of
the Pythagorean tenets (Metaphys. A. p. 986, a. 12) the remark,
&#948;&#953;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;; where he probably
 means to indicate his special treatises, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#928;&#965;&#952;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#957; and &#928;&#961;&#8056;&#962;
&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#928;&#965;&#952;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;, enumerated by Diog. L. v. 25, and mentioned by
Alexander, Porphyry, and Simplikius. See Alexander, Schol. ad Metaphys.

<p>
The difficulty of harmonizing <i>our</i> Aristotle with the Aristotle of
 the Catalogue is thus considerable. It has been so strongly felt in
recent years, that one of the ablest modern critics altogether dissevers
 the two, and pronounces the works enumerated in the Catalogue not to
belong to <i>our</i> Aristotle. I allude to Valentine Rose, who in his very learned and instructive volume, ‘<i>Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus</i>,’
 has collected and illustrated the fragments which remain of these
works. He considers them all pseudo-Aristotelian, composed by various
unknown members of the Peripatetic school, during the century or two
immediately succeeding the death of Aristotle, and inscribed with the
illustrious name of the master, partly through fraud of the sellers,
partly through carelessness of purchasers and librarians.<a name="FnAnchor2_14" href="#Footnote2_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
 Emil Heitz, on the other hand, has argued more recently, that upon the
external evidence as it stands, a more correct conclusion to draw would
be (the opposite of that drawn by Rose, viz.): That the works enumerated
 in the Catalogue are the true and genuine; and that those which we
possess, or most of them, are not really composed by Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchor2_15" href="#Footnote2_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 Heitz thinks this conclusion better sustained than that of Rose, though
 he himself takes a different view, which I shall presently mention.</p>

<p>
It will be seen from the foregoing observations how much more difficult it is to settle a genuine Canon for Aristotle than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>for
 Plato. I do not assent to either of the two conclusions just indicated;
 but I contend that, if we applied to this question the same principles
of judgment as those which modern Platonic critics often apply, when
they allow or disallow dialogues of Plato, we should be obliged to
embrace one or other of them, or at least something nearly approaching
thereto. If a critic, after attentively studying the principal
compositions now extant of <i>our</i> Aristotle, thinks himself entitled, on the faith of his acquired “<i>Aristotelisches Gefühl</i>,”
 to declare that no works differing materially from them (either in
subject handled, or in manner of handling, or in degree of excellence),
can have been composed by Aristotle — he will assuredly be forced to
include in such rejection a large proportion of those indicated in the
Catalogue of Diogenes. Especially he will be forced to reject the
Dialogues — the very compositions by which Aristotle was best known to
Cicero and his contemporaries. For the difference between them and the
known compositions of Aristotle, not merely in form but in style (the
style being known from the epithets applied to them by Cicero), must
have been more marked and decisive than that between the Alkibiades,
Hippias, Theages, Erastæ, Leges, &amp;c. — which most Platonic critics
now set aside as spurious — and the Republic, Protagoras, Gorgias,
Philêbus, &amp;c., which they treat as indisputably genuine.<a name="FnAnchor2_16" href="#Footnote2_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_16" id="Footnote2_16"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_16">16</a></span>
 Thus (for example) in Bernays, who has displayed great acuteness and
learning in investigating the Aristotelian Canon, and in collecting what
 can be known respecting the lost dialogues of Aristotle, we read the
following observations:— “In der That mangelt es auch nicht an den
bestimmtesten Nachrichten über die vormalige Existenz einer grossen
aristotelischen Schriftenreihe, die von der jetzt erhaltenen <i>durch die tiefste formale Verschiedenheit</i>
 getrennt war. Das Verzeichniss aristotelischer Werke führt an seiner
Spitze sieben und zwanzig Bände jetzt verlorener Schriften auf, die alle
 in der künstlerischen Gesprächsform abgefasst waren,” &amp;c. (Bernays,
 Die Dialoge des Aristoteles, p. 2; compare ibid. p. 30).</p>
<p>
If, as Bernays justly contends, we are to admit these various writings,
notwithstanding “the profound difference of form,” as having emanated
from the same philosopher Aristotle, how are we to trust the Platonic
critics when they reject about one-third of the preserved dialogues of
Plato, though there is no difference of form to proceed upon, but only a
 difference of style, merit, and, to a certain extent, doctrine?</p>
<p>
Zeller (Die Phil. der Griechen, ii. 2, pp. 45, 46, 2nd ed.) remarks that
 the dialogues composed by Aristotle are probably to be ascribed to the
earlier part of his literary life, when he was still (or had recently
been) Plato’s scholar.</p></div>
<p>
In discussing the Platonic Canon, I have already declared that I
consider these grounds of rejection to be unsafe and misleading. Such
judgment is farther confirmed, when we observe the consequences to which
 they would conduct in regard to the Aristotelian Canon. In fact, we
must learn to admit among genuine works, both of Plato and Aristotle,
great diversity in subject, in style, and in excellence. </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>I see no
 ground for distrusting the Catalogue given by Diogenes, as being in
general an enumeration of works really composed by Aristotle. These
works must have been lodged in some great library — probably the
Alexandrine — where they were seen and counted, and the titles of them
enrolled by some one or more among the <i>literati</i>, with a specification of the sum total obtained on adding together the lines contained in each.<a name="FnAnchor2_17" href="#Footnote2_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 I do not deny the probability, that, in regard to some, the librarians
may have been imposed upon, and that pseudo-Aristotelian works may have
been admitted; but whether such was partially the fact or not, the
general goodness of the Catalogue seems to me unimpeachable. As to the
author of it, the most admissible conjecture seems that of Brandis and
others, recently adopted and advocated by Heitz: that the Catalogue owes
 its origin to one of the Alexandrine <i>literati</i>; probably to Hermippus of Smyrna, a lettered man and a pupil of Kallimachus at Alexandria, between 240-210 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>.
 Diogenes does not indeed tell us from whom he borrowed the Catalogue;
but in his life of Aristotle, he more than once cites Hermippus, as
having treated of Aristotle and his biography in a work of some extent;
and we know from other sources that Hermippus had devoted much attention
 to Aristotle as well as to other philosophers. If Hermippus be the
author of this Catalogue, it must have been drawn up about the same time
 that the Byzantine Aristophanes arranged the dialogues of Plato.
Probably, indeed, Kallimachus the chief librarian, had prepared the way
for both of them. We know that he had drawn up comprehensive tables,
including, not only the principal orators and dramatists, with an
enumeration of their discourses and dramas, but also various
miscellaneous authors, with the titles of their works. We know, farther,
 that he noticed Demokritus and Eudoxus, and we may feel assured that,
in a scheme thus large, he would not omit Plato or Aristotle, the two
great founders of the first philosophical schools, nor the specification
 of the works of each contained in the Alexandrine library.<a name="FnAnchor2_18" href="#Footnote2_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Heitz supposes that Hermippus was the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>author of most of the catalogues (not merely of Aristotle, but also of other philosophers) given by Diogenes;<a name="FnAnchor2_19" href="#Footnote2_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 yet that nevertheless Diogenes himself had no direct acquaintance with
the works of Hermippus, but copied these catalogues at second-hand from
some later author, probably Favorinus. This last supposition is noway
made out. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_17" id="Footnote2_17"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_17">17</a></span>
 Stahr, who in the first volume of his work Aristotelia (p. 194), had
expressed an opinion that the Catalogue given by Diogenes is the
Catalogue “der eigenen Schritten des Stageiriten, wie sie sich in seinem
 Nachlasse befanden,” retracts that opinion in the second volume of the
same work (pp. 68-70), and declares the Catalogue to be an enumeration
of the Aristotelian works in the library of Alexandria. Trendelenburg
concurs in this later opinion (Proœmium ad Commentar. in Aristot. De
Animâ, p. 123).</p></div>

<p>
Among the Tables prepared by Kallimachus, one was &#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#948;&#940;&#960;&#969;&#957;
&#931;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#928;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#958;; and in it were included the &#928;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#953;&#776;&#954;&#8048;
&#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#913;&#7984;&#947;&#953;&#956;&#943;&#959;&#965;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7977;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#965;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#924;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#943;&#959;&#965;, &#7956;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#934;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#965;
(Athenæus, xiv. 644). If Kallimachus carried down his catalogue of the
contents of the library to works so unimportant as these, we may surely
believe that he would not omit to catalogue such works of Aristotle as
were in it. He appears to have made a list of the works of Demokritus (<i>i.e.</i> such as were in the library) with a glossary. See Brandis (Aristoteles, Berlin, 1853, p. 74); also Suidas <i>v.</i> &#922;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#943;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#962;, Diogen. Laert. viii. 86; Dionys. Hal.

<p>
Patricius, in his Discuss. Peripatetic. (t. i. pp. 13-18), had
previously considered Hermippus as having prepared a Catalogue of the
works of Aristotle, partly on the authority of the Scholion annexed to
the conclusion of the Metaphysica of Theophrastus. Hermippus recited the
 testament of Aristotle (Athenæus, xiii. 589). </p>
<p>
Both Valentine Rose and Bernays regard Andronikus as author of the
Catalogue of Aristotle in Diogenes. But I think that very sufficient
reasons to refute this supposition have been shown by Heitz, pp. 49-52.</p>

<p>The opinion given by Christ, respecting the Catalogue which we find
in Diogenes Laertius — “illum catalogum non Alexandrinæ bibliothecæ, sed
 exemplarium Aristotelis ab Apelliconte Athenas translatorum fuisse
equidem censeo” — is in substance the same as that of Rose and Bernays. I
 do not concur in it. (Christ, Studia in Aristotelis Libros
Metaphysicos, Berlin, 1853, p. 105).</p></div>
<p>
It seems thus probable that the Catalogue given by Diogenes derives its
origin from Hermippus or Kallimachus, enumerating the titles of such
works of Aristotle as were contained in the Alexandrine library. But the
 aggregate of works composing <i>our</i> Aristotle is noway in harmony
with that Catalogue. It proceeds from a source independent and totally
different, viz., the edition and classification first published by the
Rhodian Andronikus, in the generation between the death of Cicero and
the Christian era. To explain the existence of these two distinct and
independent sources and channels, we must have recourse to the
remarkable narrative (already noticed in my <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_6_8">chapter</a>
 on the Platonic Canon), delivered mainly by Strabo and less fully by
Plutarch, respecting the fate of the Aristotelian library after
Aristotle’s death. </p>
<p>
At the decease of Aristotle, his library and MSS. came to Theophrastus,
who continued chief of the Peripatetic school at Athens for thirty-five
years, until his death in 287 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Both
Aristotle and Theophrastus not only composed many works of their own,
but also laid out much money in purchasing or copying the works of
others;<a name="FnAnchor2_20" href="#Footnote2_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
 especially we are told that Aristotle, after the death of Speusippus,
expended three talents in purchasing his books. The entire library of
Theophrastus, thus enriched from two sources, was bequeathed by his
testament <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span> to a philosophical friend and pupil, Neleus;<a name="FnAnchor2_21" href="#Footnote2_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 who left Athens, and carried away the library with him to his residence
 at the town of Skêpsis, in the Asiatic region known as Æolis, near
Troad. At Skêpsis the library remained for the greater part of two
centuries, in possession of the descendants of Neleus, men of no
accomplishments and no taste for philosophy. It was about thirty or
forty years after the death of Theophrastus that the kings of Pergamus
began to occupy themselves in collecting their royal library, which
presently reached a magnitude second only to that of Alexandria. Now
Skêpsis was under their dominion, and it would seem that the kings
seized the books belonging to their subjects for the use of the royal
library; for we are told that the heirs of Neleus were forced to conceal
 their literary treasures in a cellar, subject to great injury, partly
from damp, partly from worms. In this ruinous hiding-place the
manuscripts remained for nearly a century and a half — “<i>blattarum ac tinearum epulæ</i>,” — until the Attalid dynasty at Pergamus became extinct. The last of these kings, Attalus, died in 133 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 bequeathing his kingdom to the Romans. All fear of requisitions for the
 royal library being thus at end, the manuscripts were in course of time
 withdrawn by their proprietors from concealment, and sold for a large
sum to Apellikon, a native of Teos, a very rich resident at Athens, and
attached to the Peripatetic sect. Probably this wealthy Peripatetic
already possessed a library of his own, with some Aristotelian works;
but the new acquisitions from Skêpsis, though not his whole stock,
formed the most rare and precious ingredients in it. Here, then, the
manuscripts and library both of Aristotle and Theophrastus became, for
the first time since 287 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, open to the inspection of the Athenian Peripatetics of the time (about 100 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), as well as of other learned men. Among the stock were contained many compositions which the Scholarchs, successors of <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Theopharstus'">Theophrastus</span> at Athens, had neither possessed nor known.<a name="FnAnchor2_22" href="#Footnote2_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> But the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>manuscripts
 were found imperfect, seriously damaged, and in a state of disorder.
Apellikon did his best to remedy that mischief, by causing new copies to
 be taken, correcting what had become worm-eaten, and supplying what was
 defective or illegible. He appears to have been an erudite man, and had
 published a biography of Aristotle, refuting various calumnies advanced
 by other biographers; but being (in the words of Strabo) a lover of
books rather than a philosopher, he performed the work of correction so
unskilfully, that the copies which he published were found full of
errors.<a name="FnAnchor2_23" href="#Footnote2_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> In the year 86 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
 Sylla besieged Athens, and captured it by storm; not long after which
he took to himself as a perquisite the library of Apellikon, and
transported it to Rome.<a name="FnAnchor2_24" href="#Footnote2_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 It was there preserved under custody of a librarian, and various
literary Greeks resident at Rome obtained access to it, especially
Tyrannion, the friend of Cicero and a warm admirer of Aristotle, who
took peculiar pains to gain the favour of the librarian.<a name="FnAnchor2_25" href="#Footnote2_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> It was there also that the Rhodian Andronikus obtained access to the Aristotelian works.<a name="FnAnchor2_26" href="#Footnote2_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> He classified them to a great degree anew, putting in juxtaposition the treatises most analogous in subject;<a name="FnAnchor2_27" href="#Footnote2_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> moreover, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>he
 corrected the text, and published a new edition of the manuscripts,
with a tabulated list. This was all the more necessary, because some
booksellers at Rome, aiming only at sale and profit, had employed bad
writers, and circulated inaccurate copies, not collated with the
originals.<a name="FnAnchor2_28" href="#Footnote2_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 These originals, however, were so damaged, and the restitutions made by
 Apellikon were so injudicious, that the more careful critics who now
studied them were often driven to proceed on mere probable evidence. </p>

 Strabo, xiii. 608, 609; Athenæus, v. 214. The narrative of Strabo has
been often misunderstood and impugned, as if he had asserted that none
of the main works of Aristotle had ever been published until they were
thus exhumed by Apellikon. This is the supposed allegation which Stahr,
Zeller, and others have taken so much pains to refute. But in reality
Strabo says no such thing. His words affirm or imply the direct
contrary, viz., that many works of Aristotle, not merely the exoteric
works but others besides, <i>had</i> been published earlier than the
purchase made by Apellikon. What Strabo says is, that few of these works
 were in possession of the Peripatetic Scholarchs at Athens before the
time of that purchase; and he explains thus how it was that these
Scholarchs, during the century intervening, had paid little attention to
 the profound and abstruse speculations of Aristotle; how it was that
they had confined themselves to dialectic and rhetorical debate on
special problems. I see no ground for calling in question the fact
affirmed by Strabo — the poverty of the Peripatetic school-library at
Athens; though he may perhaps have assigned a greater importance to that
 fact than it deserves, as a means of explaining the intellectual
working of the Peripatetic Scholarchs from Lykon to Kritolaus. The
philosophical impulse of that intervening century seems to have turned
chiefly towards ethics and the <i>Summum Bonum</i>, with the conflicting theories of Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, and Epikureans thereupon.</p></div>

 The testimony of Porphyry in respect to Andronikus, and to the real
service performed by Andronikus, is highly valuable. Porphyry was the
devoted disciple and friend, as well as the literary executor, of
Plotinus; whose writings were left in an incorrect and disorderly
condition. Porphyry undertook to put them in order and publish them; and
 he tells us that, in fulfilling this promise, he followed the example
of what Andronikus had done for the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus.

(Porphyry, Vita Plotini, p. 117, Didot.) Porphyry here distinctly
affirms that Andronikus rendered this valuable service not merely to the
 works of Aristotle, but also to those of Theophrastus. This is
important, as connecting him with the library conveyed by Sylla to Rome;
 which library we know to have contained the manuscripts of both these
philosophers. And in the Scholion appended to the Metaphysica of
Theophrastus (p. 323, Brandis) we are told that Andronikus and Hermippus
 had made a catalogue of the works of Theophrastus, in which the
Metaphysics was not included.</p></div>

<p>
This interesting narrative — delivered by Strabo, the junior
contemporary of Andronikus, and probably derived by him either from
Tyrannion his preceptor or from the Sidonian Boêthus<a name="FnAnchor2_29" href="#Footnote2_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 and other philosophical companions jointly, with whom he had prosecuted
 the study of Aristotle — appears fully worthy of trust. The proceedings
 both of Apellikon and of Sylla prove, what indeed we might have
presumed without proof, that the recovery of these long-lost original
manuscripts of Aristotle and Theophrastus excited great sensation in the
 philosophical world of Athens and of Rome. With such newly-acquired
materials, a new epoch began for the study of these authors. The more
abstruse philosophical works of Aristotle now came into the foreground
under the auspices of a new Scholarch; whereas Aristotle had hitherto
been chiefly known by his more popular and readable compositions. Of
these last, probably, copies may have been acquired to a certain extent
by the previous Peripatetic Scholarchs or School at Athens; but the
School had been irreparably impoverished, so far as regarded the deeper
speculations of philosophy, by the loss of those original manuscripts
which had been transported from Athens to Skêpsis. What Aristotelian
Scholarchs, prior to Andronikus, chiefly possessed and studied, of the
productions of their illustrious founder, were chiefly the <i>exoteric</i> or extra-philosophical and comparatively popular:— such as the dialogues; the legendary and historical <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>collections;
 the facts respecting constitutional history of various Hellenic cities;
 the variety of miscellaneous problems respecting Homer and a number of
diverse matters; the treatises on animals and on anatomy, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchor2_30" href="#Footnote2_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
 In the Alexandrine library (as we see by the Catalogue of Diogenes)
there existed all these and several philosophical works also; but that
library was not easily available for the use of the Scholarchs at
Athens, who worked upon their own stock, confining themselves mainly to
smooth and elegant discourses on particular questions, and especially to
 discussions, with the Platonists, Stoics, and Epikureans, on the <i>principia</i>
 of Ethics, without any attempt either to follow up or to elucidate the
more profound speculations (logical, physical, metaphysical, cosmical)
of Aristotle himself. A material change took place when the library of
Apellikon came to be laid open and studied, not merely by lecturers in
the professorial chair at Athens, but also by critics like Tyrannion and
 Andronikus at Rome. These critics found therein the most profound and
difficult philosophical works of Aristotle in the handwriting of the
philosopher himself; some probably, of which copies may have already
existed in the Alexandrine library, but some also as yet unpublished.
The purpose of Andronikus, who is described as Peripatetic Scholarch,
eleventh in succession from Aristotle, was not simply to make a
Catalogue (as Hermippus had made at Alexandria), but to render a much
greater service, which no critic could render without having access to
original MSS., namely, to obtain a correct text of the books actually
before him, to arrange these books in proper order, and then to publish
and explain them,<a name="FnAnchor2_31" href="#Footnote2_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> but to take no account of other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>Aristotelian
 works in the Alexandrine library or elsewhere. The Aristotelian
philosophy thus passed into a new phase. Our editions of Aristotle may
be considered as taking their date from this critical effort of
Andronikus, with or without subsequent modifications by others, as the
case may be. </p>

 Strabo, xvi. 757. Stahr, in his minor work, Aristoteles unter den

of Strabo. I think the contrary. No one was so likely to have studied
the previous history of the MSS. as the editors of a new edition.</p></div>

<p>
The passage of Strabo is so perspicuous and detailed, that it has all
the air of having been derived from the best critics who frequented the
library at Rome, where Strabo was when he wrote (&#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#7956;&#957;&#952;&#945;&#948;&#949;</span>
 &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#7944;&#955;&#949;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#8115;, xiii. 609). The Peripatetic Andronikus, whom he
names among the celebrated Rhodians (xiv. 655), may have been among his
informants. His statements about the bad state of the manuscripts; the
unskilful emendations of Apellikon; the contrast between the vein of
Peripatetic study, as it had stood before the revelation of the
manuscripts, and as it came to stand afterwards; the uncertain evidences
 upon which careful students, even with the manuscripts before them,
were compelled to proceed; the tone of depreciation in which he speaks
of the carelessness of booksellers who sought only for profit, — all
these points of information appear to me to indicate that Strabo’s
informants were acute and diligent critics, familiar with the library,
and anxious both for the real understanding of these documents, and for
philosophy as an end.</p></div>

 Plutarch, Sylla, c. xxvi. Spengel (“Ueber die Reihenfolge der
naturwissenschaftlichen Schriften des Aristoteles,” München. philol.
Abhandl. 1848,) remarks justly that the critical arrangement of
Aristotle’s writings, for collective publication, begins from the
library of Apellikon at Rome, not from that of Alexandria. See p. 146:
“Mehr als zweihundert Jahre lang fehlt uns alle nähere Kunde über die
peripatetische Schule. Erst mit der viel besprochenen Auffindung der
Bibliothek des Aristoteles in Athen und deren Wegführung nach Rom durch
Sulla wird ein regeres Studium für die Schriften des Philosophen
bemerkbar — <i>und zwar jetzt eigentlich der Schriften, weniger der
Lehre und Philosophie im Allgemeinen, welche früher allein beachtet
worden ist</i>. Wir möchten sagen, von jetzt an beginne das
philologische Studium mit den Werken des Aristoteles, die kritische und
exegetische Behandlung dieser durch Tyrannion, Andronikus, Adrastus und
viele andre nachlfolgende,” &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
The explanation just given, coinciding on many points with Brandis and
Heitz, affords the most probable elucidation of that obscurity which
arises about the Aristotelian Canon, when we compare <i>our</i>
Aristotle with the Catalogue of Diogenes — the partial likeness, but
still greater discrepancy, between the two. It is certain that neither
Cicero<a name="FnAnchor2_32" href="#Footnote2_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> nor the great Alexandrine <i>literati</i>,
 anterior to and contemporary with him, knew Aristotle from most of the
works which we now possess. They knew him chiefly from the dialogues,
the matters of history and legend, some zoological books, and the
problems; the dialogues, and the historical collections respecting the
constitutions of Hellenic cities,<a name="FnAnchor2_33" href="#Footnote2_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> being more popular and better known than any other works. While the Republic of Plato is familiar to them, they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>exhibit
 no knowledge of our Aristotelian Politica, in which treatise the
criticism upon the Platonic Republic is among the most interesting
parts. When we look through the contents of our editions of Aristotle
the style and manner of handling is indeed pretty much the same
throughout, but the subjects will appear extremely diverse and
multifarious; and the encyclopedical character of the author, as to
science and its applications, will strike us forcibly. The entire and
real Aristotle, however, was not only more encyclopedical as to subjects
 handled, but also more variable as to style and manner of handling;
passing from the smooth, sweet, and flowing style — which Cicero extols
as characterizing the Aristotelian dialogues — to the elliptical brevity
 and obscurity which we now find so puzzling in the De Animâ and the
Metaphysica.<a name="FnAnchor2_34" href="#Footnote2_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_32" id="Footnote2_32"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_32">32</a></span>
 This is certain, from the remarks addressed by Cicero to Trebatius at
the beginning of the Ciceronian Topica, that in his time Aristotle was
little known and little studied at Rome, even by philosophical students.
 Trebatius knew nothing of the Topica, until he saw the work by chance
in Cicero’s library, and asked information about the contents. The reply
 of Cicero illustrates the little notice taken of Aristotle by Roman
readers. “Cum autem ego te, non tam vitandi laboris mei causâ, quam quia
 tua id interesse arbitrarer, vel ut eos per te ipse legeres, vel ut
totam rationem a doctissimo quodam rhetore acciperes, hortatus essem,
utrumque ut ex te audiebam, es expertus. Sed a libris te obscuritas
rejecit: rhetor autem ille magnus, ut opinor, <i>Aristotelia se ignorare</i> respondit. Quod quidem minime sum admiratus, eum philosophum rhetori non esse cognitum, <i>qui ab ipsis philosophis, præter admodum paucos, ignoraretur.</i>” Compare also Cicero, Academ. Post. i. 3, 10.</p></div>

 Even the philosophical commentators on Aristotle, such as David the
Armenian, seem to have known the lost work of Aristotle called &#928;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;
 (the history of the constitutions of 250 Hellenic cities), better than
the theoretical work which we possess, called the Politica; though they
doubtless knew both. (See Scholia ad Categorias, Brandis, p. 16, b. 20;
p. 24, a. 25; p. 25, b. 5.) — We read in Schneider’s Preface to the
Aristotelian Politica (p. x.): “Altum et mirabile silentium est apud
antiquitatem Græcam et Romanam de novâ Aristotelis Republicâ, cum omnes
ferè scriptores Græci et Romani, mentione Reipublicæ Platonicæ pleni,
vel laudibus vel vituperiis ejus abundant.” — There is no clear
reference to the Aristotelian Politica earlier than Alexander of
Aphrodisias. Both Hildenbrand (Geschichte der Staats- und
Rechts-Philosophen, t. i. pp. 358-361), and Oncken (Staatslehre des
Aristot. pp. 65-66), think that the Aristotelian Politica was not
published until after the purchase of the library by Apellikon.</p></div>

 What Strabo asserts about the Peripatetic Scholarchs succeeding
Theophrastus (viz., &#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;
&#955;&#951;&#954;&#965;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;: that they could not handle philosophy in a businesslike way —
 with those high generalities and that subtle analysis which was
supposed to belong to philosophy — but gave smooth and ornate discourses
 on set problems or theses) is fully borne out by what we read in Cicero
 about these same Peripatetics. The Stoics (immediate successors and
rivals) accused their Peripatetic contemporaries even of being ignorant
of Dialectic: which their founder, Aristotle, in his works that we now
possess, had been the first to raise into something like a science.
Cicero says (De Finibus, iii. 12, 41): “His igitur ita positis (inquit
Cato) sequitur magna contentio: quam tractatam à Peripateticis mollius (<i>est enim eorum consuetudo dicendi non satis acuta, propter ignorationem Dialecticæ</i>),
 Carneades tuus, egregiâ quâdam exercitatione in dialecticis summâque
eloquentiâ, rem in summum discrimen adduxit.” Also Cicero, in Tuscul.
Disput. iv. 5. 9: “Quia Chrysippus et Stoici, quum de animi
perturbationibus disputant, magnam partem in iis partiendis et
definiendis occupati sunt, illa eorum perexigua oratio est, quâ
medeantur animis nec eos turbulentos esse patiantur. Peripatetici autem <i>ad placandos animos multa afferunt, spinas partiendi et definiendi prætermittunt</i>.”
 This last sentence is almost an exact equivalent of the words of
Strabo: &#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#955;&#951;&#954;&#965;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;.
Aristotle himself, in the works which we possess, might pass as father
of the Stoics rather than of the Peripatetics; for he abounds in
classification and subdivision (spinas partiendi et dividendi), and is
even derided on this very ground by opponents (see Atticus ap. Euseb.
Præp. Ev. xv. 4); but he has nothing of the polished amplification
ascribed to the later Peripatetics by Strabo and Cicero. Compare, about
the Peripatetics from Lykon to Kritolaus, Cicero, De Finibus, v. 5:
“Lyco, oratione locuples, rebus ipsis jejunior.” Plutarch (Sylla, c.
xxvi.) calls these later Peripatetics &#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953;, &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
I shall assume this variety, both of subject and of handling, as a
feature to be admitted and allowed for in Aristotle, when I come to
discuss the objections of some critics against the authenticity of
certain treatises among the forty-six which now pass under his name. But
 in canvassing the Aristotelian Canon I am unable to take the same
ground as I took in my former work, when reviewing the Platonic Canon.
In regard to Plato, I pointed out a strong antecedent presumption in
favour of the Canon of Thrasyllus — a canon derived originally from the
Alexandrine librarians, and sustained by the unanimous adhesion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
 of antiquity. In regard to Aristotle, there are no similar grounds of
presumption to stand upon. We have good reason for believing that the
works both of Plato and Aristotle — if not all the works, at least many
of them, and those the most generally interesting — were copied and
transmitted early to the Alexandrine library. Now <i>our</i> Plato
represents that which was possessed and accredited as Platonic by the
Byzantine Aristophanes and the other Alexandrine librarians; but <i>our</i>
 Aristotle does not, in my judgment, represent what these librarians
possessed and accredited as Aristotelian. That which they thus
accredited stands recorded in the Catalogue given by Diogenes, probably
the work of Hermippus, as I have already stated; while <i>our</i>
Aristotle is traceable to the collection at Athens, including that of
Apellikon, with that which he bought from the heirs of Neleus, and to
the sifting, correction, and classification, applied thereto by able
critics of the first century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and
subsequently; among whom Andronikus is best known. We may easily believe
 that the library of Apellikon contained various compositions of
Aristotle, which had never been copied for the Alexandrine library —
perhaps never prepared for publication at all, so that the task of
arranging detached sections or morsels into a whole, with one separate
title, still remained to be performed. This was most likely to be the
case with abstruser speculations, like the component books of the
Metaphysica, which Theophrastus may not have been forward to tender, and
 which the library might not be very eager to acquire, having already
near four hundred other volumes by the same author. These reserved works
 would therefore remain in the library of Theophrastus, not copied and
circulated (or at least circulated only to a few private philosophical
brethren, such as Eudêmus), so that they never became fully published
until the days of Apellikon.<a name="FnAnchor2_35" href="#Footnote2_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_35" id="Footnote2_35"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_35">35</a></span>
 The two Peripatetic Scholarchs at Athens, Straton and Lykon, who
succeeded (after the death of Theophrastus and the transfer of his
library to Skêpsis) in the conduct of the school, left at their decease
collections of books, of which each disposes by his will (Diogen. L. v.
62; v. 73). The library of Apellikon, when sent by Sylla to Rome,
contained probably many other Aristotelian MSS., besides those purchased
 from Skêpsis. </p>
<p>
Michelet, in his Commentary on the Nikomachean Ethica, advances a theory
 somewhat analogous but bolder, respecting the relation between the
Catalogue given by Diogenes, and the works contained in <i>our</i>
Aristotle. Comm. p. 2. “Id solum addam, hoc Aristotelis opus (the
Nikomachean Ethica), ut reliqua omnia, ex brevioribus commentationibus
consarcinatum fuisse, quæ quidem vivo Aristotele in lucem prodierint,
cum unaquæque disciplina, e quâ excerpta fuerint in admirabilem illum
quem habemus ordinem jam ab ipso Aristotele sive quodam ejus discipulo
redacta, in libris Aristotelis manu scriptis latitaverit, qui hereditate
 ad Nelei prolem, ut notum est, transmissi, in cellâ illâ subterraneâ
Scepsiâ absconditi fuerunt, donec Apellicon Teius et Rhodius Andronicus
eos ediderint. Leguntur autem commentationum illarum de Moribus tituli
in elencho librorum Aristotelis apud Diogenem (v. 22-26): &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8182;&#957;
(Lib. ii., iii. c. 6-fin. iv. nostrorum Ethicorum); &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7953;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#965; (Lib.
iii. c. 1-5); &amp;c. Plerumque enim non integra volumina, sed singulos
libros vel singula volumina diversarum disciplinarum, Diogenes in
elencho suo enumeravit.”</p>
<p>
In his other work (Essai sur la Métaphysique d’Aristote, pp. 202, 205,
225) Michelet has carried this theory still farther, and has endeavoured
 to identify separate fragments of the Aristotelian works now extant,
with various titles in the Catalogue given by Diogenes. The
identification is not convincing.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>But
though the edition published by Andronikus would thus contain many
genuine works of Aristotle not previously known or edited, we cannot be
sure that it would not also include some which were spurious. Reflect
what the library of Apellikon, transported to Rome by Sylla, really was.
 There was in it the entire library of Theophrastus; probably, also,
that of Neleus, who must have had some books of his own, besides what he
 inherited from Theophrastus. It included all the numerous manuscript
works composed by Aristotle and Theophrastus, and many other manuscript
works purchased or acquired by them, but composed by others — the whole
in very bad order and condition; and, moreover, the books which
Apellikon possessed before, doubtless as many Aristotelian books as he
could purchase. To distinguish, among this heterogeneous mass of
manuscripts, which of them were the manuscripts composed by Aristotle;
to separate these from the writings of Theophrastus, Eudêmus, or other
authors, who composed various works of their own upon the same subjects
and with the same titles as those of Aristotle — required extreme
critical discernment and caution; the rather, since there was no living
companion of Aristotle or Theophrastus to guide or advise, more than a
century and a half having elapsed since the death of Theophrastus, and
two centuries since that of Aristotle. Such were the difficulties amidst
 which Apellikon, Tyrannion, and Andronikus had to decide, when they
singled out the manuscripts of Aristotle to be published. I will not say
 that they decided wrongly; yet neither can I contend (as I argued in
the case of the Platonic dialogues) that the presumption is very
powerful in favour of that Canon which their decision made legal. The
case is much more open to argument, if any grounds against the decision
can be urged.</p>
<p>
Andronikus put in, arranged, and published the treatises of Aristotle
(or those which he regarded as composed by Aristotle) included in the
library conveyed by Sylla to Rome. I have already observed, that among
these treatises there were some, of which copies existed in the
Alexandrine library (as represented <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>by
 the Catalogue of Diogenes), but a still greater number which cannot be
identified with the titles remaining of works there preserved. As to the
 works common to both libraries, we must remember that Andronikus
introduced a classification of his own, analogous to the Enneads applied
 by Porphyry to the works of Plotinus, and to the Tetralogies adopted by
 Thrasyllus in regard to the Dialogues of Plato; so that even these
works might not be distributed in the same partitions under each of the
two arrangements. And this is what we actually see when we compare the
Catalogue of Diogenes with <i>our</i> Aristotle. Rhetoric, Ethics,
Physics, Problems, &amp;c., appear in both as titles or subjects, but
distributed into a different number of books or sections in one and in
the other; perhaps, indeed, the compositions are not always the same. </p>
<p>
Before I proceed to deal with the preserved works of Aristotle — those
by which alone he is known to us, and was known to mediæval readers, I
shall say a few words respecting the import of a distinction which has
been much canvassed, conveyed in the word <i>exoteric</i> and its
opposite. This term, used on various occasions by Aristotle himself, has
 been also employed by many ancient critics, from Cicero downwards;
while by mediæval and modern critics, it has not merely been employed,
but also analysed and elucidated. According to Cicero (the earliest
writer subsequent to Aristotle in whom we find the term), it designates
one among two classes of works composed by Aristotle: <i>exoteric</i>
works were those composed in a popular style and intended for a large,
indiscriminate circle of readers: being contrasted with other works of
elaborated philosophical reasoning, which were not prepared for the
public taste, but left in the condition of memorials for the instruction
 of a more select class of studious men. Two points are to be observed
respecting Cicero’s declaration. First, he applies it to the writings
not of Aristotle exclusively, but also to those of Theophrastus, and
even of succeeding Peripatetics; secondly, he applies it directly to
such of their writings only as related to the discussion of the <i>Summum Bonum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor2_36" href="#Footnote2_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Furthermore, Cicero describes the works <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>which Aristotle called exoteric, as having <i>proems</i> or introductory prefaces.<a name="FnAnchor2_37" href="#Footnote2_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_36" id="Footnote2_36"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_36">36</a></span>
 Cicero, De Finibus, v. 5, 12. “De summo autem bono, quia duo genera
librorum sunt, unum populariter scriptum, quod &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; appellabant,
alterum limatius, quod in commentariis reliquerunt, non semper idem
dicere videntur: nec in summâ tamen ipsâ aut varietas est ulla, apud hos
 quidem quos nominavi, aut inter ipsos dissensio.”</p>
<p>
The word <i>limatius</i> here cannot allude to high polish and ornament of style (nitor orationis), but must be equivalent to &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, <i>doctius</i>, <i>subtilius</i>,
 &amp;c. (as Buhle and others have already remarked, Buhle, De Libris
Aristot. Exoter. et Acroam. p. 115; Madvig, ad Cicero de Finib. v. 12;
Heitz, p. 134), applied to profound reasoning, with distinctions of
unusual precision, which it required a careful preparatory training to
apprehend. This employment of the word <i>limatius</i> appears to me singular, but it cannot mean anything else here. The <i>commentarii</i>
 are the general heads — plain unadorned statements of facts or
reasoning — which the orator or historian is to employ his genius in
setting forth and decorating, so that it may be heard or read with
pleasure and admiration by a general audience. Cicero, in that
remarkable letter wherein he entreats Lucceius to narrate his (Cicero’s)
 consulship in an historical work, undertakes to compose “commentarios
rerum omnium” as materials for the use of Lucceius (Ep. ad Famil. v. 12.
 10). His expression, “in commentariis reliquerunt,” shows that he
considered the exoteric books to have been prepared by working up some
naked preliminary materials into an ornate and interesting form.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_37" id="Footnote2_37"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_37">37</a></span> Cicero, Ep. ad Att. iv. 16.</p></div>
<p>
In the main, the distinction here drawn by Cicero, understood in a very
general sense, has been accepted by most following critics as intended
by the term <i>exoteric</i>: something addressed to a wide,
indiscriminate circle of general readers or hearers, and intelligible or
 interesting to them without any special study or training — as
contrasted with that which is reserved for a smaller circle of students
assumed to be specially qualified. But among those who agree in this
general admission, many differences have prevailed. Some have thought
that the term was not used by Aristotle to designate any writings either
 of his own or of others, but only in allusion to informal oral
dialogues or debates. Others again, feeling assured that Aristotle
intended by the term to signify some writings of his own, have searched
among the works preserved, as well as among the titles of the works
lost, to discriminate such as the author considered to be exoteric:
though this search has certainly not ended in unanimity; nor do I think
it has been successful. Again, there have not been wanting critics
(among them, Thomas Aquinas and Sepulveda), who assign to the term a
meaning still more vague and undefined; contending that when Aristotle
alludes to “exoteric discourses,” he indicates simply some other
treatise of his own, distinct from that in which the allusion occurs,
without meaning to imply anything respecting its character.<a name="FnAnchor2_38" href="#Footnote2_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_38" id="Footnote2_38"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_38">38</a></span>
 Sepulveda, p. 125 (cited by Bernays, Dialoge des Aristoteles, p. 41):
“Externos sermones sive exotericos solet Aristoteles libros eos
appellare, quicunque sunt extra id opus in quo tunc versatur, ut jure
pontificio periti consueverunt: non enim exoterici sermones seu libri
certo aliquo genere continentur, ut est publicus error.”</p>
<p>
Zeller lends his high authority to an explanation of <i>exoteric</i>
very similar to the above. (Gesch. der Philos. ii. 2, p. 100, seq.:—
”dass unter exoterischen Reden nicht eine eigene Klasse populär
geschriebener Bücher, sondern nur überhaupt solche Erörterungen
verstanden werden, welche nicht in den Bereich der vorliegenden
Untersuchung gehören.”) He discusses the point at some length; but the
very passages which he cites, especially Physica, iv. 10, appear to me
less favourable to his view than to that which I have stated in the
text, according to which the word means <i>dialectic</i> as contrasted with <i>didactic</i>.</p></div>
<p>
To me it appears that this last explanation is untenable, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>and that the term <i>exoteric</i>
 designates matter of a certain character, assignable to some extent by
positive marks, but still more by negative; matter, in part, analogous
to that defined by Cicero and other critics. But to conceive clearly or
fully what its character is, we must turn to Aristotle himself, who is
of course the final authority, wherever he can be found to speak in a
decisive manner. His preserved works afford altogether eight passages
(two of them indeed in the Eudemian Ethics, which, for the present at
least, I shall assume to be his work), wherein the phrase “exoteric
discourses” (&#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;) occurs. Out of these eight passages,
there are seven which present the phrase as designating some unknown
matter, not farther specified, but distinct from the work in which the
phrase occurs: “Enough has been said (or is said, Aristotle intimates)
about this subject, even in the exoteric discourses.” To what it is that
 he here alludes — whether to other writings of his own or oral
discussions of his own, or writing and speech of a particular sort by
others — we are left to interpret as we best may, by probable reason or
conjecture. But there is one among the eight passages, in which
Aristotle uses the term <i>exoteric</i> as describing, not what is to be
 looked for elsewhere, but what he is himself about to give in the
treatise in hand. In the fourth book of the Physica, he discusses the
three high abstractions, Place, Vacuum, Time. After making an end of the
 first two, he enters upon the third, beginning with the following
words:— “It follows naturally on what has been said, that we should
treat respecting Time. But first it is convenient to advert to the
difficulties involved in it, by <i>exoteric discourse also</i> — whether
 Time be included among entities or among non-entities; then afterwards,
 what is its nature. Now a man might suspect, from the following
reasons, that Time either absolutely does not exist, or exists scarcely
and dimly,” &amp;c. Aristotle then gives a string of dialectic reasons,
lasting through one of the columns of the Berlin edition, for doubting
whether Time really exists. He afterwards proceeds thus, through two
farther columns:— “Let these be enumerated as the difficulties
accompanying the attributes of Time. What Time is, and what is its
nature, is obscure, as well from what has been handed down to us by
others, as from what we ourselves have just gone through;”<a name="FnAnchor2_39" href="#Footnote2_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> and this question also he first discusses dialectically, and then brings to a solution. </p>

Time is? What is the nature of Time? Upon this he goes through another
column of &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;, difficulties and counter-difficulties, until p. 219,
a. 1, when he approaches to a positive determination, as the sequel of
various negatives — &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#959;&#8020;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8020;&#964;’ &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#8001; &#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;

throughout two farther columns (see &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#969;, a. 30), until at length
he arrives at his final definition of Time — &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056;

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>Now what
 is it that Aristotle here means by “exoteric discourse?” We may
discover by reading the matter comprised between the two foregoing
citations. We find a string of perplexing difficulties connected with
the supposition that Time exists: such as, “That all Time is either past
 or future, of which the former no longer exists, and the latter does
not yet exist; that the Now is no part of Time, for every Whole is
composed of its Parts, and Time is not composed of Nows,” &amp;c. I do
not go farther here into these subtle suggestions, because my present
purpose is only to illustrate what Aristotle calls “exoteric discourse,”
 by exhibiting what he himself announces to be a specimen thereof. It is
 the process of noticing and tracing out all the doubts and difficulties
 (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962;) which beset the enquiry in hand, along with the different
opinions entertained about it either by the vulgar, or by individual
philosophers, and the various reasons whereby such opinions may be
sustained or impugned. It is in fact the same process as that which,
when performed (as it was habitually and actively in his age) between
two disputants, he calls <i>dialectic debate</i>; and which he seeks to
encourage as well as to regulate in his treatise entitled Topica. He
contrasts it with philosophy, or with the strictly didactic and
demonstrative procedure: wherein the teacher lays down principles which
he requires the learner to admit, and then deduces from them, by
syllogisms constructed in regular form, consequences indisputably
binding on all who have admitted the principles. But though Aristotle
thus distinguishes Dialectic from Philosophy, he at the same time
declares it to be valuable as an auxiliary towards the purpose of
philosophy, and as an introductory exercise before the didactic stage
begins. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>The
 philosopher ought to show his competence as a dialectician, by
indicating and handling those various difficulties and controversies
bearing on his subject, which have already been made known, either in
writings or in oral debate.<a name="FnAnchor2_40" href="#Footnote2_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

Compare also the commencement of book B. in the Metaphysica, p. 995, a.

discussion of numerous &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;. Aristotle himself refers to it
afterwards (<span class="smcap">&#915;</span>. p. 1004, a. 32) in the words &#8021;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#952;&#951;.</p>

We thus learn, from the example furnished by Aristotle himself, what he
means by “exoteric discourses.” The epithet means literally, <i>extraneous to</i>, <i>lying on the outside of</i>; in the present case, on the outside of philosophy, considered in its special didactic and demonstrative march.<a name="FnAnchor2_41" href="#Footnote2_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a>
 Yet what thus lies outside philosophy, is nevertheless useful as an
accompaniment and preparation for philosophy. We shall find Aristotle
insisting upon this in his Topica and Analytica; and we shall also find
him introducing the exoteric treatment into his most abstruse
philosophical treatises (the Physica is one of the most abstruse) as an
accompaniment and auxiliary — a dialectic survey of opinions, puzzles,
and controverted points, before he begins to lay down and follow out
affirmative principles of his own. He does this not only throughout the
Physica (in several other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>passages besides that which I have just cited),<a name="FnAnchor2_42" href="#Footnote2_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> but also in the Metaphysica, the treatises De Animâ, De Generatione et Corruptione, &amp;c.</p>

<p>
Having thus learnt to understand, from one distinct passage of Aristotle
 himself, what he means by “exoteric discourses,” we must interpret by
the light of this analogy the other indistinct passages in which the
phrase occurs. We see clearly that in using the phrase, he does not of
necessity intend to refer to any other writings of his own — nor even to
 any other writings at all. He may possibly mean this; but we cannot be
sure of it. He means by the phrase, a dialectic process of turning over
and criticizing diverse opinions and probabilities: whether in his own
writings, or in those of others, or in no writings at all, but simply in
 those oral debates which his treatise called Topica presupposes — this
is a point which the phrase itself does not determine. He <i>may</i>
mean to allude, in some cases where he uses the phrase, to his own lost
dialogues; but he may also allude to Platonic and other dialogues, or to
 colloquies carried on orally by himself with his pupils, or to oral
debates on intellectual topics between other active-minded men. When
Bernays refers “exoteric discourse” to the lost Aristotelian Dialogues;
when Madvig, Zeller, Torstrick, Forchhammer, and others, refer it to the
 contemporary oral dialectic<a name="FnAnchor2_43" href="#Footnote2_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> — I think that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>neither
 of these explanations is in itself inadmissible. The context of each
particular passage must decide which of the two is the more probable. We
 cannot go farther, in explaining the seven doubtful passages where
Aristotle alludes to the “exoteric discourses,” than to understand the
general character and scope of the reasonings which he thus designates.
Extra-philosophical, double-sided, dialectic, is in general (he holds)
insufficient by itself, and valuable only as a preparation and auxiliary
 to the didactic process. But there are some particular points on which
such dialectic leaves a result sufficient and satisfactory, which can be
 safely accepted as the basis of future deduction. These points he
indicates in the passages above cited; without informing us more
particularly whether the dialectic was written or spoken, and whether by
 himself or by others.<a name="FnAnchor2_44" href="#Footnote2_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

 Ueberweg (Geschichte der Philos. des Alterthums, vol. i. § 46, p. 127,
2nd ed.) gives a just and accurate view of &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;, as
conceived by Aristotle. See also the dissertation of Buhle, prefixed to
his unfinished edition of Aristotle, De Aristotelis Libris Exotericis et
 Acroamaticis, pp. 107-152 — which discusses this subject copiously, and
 gives a collection both of the passages and comments which bear upon
it. It is instructive, though his opinion leans too much towards the
supposition of a double doctrine. Bernays, in his dissertation, Die
Dialoge des Aristoteles, maintains that by <i>exoteric books</i> are
always meant the lost dialogues of Aristotle; and he employs much
reasoning to refute the supposition of Madvig (Excurs. VII. ad Cicero,
de Fin. p. 861), of Torstrick (ad Aristotel. de Animâ, p. 123), and also
 of Zeller, that by exoteric discourses are not meant any writings at
all, but simply the colloquies and debates of cultivated men, apart from
 the philosophical schools. On the other hand, Forchhammer has espoused
this last-mentioned opinion, and has defended it against the objections
of Bernays (Forchhammer, Aristoteles und die exoterischen Reden, p. 16,
seq.). The question is thus fully argued on both sides. To me it seems
that each of these two opinions is partially right, and neither of them
exclusively right. “Exoteric discourse,” as I understand it, might be
found both in the Aristotelian dialogues, and in the debates of
cultivated men out of the schools, and also in parts of the Aristotelian
 akroamatic works. The argument of Bernays (p. 36, seq.), that the
points which Aristotle alludes to as having been debated and settled in
exoteric discourses, were too abstruse and subtle to have been much
handled by cultivated men out of the schools, or (as he expresses it) in
 the <i>salons</i> or coffee-houses (or what corresponded thereto) at
Athens — this argument seems to me untenable. We know well, from the
Topica of Aristotle, that the most abstruse subjects were handled
dialectically, in a manner which he called extra-philosophical; and that
 this was a frequent occupation of active-minded men at Athens. To
discuss these matters in the way which he calls &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#957;, was more
frequent than to discuss them &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;.</p>
<p>
Zell remarks (ad Ethica Nikom. i. 13), after referring to the passage in
 Aristotle’s Physica, iv. 10 (to which I have called attention in a <a href="#Footnote2_41">previous note</a>),
 “quo loco, à Buhlio neglecto, &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; idem significant quod

priusquam suas rationes in disputando proponat, disquirere solet
Aristoteles. Vide supra, ad cap. viii. 1.” I find also in Weisse
(Translation of and Comment on the Physica of Aristotle, p. 517) a fair
explanation of what Aristotle really means by <i>exoteric</i>; an explanation, however, which Ritter sets aside, in my judgment erroneously (Geschichte der Philosophie, vol. iii. p. 23).</p></div>

Pseudo-Andronikus as referring to oral colloquy of Aristotle himself
with pupils or interlocutors; and this <i>may</i> possibly be a correct explanation.</p></div>
<p>
From the time of Cicero downward, a distinction has been drawn between
some books of Aristotle which were exoteric, and others that were not
so; these last being occasionally designated as <i>akroamatic</i>. Some
modern critics have farther tried to point out which, among the
preserved works of Aristotle, belonged to each of these heads. Now there
 existed, doubtless, in the days of Cicero, Strabo, Plutarch, and
Gellius, books of Aristotle properly called <i>exoteric</i>, <i>i.e.</i> consisting almost entirely of exoteric discourse and debate; though whether Aristotle himself would have spoken of an exoteric <i>book</i>, I have some doubt. Of such a character were his Dialogues. But all the works designated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>as
 akroamatic (or non-exoteric) must probably have contained a certain
admixture of “exoteric discourse”; as the Physica (&#934;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7944;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;) and
the Metaphysica are seen to contain now. The distinction indicated by
Cicero would thus be really between one class of works, wherein
“exoteric discourse” was exclusive or paramount, — and another, in which
 it was partially introduced, subordinate to some specified didactic
purpose.<a name="FnAnchor2_45" href="#Footnote2_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
 To this last class belong all the works of Aristotle that we possess at
 present. Cicero would have found none of them corresponding to his
notion of an exoteric book.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_45" id="Footnote2_45"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_45">45</a></span>
 To this extent I go along with the opinion expressed by Weisse in his
translation of the Physica of Aristotle, p. 517: “Dass dieser Gegensatz
kein absoluter von zwei durchaus getrennten Bücherclassen ist, sondern
dass ein und dasselbe Werk zugleich <i>exoterisch</i> und <i>esoterisch</i> sein konnte; und zweitens, dass <i>exoterisch</i>
 überhaupt dasjenige heisst, was nicht in den positiv-dogmatischen
Zusammenhang der Lehre des Philosophen unmittelbar als Glied eintritt.”
But Weisse goes on afterwards to give a different opinion (about the
meaning of <i>exoteric</i> books), conformable to what I have cited in a
 previous note from Sepulveda; and in that I do not concur. However, he
remarks that the manner in which Aristotle handled the Abstracta, <i>Place</i> and <i>Infinite</i>, is just the same as that which he declares to be <i>exoteric</i> in the case of <i>Time</i>.
 The distinction drawn by Aulus Gellius (xx. 5) is not accurate:
“&#7960;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8048; dicebantur, quæ ad rhetoricas meditationes, facultatem
argutiarum, civiliumque rerum notitiam conducebant. &#7944;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8048; autem
vocabantur, in quibus philosophia remotior subtiliorque agitabatur;
quæque ad naturæ contemplationes, disceptationesque dialecticas
pertinebant.” It appears to me that <i>disceptationes dialecticæ</i> ought to be transferred to the department &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#940;, and that <i>civilium rerum notitia</i>
 belongs as much to &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8048; as to &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#940;. M. Ravaisson has
discussed this question very ably and instructively, Essai sur la
Métaphysique d’Aristote, pp. 224-244. He professes indeed to defend the
opinion which I have cited from Sepulveda, and which I think erroneous;
but his reasonings go really to the support of the opinion given in my
text. He remarks, justly, that the dialogues of Plato (at least all the
dialogues of Search) are specimens of exoteric handling; of which
attribute Forchhammer speaks as if it were peculiar to the Charmides
(Aristot. Exot. Reden. p. 22). Brandis (Aristoteles, p. 105) thinks that
 when Aristotle says in the Politica, vii. 1, p. 1323, a. 21: &#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;
 &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#7985;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#7936;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#950;&#974;&#951;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;, he intends to designate the
Ethica. It may be so; yet the Politica seems a continuation of the
Ethica: moreover, even in the Ethica, we find reference made to previous
 discussions, &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; (Eth. N. I. 13).</p></div>
<p>
To understand fully the extent comprehended by the word <i>exoteric</i>, we must recollect that its direct and immediate meaning is negative — <i>extraneous to philosophy</i>,
 and suitable to an audience not specially taught or prepared for
philosophy. Now this negative characteristic belongs not merely to
dialectic (as we see it in the example above cited from the Aristotelian
 Physica), but also to rhetoric or rhetorical argument. We know that, in
 Aristotle’s mind, the rhetorical handling and the dialectical handling,
 are placed both of them under the same head, as dealing with opinions
rather than with truth.<a name="FnAnchor2_46" href="#Footnote2_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> Both the one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>and
 the other are parted off from the didactic or demonstrative march which
 leads to philosophical truth; though dialectic has a distant affinity
with that march, and is indeed available as an auxiliary skirmisher. The
 term <i>exoteric</i> will thus comprehend both rhetorical argument and dialectical argument.<a name="FnAnchor2_47" href="#Footnote2_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 Of the latter, we have just seen a specimen extracted from the Physica;
 of the former, I know no specimen remaining, but there probably were
many of them in the Aristotelian dialogues now lost — that which was
called ‘Eudemus,’ and others. With these dialogues Cicero was probably
more familiar than with any other composition of Aristotle. I think it
highly probable that Aristotle alludes to the dialogues in some of the
passages where he refers to “exoteric discourses.” To that extent I
agree with Bernays; but I see no reason to believe (as he does) that the
 case is the same with all the passages, or that the epithet is to be
understood <i>always</i> as implying one of these lost Aristotelian dialogues.<a name="FnAnchor2_48" href="#Footnote2_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a></p>

 See the first two chapters of Aristotle’s Rhetorica, especially pp.
1355 a. 24-35, 1358 a. 5, 11, 25, also p. 1404 a. 1.: &#8005;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#959;&#8020;&#963;&#951;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#957;</span> &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8165;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#957;, which is exactly what he says also about Dialectic, in the commencement of the Topica.</p></div>

 Octavianus Ferrarius observes, in his treatise De Sermonibus Exotericis
 (Venet. 1575), p. 24: “Quod si Dialecticus et Rhetor inter se mutant,
ut aiunt, ita ut Dialecticus Rhetorem et Rhetor Dialecticum vicissim
induat — de his ipsis veteribus Dialecticis minime nobis dubitandum est,
 quin iidem dialectice simul et rhetorice loqui in utramque partem
potuerint. Nec valde mirum debet hoc videri; libros enim exotericos
prope solos habuerunt: qui cum scripti essent (ut posterius planum
faciam) dialectico more, illorum lectio cum libris peperit philosophos
congruentes” — Ferrari adverts well to the distinction between the
philosopher and the dialectician (<i>sensu Aristotelico</i>), handling
often the same subjects, but in a different way: between the &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;
&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;, upon which didactic method rested, and the &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#953; or diverse
opinions, each countenanced by more or less authority, from which
dialectic took its departure (pp. 36, 86, 89).</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote2_48" id="Footnote2_48"></a><a href="#FnAnchor2_48">48</a></span>
 I agree very much with the manner in which Bernays puts his case, pp.
79, 80, 92, 93: though there is a contradiction between p. 80 and p. 92,
 in respect to the taste and aptitude of the exterior public for
dialectic debate; which is affirmed in the former page, denied in the
latter. But the doctrine asserted in the pages just indicated amounts
only to this — that the dialogues were <i>included in</i> Aristotle’s phrase, &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;; which appears to me true.</p></div>
<p>
There grew up, in the minds of some commentators, a supposition of
“exoteric doctrine” as denoting what Aristotle promulgated to the
public, contrasted with another secret or mystic doctrine reserved for a
 special few, and denoted by the term <i>esoteric</i>; though this term is not found in use before the days of Lucian.<a name="FnAnchor2_49" href="#Footnote2_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 I believe the supposition of a double doctrine to be mistaken in regard
 to Aristotle; but it is true as to the Pythagoreans, and is not without
 some colour of truth even as to Plato. That Aristotle employed one
manner of explanation and illustration, when discussing with advanced
pupils, and another, more or less different, when addressing an
unprepared audience, we may hold as certain and even unavoidable; but
this does not amount to a double positive doctrine. Properly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>speaking,
 indeed, the term “exoteric” (as I have just explained it out of
Aristotle himself) does not designate, or even imply, any positive
doctrine at all. It denotes a many-sided controversial debate, in which
numerous points are canvassed and few settled; the express purpose being
 to bring into full daylight the perplexing aspects of each. There are
indeed a few exceptional cases, in which “exoteric discourse” will
itself have thrown up a tolerably trustworthy result: these few (as I
have above shown) Aristotle occasionally singles out and appeals to. But
 as a general rule, there is no <i>doctrine</i> which can properly be called <i>exoteric</i>:
 the “exoteric discourse” suggests many new puzzles, but terminates
without any solution at all. The doctrine, whenever any such is proved,

<h2><span class="smcap">
CATEGORIÆ.</span> </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the prodigious total of works composed by Aristotle, I have
already mentioned that the larger number have perished. But there still
remain about forty treatises, of authenticity not open to any reasonable
 suspicion, which attest the grandeur of his intelligence, in respect of
 speculative force, positive as well as negative, systematizing
patience, comprehensive curiosity as to matters of fact, and diversified
 applications of detail. In taking account of these treatises, we
perceive some in which the order of sequence is determined by assignable
 reasons; as regards others, no similar grounds of preference appear.
The works called 1. De Cœlo; 2. De Generatione et Corruptione; 3.
Meteorologica, — are marked out as intended to be studied in immediate
succession, and the various Zoological treatises after them. The cluster
 entitled Parva Naturalia is complementary to the treatise De Animâ. The
 Physica Auscultatio is referred to in the Metaphysica, and discusses
many questions identical or analogous, standing in the relation of prior
 to a posterior, as the titles indicate; though the title ‘Metaphysica’
is not affixed or recognized by Aristotle himself, and the treatise so
called includes much that goes beyond the reach of the Physica. As to
the treatises on Logic, Rhetoric, Ethics, Politics, Poetics, Mechanics,
&amp;c., we are left to fix for ourselves the most convenient order of
study. Of no one among them can we assign the date of composition or
publication. There are indeed in the Rhetorica, Politics, and
Meteorologica, various allusions which must have been written later than
 some given events of known date; but these allusions may have been
later additions, and cannot be considered as conclusively proving,
though they certainly raise a presumption, that the entire work was
written subsequently to those events.</p>
<p>
The proper order in which the works of Aristotle ought to be studied
(like the order proper for studying the Platonic dialogues),<a name="FnAnchor3_1" href="#Footnote3_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was matter of debate from the time of his earliest <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>editors
 and commentators, in the century immediately preceding the Christian
era. Boêthus the Sidonian (Strabo’s contemporary and fellow-student)
recommended that the works on natural philosophy and physiology should
be perused first; contending that these were the easiest, the most
interesting, and, on the whole, the most successful among all the
Aristotelian productions. Some Platonists advised that the ethical
treatises should be put in the front rank, on the ground of their
superior importance for correcting bad habits and character; others
assigned the first place to the mathematics, as exhibiting superior
firmness in the demonstrations. But Andronikus himself, the earliest
known editor of Aristotle’s works, arranged them in a different order,
placing the logical treatises at the commencement of his edition. He
considered these treatises, taken collectively, to be not so much a part
 of philosophy as an <i>Organon</i> or instrument, the use of which must
 be acquired by the reader before he became competent to grasp or
comprehend philosophy; as an exposition of method rather than of
doctrine.<a name="FnAnchor3_2" href="#Footnote3_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> From the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>time
 of Andronikus downward, the logical treatises have always stood first
among the written or printed works of Aristotle. They have been known
under the collective title of the ‘Organon,’ and as such it will be
convenient still to regard them.<a name="FnAnchor3_3" href="#Footnote3_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

 Scholia, p. 25, b. 37, seq. Br.; p. 321, b. 30; Diogen. L. iii. 62. The
 order in which the forty-six Aristotelian treatises stand printed in
the Berlin edition, and in other preceding editions, corresponds to the
tripartite division, set forth by Aristotle himself, of sciences or
cognitions generally: 1. Theoretical; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943; 2. Practical;
&#960;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;. 3. Constructive or Technical; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;.</p>
<p>
Patricius, in his Discussiones Peripateticæ, published in 1581 (tom. i.
lib. xiii. p. 173), proclaims himself to be the first author who will
undertake to give an account of Aristotle’s philosophy <i>from Aristotle himself</i>
 (instead of taking it, as others before him had done, from the
Aristotelian expositors, Andronikus, Alexander, Porphyry, or Averroes);
likewise, to be the first author who will consult <i>all</i> the works
of Aristotle, instead of confining himself, as his predecessors had
done, to a select few of the works. Patricius then proceeds to enumerate
 those works upon which alone the professors “in Italicis scholis”
lectured, and to which the attention of all readers was restricted. 1.
The Predicabilia, or Eisagoge of Porphyry. 2. The Categoriæ. 3. The De
Interpretatione. 4. The Analytica Priora; but only the four first
chapters of the first book. 5. The Analytica Posteriora; but only a few
chapters of the first book; nothing of the second. 6. The Physica; books
 first and second; then parts of the third and fourth; lastly, the
eighth book. 7. The De Cœlo; books first and second. 8. The De
Generatione et Corruptione; books first and second. 9. The De Animâ; all
 the three books. 10. The Metaphysica; books Alpha major, Alpha minor,
third, sixth, and eleventh. “Idque, quadriennio integro, quadruplicis
ordinis Philosophi perlegunt auditoribus. De reliquis omnibus tot
libris, mirum silentium.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Patricius expressly remarks that neither the Topica nor the De
Sophisticis Elenchis was touched in this full course of four years. But
he does not remark — what to a modern reader will seem more surprising —
 that neither the Ethica, nor the Politica, nor the Rhetorica, is
included in the course.</p></div>

 Aristot. Topica, i. p. 104, b. 1, with the Scholia of Alexander, p.
259, a. 48 Br.; Scholia ad Analyt. Prior. p. 140, a. 47, p. 141, a. 25;
also Schol. ad Categor. p. 36, a., p. 40, a., 8. This conception of the
Organon is not explicitly announced by Aristotle, but seems quite in
harmony with his views. The contemptuous terms in which Prantl speaks of
 it (Gesch. der Logik, i. 136), as a silly innovation of the Stoics, are
 unwarranted.</p>
<p>
Aristotle (Metaph. E. i. p. 1025, b. 26) classifies the sciences as
&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;, &#960;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;, &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;; next he subdivides the first of the
three into &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#942;, &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;, &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;. Brentano, after
remarking that no place in this distribution is expressly provided for
Logic, explains the omission as follows: “Diese auffallende Erscheinung
erklärt sich daraus, dass diese [the three above-named theoretical
sciences] allein das reelle Sein betrachten, und nach den drei Graden
der Abstraktion in ihrer Betrachtungsweise verschieden, geschieden
werden; während die Logik das bloss rationelle Sein, das &#8003;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962;,
behandelt.” (Ueber die Bedeutung des Seienden nach Aristoteles, p. 39.) —
 Investigations &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;, &#8003;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; are
considered by Aristotle as belonging to &#964;&#8048; &#7944;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;; enquiries into
method in the first instance, and into doctrine chiefly with a view to
method (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> p. 1005, b. 2. In Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> 1005, b. 7, he declares that these enquiries into method, or analysis of the <i>principia</i> of syllogistic reasoning, belong to the Philosophia Prima (compare Metaphys. <span class="smcap">Z.</span>
 12, p. 1037, b. 8). Schwegler in his Commentary (p. 161) remarks that
this is one of the few passages in which Aristotle indicates the
relation in which Logic stands to Metaphysics, or First Philosophy. The
question has been started among his &#7944;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;<span class="correction" title="missing in 2nd ed.">,</span> Metaph. B. 2, p. 999, b. 30.</p></div>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_3" id="Footnote3_3"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_3">3</a></span> Respecting the title of Organon which was sometimes applied to the Analytica Posteriora only, see Waitz ad Organ. ii. p. 294.</p></div>
<p>
These treatises are six in number:— 1. Categoriæ;<a name="FnAnchor3_4" href="#Footnote3_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
 2. De Interpretatione, or De Enunciatione; 3. Analytica Priora; 4.
Analytica Posteriora; 5. Topica; 6. De Sophisticis Elenchis. This last
short treatise — De Sophisticis Elenchis — belongs naturally to the
Topica which precedes it, and of which it ought to be ranked as the
ninth or concluding book. Waitz has printed it as such in his edition of
 the Organon; but as it has been generally known with a separate place
and title, I shall not depart from the received understanding. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_4" id="Footnote3_4"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_4">4</a></span>
 Some eminent critics, Prantl and Bonitz among them, consider the
treatise Categoriæ not to be the work of Aristotle. The arguments on
which this opinion rests are not convincing to me; and even if they
were, the treatise could not be left out of consideration, since the <i>doctrine</i> of the Ten Categories is indisputably Aristotelian. See Zeller, Die Phil. der Griech. ii. 2, pp. 50, 51, 2nd ed.</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle himself does not announce these six treatises as forming a
distinct aggregate, nor as belonging to one and the same department, nor
 as bearing one comprehensive name. We find indeed in the Topica
references to the Analytica, and in the Analytica references to the
Topica. In both of them, the ten Categories are assumed and presupposed,
 though the treatise describing them is not expressly mentioned: to both
 also, the contents of the treatise De Interpretatione or Enunciatione,
though it is not named, are indispensable. The affinity and
interdependence of the six is evident, and justifies the practice of the
 commentators in treating them as belonging to one and the same
department. To that department there belonged also several other
treatises of Aristotle, not now preserved, but specified in the
catalogue of his lost works; and these his disciples Theophrastus,
Eudemus, and Phanias, had before them. As all these three disciples
composed treatises of their own on the same or similar topics,<a name="FnAnchor3_5" href="#Footnote3_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> amplifying, elucidating, or controverting the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>views
 of their master, the Peripatetics immediately succeeding them must have
 possessed a copious logical literature, in which the six treatises now
constituting the Organon appeared as portions, but not as a special
aggregate in themselves.</p>

<p>
Of the two treatises which stand first in the Aristotelian Organon — the
 Categoriæ and the De Interpretatione — each forms in a certain sense
the complement of the other. The treatise De Interpretatione handles
Propositions (combinations of terms in the way of Subject and
Predicate), with prominent reference to the specific attribute of a
Proposition — the being true or false, the object of belief or
disbelief; the treatise Categoriæ deals with these same Terms (to use
Aristotle’s own phrase) pronounced without or apart from such
combination. In his definition of the simple Term, the Proposition is at
 the same time assumed to be foreknown as the correlate or antithesis to
 it.<a name="FnAnchor3_6" href="#Footnote3_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>
The Categories of Aristotle appear to formed one of the most prominent
topics of the teaching of Themistius: rebutting the charge, advanced
both against himself, and, in earlier days, against Sokrates and the
Sophists, of rendering his pupils presumptuous and conceited, he asks,
&#7968;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#948;&#8050; &#945;&#8022; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#951;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#8017;&#968;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#946;&#961;&#949;&#957;&#952;&#965;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; <span class="gesp">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7970; &#8001;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7970; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>; (Orat. xxiii. p. 351.)</p>
<p>
Reference is made (in the Scholia on the Categoriæ, p. 43, b. 19) to a
classification of names made by Speusippus, which must have been at
least as early as that of Aristotle; perhaps earlier, since Speusippus
died in 339 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> We do not hear enough of
this to understand clearly what it was. Boêthus remarked that Aristotle
had omitted to notice some distinctions drawn by Speusippus on this
matter, Schol. p. 43, a. 29. Compare a remark in Aristot. De Cœlo, i. p.
 280, b. 2.</p></div>
<p>
The first distinction pointed out by Aristotle among simple, uncombined
Terms, or the things denoted thereby, is the Homonymous, the Synonymous,
 and the Paronymous. <i>Homonymous</i> are those which are called by the same name, used in a different sense or with a different definition or rational explanation. <i>Synonymous</i> are those called by the same name in the same sense. <i>Paronymous</i> are those called by two names, of which the one is derived from the other by varying the inflexion or termination.<a name="FnAnchor3_7" href="#Footnote3_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_7" id="Footnote3_7"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_7">7</a></span> Aristot. Categor. p. 1, a. 1-15.</p></div>
<p>
We can hardly doubt that it was Aristotle who first gave this peculiar
distinctive meaning to the two words Homonymous and Synonymous, rendered
 in modern phraseology (through the Latin) <i>Equivocal</i> and <i>Univocal</i>.
 Before his time this important distinction between different terms had
no technical name to designate it. The service rendered to Logic by
introducing such a technical term, and by calling attention to the lax
mode of speaking which it indicated, was great. In every branch of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>writings
 Aristotle perpetually reverts to it, applying it to new cases, and
especially to those familiar universal words uttered most freely and
frequently, under the common persuasion that their meaning is not only
thoroughly known but constant and uniform. As a general fact, students
are now well acquainted with this source of error, though the stream of
particular errors flowing from it is still abundant, ever renewed and
diversified. But in the time of Aristotle the source itself had never
yet been pointed out emphatically to notice, nor signalized by any
characteristic term as by a beacon. The natural bias which leads us to
suppose that one term always carries one and the same meaning, was not
counteracted by any systematic warning or generalized expression.
Sokrates and Plato did indeed expose many particular examples of
undefined and equivocal phraseology. No part of the Platonic writings is
 more valuable than the dialogues in which this operation is performed,
forcing the respondent to feel how imperfectly he understands the
phrases constantly in use. But it is rarely Plato’s practice to furnish
generalized positive warnings or systematic distinctions. He has no
general term corresponding to homonymous or equivocal; and there are
even passages where (under the name of Prodikus) he derides or
disparages a careful distinctive analysis of different significations of
 the same name. To recognize a class of equivocal terms and assign
thereto a special class-name, was an important step in logical
procedure; and that step, among so many others, was made by Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchor3_8" href="#Footnote3_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_8" id="Footnote3_8"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_8">8</a></span>
 In the instructive commentary of Dexippus on the Categoriæ (contained
in a supposed dialogue between Dexippus and his pupil Seleukus, of which
 all that remains has been recently published by Spengel, Munich, 1859),
 that commentator defends Aristotle against some critics who wondered
why he began with these Ante-predicaments (&#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#945;, &#963;&#965;&#957;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#945;, &amp;c.),
instead of proceeding at once to the Predicaments or Categories
themselves. Dexippus remarks that without understanding this distinction
 between <i>equivoca</i> and <i>univoca</i>, the Categories themselves
could not be properly appreciated; for Ens — &#964;&#8056; &#8002;&#957; — is homonymous in
reference to all the Categories, and not a Summum Genus, comprehending
the Categories as distinct species under it; while each Category is a
Genus in reference to its particulars. Moreover, Dexippus observes that
this distinction of homonyms and synonyms was altogether unknown and
never self-suggested to the ordinary mind (&#8005;&#963;&#969;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;,
&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;, p. 20), and therefore required to be brought
 out first of all at the beginning; whereas the Post-predicaments (to
which we shall come later on) were postponed to the end, because they
were cases of familiar terms loosely employed. (See Spengel, Dexipp. pp.
 19, 20, 21.)</p></div>
<p>
Though Aristotle has professed to distinguish between terms implicated in predication, and terms not so implicated,<a name="FnAnchor3_9" href="#Footnote3_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>when
 he comes to explain the functions of the latter class, he considers
them in reference to their functions as constituent members of
propositions. He immediately begins by distinguishing four sorts of
matters (<i>Entia</i>): That which is affirmable of a Subject, but is
not in a Subject; That which is in a Subject, but is not affirmable of a
 Subject; That which is both in a Subject, and affirmable of a Subject;
That which is neither in a Subject, nor affirmable of a Subject.<a name="FnAnchor3_10" href="#Footnote3_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>
It will be seen that the meaning and function of the single word can
only explained relatively to the complete proposition, which must be
assumed as foreknown.</p>

<p>That which Aristotle discriminates in this treatise, in the phrases —

This fundamental quadruple distinction of <i>Entia</i>, which serves as
an introduction to the ten Categories or Predicaments, belongs to words
altogether according to their relative places or functions in the
proposition; the meanings of the words being classified accordingly.
That the learner may understand it, he ought properly to be master of
the first part of the treatise De Interpretatione, wherein the
constituent elements of a proposition are explained: so intimate is the
connection between that treatise and this.</p>
<p>
The classification applies to <i>Entia</i> (Things or Matters)
universally, and is thus a first step in Ontology. He here looks at
Ontology in one of its several diverse aspects — as it enters into
predication, and furnishes the material for Subjects and Predicates, the
 constituent members of a proposition.</p>
<p>
Ontology, or the Science of <i>Ens quatenus Ens</i>, occupies an
important place in Aristotle’s scientific programme; bearing usually the
 title of First Philosophy, sometimes Theology, though never (in his
works) the more modern title of Metaphysica. He describes it as the
universal and comprehensive Science, to which all other sciences are
related as parts or fractions. Ontology deals with <i>Ens</i> in its widest sense, as an <i>Unum</i>
 not generic but analogical — distinguishing the derivative varieties
into which it may be distributed, and setting out the attributes and
accompaniments of <i>Essentia</i> universally; while other sciences, such as Geometry, Astronomy, &amp;c., confine themselves to distinct branches of that whole;<a name="FnAnchor3_11" href="#Footnote3_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> each having its own separate class of <i>Entia</i>
 for special and exclusive study. This is the characteristic distinction
 of Ontology, as Aristotle conceives it; he does not set it in
antithesis to Phenomenology, according to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>the distinction that has become current among modern metaphysicians. </p>

Now <i>Ens</i> (or <i>Entia</i>), in the doctrine of Aristotle, is not a
 synonymous or univocal word, but an homonymous or equivocal word; or,
rather, it is something between the two, being equivocal, with a certain
 qualification. Though not a <i>Summum Genus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> not
manifesting throughout all its particulars generic unity, nor divisible
into species by the addition of well-marked essential <i>differentiæ</i>, it is an analogical aggregate, or a <i>Summum Analogon</i>,
 comprehending under it many subordinates which bear the same name from
being all related in some way or other to a common root or <i>fundamentum</i>, the relationship being both diverse in kind and nearer or more distant in degree. The word <i>Ens</i> is thus homonymous, yet in a qualified sense. While it is not univocal, it is at the same time not absolutely equivocal. It is <i>multivocal</i> (if we may coin such a word), having many meanings held together by a multifarious and graduated relationship to one common <i>fundamentum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_12" href="#Footnote3_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> <i>Ens</i> (or <i>Entia</i>),
 in this widest sense, is the theme of Ontology or First Philosophy, and
 is looked at by Aristotle in four different principal aspects.<a name="FnAnchor3_13" href="#Footnote3_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

 Simplikius speaks of these Analoga as &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

Dexippus does not recognize, formally and under a distinct title, this
intermediate stage between &#963;&#965;&#957;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#945; and &#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#945;. He states that
Aristotle considered Ens as &#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957;, while other philosophers
considered it as &#963;&#965;&#957;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957; (Dexippus, p. 26, book i. sect. 19, ed.
Spengel). But he intimates that the ten general heads called Categories
have a certain continuity and interdependence (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;&#957;) each with the others, branching out from &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; in
ramifications more or less straggling (p. 48, book ii. sects. 1, 2,
Spengel). The list (he says, p. 47) does not depend upon &#948;&#953;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;
(generic division), nor yet is it simple enumeration (&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;) of
incoherent items. In the Physica, vii. 4, p. 249, a. 23, Aristotle
observes: &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7985; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#8058; &#7936;&#960;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#945;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;

<p>
These four are the principal aspects under which Aristotle looks at the aggregate comprised by the equivocal or multivocal word <i>Entia</i>.
 In all the four branches, the varieties comprised are not species under
 a common genus, correlating, either as co-ordinate or subordinate, one
to the other; they are <i>analoga</i>, all having relationship with a
common term, but having no other necessary relationship with each other.
 Aristotle does not mean that these four modes of distributing this vast
 aggregate, are the only modes possible; for he himself sometimes
alludes to other modes of distributions.<a name="FnAnchor3_15" href="#Footnote3_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 Nor would he maintain that the four distributions were completely
distinguished from each other, so that the same subordinate fractions
are not comprehended in any two; for on the contrary, the branches
overlap each other and coincide to a great degree, especially the first
and fourth. But he considers the four as discriminating certain distinct
 aspects of <i>Entia</i> or <i>Entitas</i>, more important than any
other aspects thereof that could be pointed out, and as affording thus
the best basis and commencement for the Science called Ontology.</p>

<p>
Of these four heads, however, the first and second are rapidly dismissed by Aristotle in the Metaphysica,<a name="FnAnchor3_16" href="#Footnote3_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> being conceived as having little reference to real essence, and therefore belonging more to Logic than to Ontology; <i>i.e.</i>

<p>
&#932;&#8048; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945; are equivalent to &#964;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, in this and the other logical
treatises of Aristotle. Categ. p. 1, a. 16-20, b. 25; Analyt. Prior. i.
p. 43, a. 25.</p>
<p>
This is the logical aspect of Ontology; that is, Entia are considered as
 Objects to be named, and to serve as Subjects or Predicates for
propositions: every such term having a fixed denotation, and (with the
exception of proper names) a fixed connotation, known to speakers and
hearers.</p>
<p>
&#932;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; (or Entia considered in this aspect) are distinguished by Aristotle into two classes: 1. &#932;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; <span class="gesp">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#942;&#957;</span>, &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;, &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#953;&#954;&#8119;. 2.  &#932;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; <span class="gesp">&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8134;&#962;</span> (or &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#951;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#942;&#957;)  &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#946;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, &#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;, &#957;&#953;&#954;&#8119;.</p>
<p>
We are to observe here, that in Logic the Proposition or Enunciation is
the Prius Naturâ, which must be presupposed as known before we can
understand what the separate terms are (Analytic. Prior. i. p. 24, a.
16): just as the right angle must be understood before we can explain
what is an acute or an obtuse angle (to use an illustration of
Aristotle; see Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#918;.</span> p. 1035, b. 7).
We must understand the entire logical act, called Affirming or Denying,
before we can understand the functions of the two factors or correlates
with which that act is performed. Aristotle defines the Term by means of
 the Proposition, &#8005;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182; &#949;&#7984; &#8002;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7969; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; (Anal. Pr. i.

&#932;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, as here used by Aristotle, coincides in meaning with what
the Stoics afterwards called &#932;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#940; — of two classes: 1. <span class="gesp">&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8048; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8134;</span>, one branch of which, &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#958;&#953;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, are equivalent to the Aristotelian &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8052;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;. 2. <span class="gesp">&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#955;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#8134;</span>,
 equivalent to &#964;&#8048; &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; (Diogen. Laert. vii. 43, 44,
63, 64; Sext. Emp. adv. Mathemat. viii. 69, 70, 74): equivalent also,
seemingly, to &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8048; in Aristotle: &#8001; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962; (Anal.

Hobbes observes (Computation or Logic, part i. 2, 5): “Nor is it at all
necessary that every name should be the name of something. For as these,
 <i>a man</i>, <i>a tree</i>, <i>a stone</i>, are the names of the
things themselves, so the images of a man, of a tree, of a stone, which
are represented to men sleeping, have their names also, though they be
not things, but only fictions and phantasms of things. For we can
remember these; and therefore it is no less necessary that they have
names to mark and signify them, than the things themselves. Also this
word <i>future</i> is a name; but no future thing has yet any being.
Moreover, that which neither is, nor has been, nor ever shall or ever
can be, has a name — <i>impossible</i>. To conclude, this word <i>nothing</i>
 is a name, which yet cannot be name of any thing; for when we subtract
two and three from five, and, so nothing remaining, we would call that
subtraction to mind, this speech <i>nothing remains</i>, and in it the word <i>nothing</i>, is not unuseful. And for the same reason we say truly, <i>less than nothing</i>
 remains, when we subtract more from less; for the mind feigns such
remains as these for doctrine’s sake, and desires, as often as is
necessary, to call the same to memory. But seeing every name has some
relation to that which is named, though that which we name be not always
 a thing that has a being in nature, yet it is lawful for doctrine’s
sake to apply the word <i>thing</i> to whatsoever we name; as it were all one whether that thing truly existent, or be only feigned.”</p>

&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#940;) covers all that Hobbes here includes under the word <i>thing</i>. — Scholia ad Aristot. Physic. I. i. p. 323, a. 21, Brand.: &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945;, &#8001;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#945; &#964;&#8048; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945;.</p></div>

Of this mixed character, partly logical, partly ontological, is the
first distinction set forth in the Categoriæ — the distinction between
matters <i>predicated of</i> a Subject, and matters which are <i>in</i> a Subject — the Subject itself being assumed as the <i>fundamentum</i> correlative to both of them. The definition given of that which is <i>in</i> a Subject is ontological: viz., “<i>In</i> a Subject, I call that which is in anything, not as a part, yet so that it cannot exist separately from that in which it is.”<a name="FnAnchor3_18" href="#Footnote3_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> By these two negative characteristics, without any mark positive, does Aristotle define what is meant by being <i>in</i>
 a Subject. Modern logicians, and Hobbes among them, can find no better
definition for an Accident; though Hobbes remarks truly, that Accident
cannot be properly defined, but must be elucidated by examples.<a name="FnAnchor3_19" href="#Footnote3_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> </p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>The distinction here drawn by Aristotle between being <i>predicated of</i>
 a Subject, and being in a Subject, coincides with that between
essential and non-essential predication: all the predicates (including
the <i>differentia</i>) which belong to the essence, fall under the first division;<a name="FnAnchor3_20" href="#Footnote3_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
 all those which do not belong to the essence, under the latter. The
Subjects — what Aristotle calls the First Essences or Substances, those
which are essences or substances in the fullest and strictest meaning of
 the word — are concrete individual things or persons; such as Sokrates,
 this man, that horse or tree. These are never employed as predicates at
 all (except by a distorted and unnatural structure of the proposition,
which Aristotle indicates as possible, but declines to take into
account); they are always Subjects of different predicates, and are, in
the last analysis, the Subjects of all predicates. But besides these
First Essences, there are also Second Essences — Species and Genus,
which stand to the first Essence in the relation of predicates to a
Subject, and to the other Categories in the relation of Subjects to
predicates.<a name="FnAnchor3_21" href="#Footnote3_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 These Second Essences are less of Essences than the First, which alone
is an Essence in the fullest and most appropriate sense. Among the
Second Essences, Species is more of an Essence than Genus, because it
belongs more closely and specially to the First Essence; while Genus is
farther removed from it. Aristotle thus recognizes a graduation of <i>more or less</i>
 in Essence; the individual is more Essence, or more complete as an
Essence, than the Species, the Species more than the Genus. As he
recognizes a First Essence, <i>i.e.</i> an individual object (such as
Sokrates, this horse, &amp;c.), so he also recognizes an individual
accident (this particular white colour, that particular grammatical
knowledge) which is <i>in</i> a Subject, but is not <i>predicated of</i> a Subject; this particular white colour exists <i>in</i> some given body, but is not <i>predicable of</i> any body.<a name="FnAnchor3_22" href="#Footnote3_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

 Aristot. Categ. p. 3, a. 20. It appears that Andronikus did not draw
the line between these two classes of predicates in same manner as
Aristotle: he included many non-essential predicates in &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#952;’
&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;. See Simplikius, ad Categorias, Basil. 1551, fol. 13, 21, B.

an attribute as “individual and as numerically one;” and various other
logicians have followed him. But is it correct to say, that an
attribute, when it cannot be farther divided specifically, and is thus
the lowest in its own predicamental series, is <i>Unum Numero</i>? The attribute may belong to an indefinite number of different objects; and can we count it as <i>One</i>, in the same sense in which we count each of these objects as <i>One</i>? I doubt whether <i>Unum Numero</i> be applicable to attributes. Aristotle declares that the &#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; is not <i>Unum Numero</i>
 like the &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; — &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7969; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;
&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8182;&#957; &#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; (Categ. p. 3, b.
16). Upon the same principle, I think, he ought to declare that the
attribute is not <i>Unum Numero</i>; for though it is not (in his language) <i>predicable of</i> many Subjects, yet it is <i>in</i> many Subjects. It cannot correctly be called <i>Unum Numero</i>, according to the explanation which he gives of that phrase in two passages of the Metaphysica, <span class="smcap">B</span>. p. 999, b. 33; <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>. p. 1016, b. 32: &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8183; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#8039;&#957; &#7969; &#8021;&#955;&#951; &#956;&#943;&#945;, &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
Respecting the logical distinction, which Aristotle places in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>the commencement of this treatise on the Categories — between predicates which are <i>affirmed of</i> a Subject, and predicates which are <i>in</i> a Subject<a name="FnAnchor3_23" href="#Footnote3_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 — we may remark that it turns altogether upon the name by which you
describe the predicate. Thus he tells us that the Species and Genus
(man, animal), and the Differentia (rational), may be <i>predicated of</i> Sokrates, but are not <i>in</i> Sokrates; while knowledge is <i>in</i> Sokrates, but cannot be <i>predicated of</i> Sokrates; and may be <i>predicated of</i> grammar, but is not <i>in</i>
 grammar. But if we look at this comparison, we shall see that in the
last-mentioned example, the predicate is described by an abstract word
(knowledge); while in the preceding examples it is described by a
concrete word (man, animal, rational).<a name="FnAnchor3_24" href="#Footnote3_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 If, in place of these three last words, we substitute the abstract
words corresponding to them — humanity, animality, rationality — we
shall have to say that these are <i>in</i> Sokrates, though they cannot (in their abstract form) be <i>predicated of</i>
 Sokrates, but only in the form of their concrete paronyms, which
Aristotle treats as a distinct predication. So if, instead of the
abstract word knowledge, we employ the concrete word knowing or wise, we
 can no longer say that this is <i>in</i> Sokrates, and that it may be <i>predicated of</i> grammar. Abstract alone can be <i>predicated of</i> abstract; concrete alone can be <i>predicated of</i> concrete; if we describe the relation between Abstract and Concrete, we must say, The Abstract is <i>in</i>
 the Concrete — the Concrete contains or embodies the Abstract. Indeed
we find Aristotle referring the same predicate, when described by the
abstract name, to one Category; and when described by the concrete
paronymous adjective, to another and different Category.<a name="FnAnchor3_25" href="#Footnote3_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> The names Concrete and Abstract were not in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>philosophical
 vocabulary of his day. In this passage of the Categoriæ, he establishes
 a distinction between predicates essential and predicates
non-essential; the latter he here declares to be <i>in</i> the Subject, the former not to be in it, but to be <i>co-efficients of</i>
 its essence. But we shall find that he does not adhere to this
distinction even throughout the present treatise, still less in other
works. It seems to be a point of difference between the Categoriæ on one
 side, and the Physica and Metaphysica on the other, that in the
Categoriæ he is more disposed to found supposed real distinctions on
verbal etiquette, and on precise adherence to the syntactical structure
of a proposition.<a name="FnAnchor3_26" href="#Footnote3_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a></p>

 The difference of opinion as to the proper mode of describing the
Differentia — whether by the concrete word &#960;&#949;&#950;&#8056;&#957;, or by the abstract
&#960;&#949;&#950;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; — gives occasion to an objection against Aristotle’s view, and
to a reply from Dexippus not very conclusive (Dexippus, book ii. s. 22,

 Categor. p. 3, a. 3. In the Physica, iv. p. 210, a. 14-30, Aristotle
enumerates nine different senses of the phrase &#7957;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#953;. His own use of
the phrase is not always uniform or consistent. If we compare the
Scholia on the Categoriæ, pp. 44, 45, 53, 58, 59, Br., with the Scholia
on the Physica, pp. 372, 373, Br., we shall see that the Commentators
were somewhat embarrassed by his fluctuation. The doctrine of the
Categoriæ was found especially difficult in its application to the
Differentia.</p>

In Analyt. Post. i. p. 83, a. 30, Aristotle says, &#8005;&#963;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8052; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;

 with the language of the Categoriæ, as the Scholiast remarks, p. 228,
a. 33. The like may be said about Metaphys. <span class="smcap">B</span>. p. 1001, b. 29; <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>. p. 1017, b. 13. See the Scholia of Alexander, p. 701, b. 25, Br.</p>

<p>
Lastly, Aristotle here makes one important observation respecting those predicates which he describes as (not <i>in a Subject</i> but) <i>affirmed</i> or <i>denied of</i> a Subject — <i>i.e.</i>
 the essential predicates. In these (he says) whatever predicate can be
truly affirmed or denied of the predicate, the same can be truly
affirmed or denied of the Subject.<a name="FnAnchor3_27" href="#Footnote3_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
 This observation deserves notice, because it is in fact a brief but
distinct announcement of his main theory of the Syllogism; which theory
he afterwards expands in the Analytica Priora, and traces into its
varieties and ramifications.</p>

<p>
After such preliminaries, Aristotle proceeds<a name="FnAnchor3_28" href="#Footnote3_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 to give the enumeration of his Ten Categories or Predicaments; under
one or other of which, every subject or predicate, considered as capable
 of entering into a proposition, must belong: 1. <i>Essence</i> or <i>Substance</i>; such as, man, horse. 2. <i>How much</i> or <i>Quantity</i>; such as, two cubits long, three cubits long. 3. <i>What manner of</i> or <i>Quality</i>; such as, white, erudite. 4. <i>Ad aliquid — To something</i> or <i>Relation</i>; such as, double, half, greater. 5. <i>Where</i>; such as, in the market-place, in the Lykeium. 6. <i>When</i>; such as, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>yesterday, last year. 7. <i>In what posture</i>; such as, he stands up, he is sitting down. 8. <i>To have</i>; such as, to be shod, to be armed. 9. <i>Activity</i>; such as, he is cutting, he is turning. 10. <i>Passivity</i>; such as, he is being cut, he is being burned. </p>

<p>
<i>Ens</i> in its complete state — concrete, individual, determinate — includes an embodiment of all these ten Categories; the First <i>Ens</i>
 being the Subject of which the rest are predicates. Whatever question
be asked respecting any individual Subject, the information given in the
 answer must fall, according to Aristotle, under one or more of these
ten general heads; while the full outfit of the individual will comprise
 some predicate under each of them. Moreover, each of the ten is a <i>Generalissimum</i>; having more or fewer species contained under it, but not being itself contained under any larger genus (<i>Ens</i>
 not being a genus). So that Aristotle does not attempt to define or
describe any one of the ten; his only way of explaining is by citing two
 or three illustrative examples of each. Some of the ten are even of
wider extent than <i>Summa Genera</i>; thus, Quality cannot be considered as a true genus, comprehending generically all the cases falling under it. It is a <i>Summum Analogon</i>,
 reaching beyond the comprehension of a genus; an analogous or
multivocal name, applied to many cases vaguely and remotely akin to each
 other.<a name="FnAnchor3_29" href="#Footnote3_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 And again the same particular predicate may be ranked both under
Quality and under Relation; it need not belong exclusively to either one
 of them.<a name="FnAnchor3_30" href="#Footnote3_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> Moreover, Good, like <i>Ens</i> or <i>Unum</i>, is common to all the Categories, but is differently represented in each.<a name="FnAnchor3_31" href="#Footnote3_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

Aristotle comments at considerable length upon the four first of the ten
 Categories. 1. Essence or Substance. 2. Quantity. 3. Quality. 4.
Relation. As to the six last, he says little upon any of them; upon
some, nothing at all.</p>
<p>
His decuple partition of <i>Entia</i> or <i>Enunciata</i> is founded
entirely upon a logical principle. He looks at them in their relation to
 Propositions; and his ten classes discriminate the relation which they
bear to each other as parts or constituent elements of a proposition.
Aristotle takes his departure, not from any results of scientific
research, but from common speech; and from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>dialectic, frequent in his time, which debated about matters of common life and talk, about received and current opinions.<a name="FnAnchor3_32" href="#Footnote3_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
 We may presume him to have studied and compared a variety of current
propositions, so as to discover what were the different relations in
which Subjects and Predicates did stand or could stand to each other;
also the various questions which might be put respecting any given
subject, with the answers suitable to be returned.<a name="FnAnchor3_33" href="#Footnote3_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>

natura et veritate exponit, sed res tales capit, quales apparent in
communi vita homini philosophia non imbuto, unde fit, ut in Categoriis
alia sit &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; et in prima philosophia: illa enim partes habet,

The different meaning of &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; in the Categoriæ and in the

Aristotle ranks as his first and fundamental Category <span class="sc">Substance</span> or <span class="sc">Essence</span>
 — &#927;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;; the abstract substantive word corresponding to &#932;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;; which
last is the vast aggregate, not generically One but only analogically
One, destined to be distributed among the ten Categories as <i>Summa Genera</i>. The First <i>Ens</i> or First Essence — that which is <i>Ens</i> in the fullest sense — is the <i>individual</i> concrete person or thing in nature; Sokrates, Bukephalus, this man, that horse, that oak-tree, &amp;c. This First <i>Ens</i> is indispensable as Subject or <i>Substratum</i>
 for all the other Categories, and even for predication generally. It is
 a Subject only; it never appears as a predicate of anything else. As <i>Hic Aliquis</i> or <i>Hoc Aliquid</i>, it lies at the bottom (either expressed or implied) of all the work of predication. It is <i>Ens</i> or Essence most of all, <i>par excellence</i>; and is so absolutely indispensable, that if all First <i>Entia</i> were supposed to be removed, neither Second <i>Entia</i> nor any of the other Categories could exist.<a name="FnAnchor3_34" href="#Footnote3_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a></p>

The Species is recognized by Aristotle as a Second <i>Ens</i> or
Essence, in which these First Essences reside; it is less (has less
completely the character) of Essence than the First, to which it serves
as Predicate. The Genus is (strictly speaking) a Third Essence,<a name="FnAnchor3_35" href="#Footnote3_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> in which both the First and the Second <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>Essence
 are included; it is farther removed than the Species from the First
Essence, and has therefore still less of the character of Essence. It
stands as predicate both to the First and to the Second Essence. While
the First Essence is more Essence than the Second, and the Second more
than the Third, all the varieties of the First Essence are in this
respect upon an equal footing with each other. This man, this horse,
that tree, &amp;c., are all Essence, equally and alike.<a name="FnAnchor3_36" href="#Footnote3_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> The First Essence admits of much variety, but does not admit graduation, or degrees of more or less. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_35" id="Footnote3_35"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_35">35</a></span>
 Aristotle here, in the Categoriæ, ranks Genus and Species as being,
both of them, &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;. Yet since he admits Genus to be farther
removed from &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; than Species is, he ought rather to have called
 Genus a Third Essence. In the Metaphysica he recognizes a gradation or
ordination of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; into First, Second, and Third, founded upon a
totally different principle: the Concrete, which in the Categoriæ ranks
as &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, ranks as &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; in the Metaphysica. See Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#919;</span>. p. 1043, a. 18-28.</p></div>

<p>
Nothing else except Genera and Species can be called Second Essences, or
 said to belong to the Category Essence; for they alone declare what the
 First Essence is. If you are asked respecting Sokrates, <i>What</i> he <i>is</i>?
 and if you answer by stating the Species or the Genus to which he
belongs — that he is a man or an animal — your answer will be
appropriate to the question; and it will be more fully understood if you
 state the Species than if you state the Genus. But if you answer by
stating what belongs to any of the other Categories (viz., that he is
white, that he is running), your answer will be inappropriate, and
foreign to the question; it will not declare <i>what</i> Sokrates <i>is</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_37" href="#Footnote3_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 Accordingly, none of these other Categories can be called Essences. All
 of them rank as predicates both of First and of Second Essence; just as
 Second Essences rank as predicates of First Essences.<a name="FnAnchor3_38" href="#Footnote3_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>

Essence or Substance is not <i>in</i> a Subject; neither First nor Second Essence. The First Essence is neither <i>in</i> a Subject nor <i>predicated of</i> a Subject; the Second Essences are not <i>in</i> the First, but are <i>predicated of</i> the First. Both the Second Essence, and the definition of the word describing it, may be <i>predicated of</i> the First; that is, the predication is synonymous or univocal; whereas, of that which is <i>in</i>
 a Subject, the name may often be predicated, but never the definition
of the name. What is true of the Second Essence, is true also of the
Differentia; that it is not <i>in</i> a Subject, but that it may be <i>predicated</i> univocally <i>of</i> a Subject — not only its name, but also the definition of its name.<a name="FnAnchor3_39" href="#Footnote3_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>All Essence or Substance seems to signify <i>Hoc Aliquid Unum Numero</i>.
 The First Essence really does so signify, but the Second Essence does
not really so signify: it only seems to do so, because it is enunciated
by a substantive name, like the First.<a name="FnAnchor3_40" href="#Footnote3_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> It signifies really <i>Tale Aliquid</i>, answering to the enquiry <i>Quale Quid</i>?
 for it is said not merely of one thing numerically, but of many things
each numerically one. Nevertheless, a distinction must be drawn. The
Second Essence does not (like the Accident, such as white) signify <i>Tale Aliquid</i> simply and absolutely, or that and nothing more. It signifies <i>Talem Aliquam Essentiam</i>; it declares what the Essence is, or marks off the characteristic feature of various First Essences, each <i>Unum Numero</i>.

But that which is most peculiar to Essence, is, that while remaining <i>Unum et Idem Numero</i>,
 it is capable by change in itself of receiving alternately contrary
Accidents. This is true of no other Category. For example, this
particular colour, being one and the same in number, will never be now
black, and then white; this particular action, being one and the same in
 number, will not be at one time virtuous, at another time vicious. The
like is true respecting all the other Categories. But one and the same
man will be now white, hot, virtuous; at another time, he will be black,
 cold, vicious. An objector may say that this is true, not merely of
Essence, but also of Discourse and of Opinion; each of which (he will
urge) remains <i>Unum Numero</i>, but is nevertheless recipient of contrary attributes; for the proposition or assertion, Sokrates is sitting, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>may
 now be true and may presently become false. But this case is different,
 because there is no change in the proposition itself, but in the person
 or thing to which the proposition refers; while one and the same man,
by new affections in himself, is now healthy, then sick; now hot, then
cold.<a name="FnAnchor3_44" href="#Footnote3_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

<p>
Here Aristotle concludes his first Category or Predicament — Essence or Substance. He proceeds to the other nine, and ranks <span class="sc">Quantity</span> first among them.<a name="FnAnchor3_45" href="#Footnote3_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> <i>Quantum</i>
 is either Continual or Discrete; it consists either of parts having
position in reference to each other, or of parts not having position in
reference to each other. Discrete <i>Quanta</i> are Number and Speech; Continual <i>Quanta</i>
 are Line, Surface, Body, and besides these, Time and Place. The parts
of Number have no position in reference to each other; the parts of
Line, Surface, Body, have position in reference to each other. These are
 called <i>Quanta</i>, primarily; other things are called <i>Quanta</i> in a secondary way, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;.<a name="FnAnchor3_46" href="#Footnote3_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> Thus we say <i>much white</i>, when the surface of white is large; we say, <i>the action is long</i>, because much time and movement have been consumed in it. If we are asked, <i>how long the action</i> is? we must answer by specifying its length in time — a year or a month.</p>

<p>
To <i>Quantum</i> (as to Essence or Substance) there exists no contrary.<a name="FnAnchor3_47" href="#Footnote3_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 There is nothing contrary to a length of three cubits or an area of
four square feet. Great, little, long, short, are more properly terms of
 Relation than terms of Quantity; thus belonging to another Category.
Nor is <i>Quantum</i> ever more or less <i>Quantum</i>; it does not admit of degree. The <i>Quantum</i> a yard is neither more nor less <i>Quantum</i> than that called a foot. That which is peculiar to <i>Quanta</i> is to be equal or unequal:<a name="FnAnchor3_48" href="#Footnote3_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> the relations of equality and inequality are not properly affirmed of anything else except of <i>Quanta</i>.</p>

<p>
From the Category of Quantity, Aristotle proceeds next to that of <span class="sc">Relation</span>;<a name="FnAnchor3_49" href="#Footnote3_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 which he discusses in immediate sequence after Quantity, and before
Quality, probably because in the course of his exposition about
Quantity, he had been obliged to intimate how closely Quantity was
implicated with Relation, and how essential it was that the distinction
between the two should be made clear. </p>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_49" id="Footnote3_49"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_49">49</a></span> Ibid. a. 36, seq.</p></div>
<p>
<i>Relata</i> (&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; — <i>ad Aliquid</i>) are things such, that what they are, they are said to be <i>of other things</i>, or are said to in some other manner <i>towards something else</i> (&#8005;&#963;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8048; &#7941;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span><span class="correction" title="amended from '&#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#974;&#957;'">&#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span>  &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#7970; &#8001;&#960;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;). Thus, that which is greater, is said to be greater <i>than another</i>; that which is called double is called also double <i>of another</i>. Habit, disposition, perception, cognition, position, &amp;c., are all <i>Relata</i>. Habit, is habit <i>of something</i>; perception and cognition, are always <i>of something</i>; position, is position <i>of something</i>.
 The Category of Relation admits contrariety in some cases, but not
always; it also admits, in some cases, graduation, or the more or less
in degree; things are more like or less like to each other.<a name="FnAnchor3_50" href="#Footnote3_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> All <i>Relata</i> are so designated in virtue of their relation to other <i>Correlata</i>; the master is master <i>of a servant</i> — the servant is servant <i>of a master</i>. Sometimes the <i>Correlatum</i> is mentioned not in the genitive case but in some other case; thus cognition is cognition <i>of</i> the <i>cognitum</i>, but <i>cognitum</i> is <i>cognitum by</i> cognition; perception is perception <i>of</i> the <i>perceptum</i>, but the <i>perceptum</i> is <i>perceptum by</i> perception.<a name="FnAnchor3_51" href="#Footnote3_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
 The correlation indeed will not manifestly appear, unless the Correlate
 be designated by its appropriate term: thus, if the wing be declared to
 be wing <i>of a bird</i>, there is no apparent correlation; we ought to say, the wing is wing <i>of the winged</i>, and the winged is winged <i>through</i> or <i>by</i> the wing; for the wing belongs to the bird, not <i>quâ bird</i>, but <i>quâ winged</i>,<a name="FnAnchor3_52" href="#Footnote3_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
 since there are many things winged, which are not birds. Sometimes
there is no current term appropriate to the Correlate, so that we are
under the necessity of coining one for the occasion: we must say, to
speak with strict accuracy, &#7969; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#942;, &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#942; not &#7969; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#942;,

The <i>Relatum</i> and its Correlate seem to be <i>simul naturâ</i>. If
you suppress either one of the pair, the other vanishes along with it.
Aristotle appears to think, however, that there are many cases in which
this is not true. He says that there can be no <i>cognoscens</i> without a <i>cognoscibile</i>, nor any <i>percipiens</i> without a <i>percipibile</i>; but that there may be <i>cognoscibile</i> without any <i>cognoscens</i>, and <i>percipibile</i> without any <i>percipiens</i>. He says that &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; exists &#960;&#961;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;.<a name="FnAnchor3_54" href="#Footnote3_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> Whether any Essence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>or Substance can be a <i>Relatum</i>
 or not, he is puzzled to say; he seems to think that the Second Essence
 may be, but that the First Essence cannot be so. He concludes, however,
 by admitting that the question is one of doubt and difficulty.<a name="FnAnchor3_55" href="#Footnote3_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a></p>

65, a. 16, b. 18, Br.) is instructive. He gives his own opinion, and
that of some preceding commentators, adverse to Aristotle. He says that
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; and &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; and &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;, are not properly
correlates. The actual correlates with the actual, the potential with
the potential. Now, in the above pairs, &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; are
 potentials, while <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#956;&#951;'">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>
 and &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; are actuals; therefore it is correct to say that &#964;&#8056;
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; will not cease to exist if you take away
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; and &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. But the real and proper correlate to &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957;
 would be &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;: the proper correlate to &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; would be
 &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957;. And when we take these two latter pairs, it is perfectly
 correct to say, &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#8150; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#945;.</p>

 makes &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; correlate with &#964;&#8048; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#940;, we must understand &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; as
equivalent to &#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, and as different from &#7969; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;.</p></div>

<p>
<span class="sc">Quality</span> is that according to which Subjects are
called Such and Such (&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;). It is, however, not a true genus,
but a vague word, of many distinct, though analogous, meanings including
 an assemblage of particulars not bound together by any generic tie.<a name="FnAnchor3_56" href="#Footnote3_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a>
 The more familiar varieties are — 1. Habits or endowments (&#7957;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;) of a
durable character, such as, wise, just, virtuous; 2. Conditions more or
less transitory, such as, hot, cold, sick, healthy, &amp;c. (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;);
 3. Natural powers or incapacities, such as hard, soft, fit for boxing,
fit for running, &amp;c. 4. Capacities of causing sensation, such as
sweet of honey, hot and cold of fire and ice. But a person who
occasionally blushes with shame, or occasionally becomes pale with fear,
 does not receive the designation of <i>such or such</i> from this fact; the occasional emotion is a passion, not a quality.<a name="FnAnchor3_57" href="#Footnote3_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> </p>

The abstract term &#928;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; was a new coinage in Plato’s time; he introduces it with an apology (Theætet. p. 182 A.).</p></div>

<p>
A fifth variety of Quality is figure or circumscribing form,
straightness or crookedness. But dense, rare, rough, smooth, are not
properly varieties of Quality; objects are not denominated <i>such and such</i>
 from these circumstances. They rather declare position of the particles
 of an object in reference to each other, near or distant, evenly or
unevenly arranged.<a name="FnAnchor3_58" href="#Footnote3_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a></p>

<p>
Quality admits, in some cases but not in all, both contrariety and
graduation. Just is contrary to unjust, black to white; but there is no
contrary to red or pale. If one of two contraries belongs to Quality,
the other of the two will also belong to Quality. In regard to
graduation, we can hardly say that Quality in the abstract is capable of
 more and less; but it is indisputable that different objects have more
or less of the same quality. One man is more just, healthy, wise, than
another; though justice or health in itself cannot be called more or
less. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>One thing cannot be more a triangle, square, or circle than another; the square is not more a circle than the oblong.<a name="FnAnchor3_59" href="#Footnote3_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a></p>

<p>
What has just been said is not peculiar to Quality; but one peculiarity
there is requiring to be mentioned. Quality is the foundation of
Similarity and Dissimilarity. Objects are called <i>like</i> or <i>unlike</i> in reference to qualities.<a name="FnAnchor3_60" href="#Footnote3_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a></p>

<p>
In speaking about Quality, Aristotle has cited many illustrations from <i>Relata</i>. Habits and dispositions, described by their generic names, are <i>Relata</i>; in their specific varieties they are Qualities. Thus cognition is always cognition <i>of something</i>, and is therefore a <i>Relatum</i>; but <i>grammatiké</i> (grammatical cognition) is not <i>grammatiké of any thing</i>, and is therefore a Quality. It has been already intimated<a name="FnAnchor3_61" href="#Footnote3_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> that the same variety may well belong to two distinct Categories.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_61" id="Footnote3_61"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_61">61</a></span> Ibid. a. 20-38. &#7956;&#964;&#953; &#949;&#7984; &#964;&#973;&#947;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; &#8004;&#957;, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;.</p></div>
<p>
After having thus dwelt at some length on each of the first four
Categories, Aristotle passes lightly over the remaining six. Respecting <i>Agere</i> and <i>Pati</i>, he observes that they admit (like Quality) both of graduation and contrariety. Respecting <i>Jac&#275;re</i>
 he tells us that the predicates included in it are derived from the
fact of positions, which positions he had before ranked among the <i>Relata</i>. Respecting <i>Ubi</i>, <i>Quando</i>, and <i>Habere</i>,
 he considers them all so manifest and intelligible, that he will say
nothing about them; he repeats the illustrations before given — <i>Habere</i>, as, to be shod, or to be armed (to have shoes or arms); <i>Ubi</i>, as, in the Lykeium; <i>Quando</i>, as, yesterday, last year.<a name="FnAnchor3_62" href="#Footnote3_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a></p>

<p>
No part of the Aristotelian doctrine has become more incorporated with
logical tradition, or elicited a greater amount of comment and
discussion,<a name="FnAnchor3_63" href="#Footnote3_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
 than these Ten Categories or Predicaments. I have endeavoured to give
the exposition as near as may be in the words and with the illustrations
 of Aristotle; because in many of the comments new points of view are
introduced, sometimes more just than those of Aristotle, but not present
 to his mind. Modern logicians join the Categories side by side with the
 five Predicables, which are explained in the Eisagoge of Porphyry, more
 than five centuries after Aristotle’s death. As expositors of Logic
they are right in doing this; but my purpose is to illustrate rather the
 views of Aristotle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span> The mind of Aristotle was not altogether exempt from that fascination<a name="FnAnchor3_64" href="#Footnote3_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
 which particular numbers exercised upon the Pythagoreans and after them
 upon Plato. To the number Ten the Pythagoreans ascribed peculiar virtue
 and perfection. The fundamental Contraries, which they laid down as the
 Principles of the Universe, were ten in number.<a name="FnAnchor3_65" href="#Footnote3_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
 After them, also, Plato carried his ideal numbers as far as the Dekad,
but no farther. That Aristotle considered Ten to be the suitable number
for a complete list of general heads — that he was satisfied with making
 up the list of ten, and looked for nothing beyond — may be inferred
from the different manner in which he deals with the different items. At
 least, such was his point of view when he composed this treatise.
Though he recognizes all the ten Categories as co-ordinate in so far
that (except <i>Quale</i>) each is a distinct Genus, not reducible under
 either of the others, yet he devotes all his attention to the first
four, and gives explanations (copious for him) in regard to these. About
 the fifth and sixth (<i>Agere</i> and <i>Pati</i>)<a name="FnAnchor3_66" href="#Footnote3_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
 he says a little, though much less than we should expect, considering
their extent and importance. About the last four, next to nothing
appears. There are even passages in his writings where he seems to drop
all mention of the two last (<i>Jacere</i> and <i>Habere</i>), and to
recognize no more than eight Predicaments. In the treatise Categoriæ
where his attention is fastened on Terms and their signification, and on
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>the appropriate way of combining these terms into propositions, he recites the ten <i>seriatim</i>;
 but in other treatises, where his remarks bear more upon the matter and
 less upon the terms by which it is signified, he thinks himself
warranted in leaving out the two or three whose applications are most
confined to special subjects. If he had thought fit to carry the total
number of Predicaments to twelve or fifteen instead of ten,<a name="FnAnchor3_67" href="#Footnote3_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> he would probably have had little difficulty in finding some other general heads not less entitled to admission than <i>Jacere</i> and <i>Habere</i>;
 the rather, as he himself allows, even in regard to the principal
Categories, that particulars comprised under one of them may also be
comprised under another, and that there is no necessity for supposing
each particular to be restricted to one Category exclusively.</p>

 p. 986, a. 8. There existed, in the time of the later Peripatetics, a
treatise in the Doric dialect by Archytas — &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#962; —
discriminating Ten Categories, and apparently the same ten Categories as
 Aristotle. By several Aristotelian critics this treatise was believed
to have been composed by Archytas the Tarentine, eminent both as a
Pythagorean philosopher and as the leading citizen of Tarentum — the
contemporary and friend of Plato, and, therefore, of course, earlier
than Aristotle. Several critics believed that Aristotle had borrowed his
 Ten Categories from this work of Archytas; and we know that the latter
preserved the total number of Ten. See Schol. ad Categor. p. 79, b. 3,
Br.</p>
<p>
But other critics affirmed, apparently with better reason, that the
Archytas, author of this treatise, was a Peripatetic philosopher later
than Aristotle; and that the doctrine of Archytas on the Categories was
copied from Aristotle in the same manner as the Doric treatise on the
Kosmos, ascribed to the Lokrian Timæus, was copied from the Timæus of
Plato, being translated into a Doric dialect.</p>
<p>
See Scholia of Simplikius and Boëthius, p. 33, a. 1, n.; p. 40, a. 43,
Brandis. The fact that this treatise was ascribed to the Tarentine
Archytas, indicates how much the number Ten was consecrated in men’s
minds as a Pythagorean canon.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_66" id="Footnote3_66"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_66">66</a></span> Trendelenburg thinks (Geschichte der Kategorienlehre, p. 131) that Aristotle must have handled the Categories <i>Agere</i>, and <i>Pati</i>
 more copiously in other treatises; and there are some passages in his
works which render this probable. See De Animâ, ii. p. 416, b. 35; De
Generat. Animal. iv. p. 768, b. 15. Moreover, in the list of Aristotle’s
 works given by Diogenes Laertius, one title appears — &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953; (Diog. L. v. 22).</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_67" id="Footnote3_67"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_67">67</a></span> Prantl expresses this view in his Geschichte der Logik (p. 206), and I think it just.</p></div>
<p>
These remarks serve partly to meet the difficulties pointed out by
commentators in regard to the Ten Categories. From the century
immediately succeeding Aristotle, down to recent times, the question has
 always been asked, why did Aristotle fix upon Ten Categories rather
than any other number? and why upon these Ten rather than others? And
ancient commentators<a name="FnAnchor3_68" href="#Footnote3_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
 as well as modern have insisted, that the classification is at once
defective and redundant; leaving out altogether some particulars, while
it enumerates others twice over or more than twice. (This last charge
is, however, admitted by Aristotle himself, who considers it no ground
of objection that the same particular may sometimes be ranked under two
distinct heads.) The replies made to the questions, and the attempts to
shew cause for the selection of these Ten classes, have not been
satisfactory; though it is certain that Aristotle himself treats the
classification as if it were real and exhaustive,<a name="FnAnchor3_69" href="#Footnote3_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> obtained by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>comparing
 many propositions and drawing from them an induction. He tries to
determine, in regard to some particular enquiries, under which of the
Ten <i>Summa Genera</i> the subject of the enquiry is to be ranged; he indicates some predicate of extreme generality (<i>Unum</i>, <i>Bonum</i>, &amp;c.), which extend over all or several Categories, as equivocal or analogous, representing no true <i>Genera</i>.
 But though Aristotle takes this view of the completeness of his own
classification, he never assigns the grounds of it, and we are left to
make them out in the best way we can.</p>

<p>
Brentano (in his treatise, Ueber die Bedeutung des Seienden in
Aristoteles, Sects. 12 and 13, pp. 148-177) attempts to draw out a
scheme of systematic deduction for the Categories. He quotes (pp. 181,
182) a passage from Thomas Aquinas, in which such a scheme is set forth
acutely and plausibly. But if Aristotle had had any such system present
to his mind, he would hardly have left it to be divined by commentators.</p>
<p>
Simplikius observes (Schol. ad Categ. p. 44, a. 30) that the last nine
Categories coincide in the main (excepting such portion of <i>Quale</i>
as belongs to the Essence) with &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;: which latter,
according to Aristotle’s repeated declarations, can never be the matter
of any theorizing or scientific treatment — &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#945; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;
&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945;, Metaphys. <span class="smcap">E.</span> p. 1026, b. 4; <span class="smcap">K.</span>
 p. 1064, b. 17. This view of Aristotle respecting &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;, is
hardly consistent with a scheme of intentional deduction for the
accidental predicates.</p></div>
<p>
We cannot safely presume, I think, that he followed out any deductive
principle or system; if he had done so, he would probably have indicated
 it. The decuple indication of general heads arose rather from
comparison of propositions and induction therefrom. Under each of these
ten heads, some predicate or other may always be applied to every
concrete individual object, such as a man or animal. Aristotle proceeded
 by comparing a variety of propositions, such as were employed in common
 discourse or dialectic, and throwing the different predicates into <i>genera</i>,
 according as they stood in different logical relation to the Subject.
The analysis applied is not metaphysical but logical; it does not
resolve the real individual into metaphysical &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; or Principles, such
as Form and Matter; it accepts the individual as he stands, with his
full complex array of predicates embodied in a proposition, and analyses
 that proposition into its logical constituents.<a name="FnAnchor3_70" href="#Footnote3_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> The predicates derive <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>their
 existence from being attached to the First Subject, and have a
different manner of existence according as they are differently related
to the First Subject.<a name="FnAnchor3_71" href="#Footnote3_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> What is this individual, Sokrates? He is an <i>animal</i>. What is his Species? <i>Man</i>. What is the Differentia, limiting the Genus and constituting the Species? <i>Rationality</i>, <i>two-footedness</i>. What is his height and bulk? He is <i>six feet</i> high, and is of <i>twelve stone</i> weight. What manner of man is he? He is <i>flat-nosed</i>, <i>virtuous</i>, <i>patient</i>, <i>brave</i>. In what relation does he stand to others? He is a <i>father</i>, a <i>proprietor</i>, a <i>citizen</i>, a <i>general</i>. What is he doing? He is <i>digging his garden</i>, <i>ploughing his field</i>. What is being done to him? He is <i>being rubbed with oil</i>, he is <i>having his hair cut</i>. Where is he? <i>In the city</i>, <i>at home</i>, <i>in bed</i>. When do you speak of him? <i>As he is, at this moment</i>, <i>as he was, yesterday</i>, <i>last year</i>. In what posture is he? He is <i>lying down</i>, <i>sitting</i>, <i>standing up</i>, <i>kneeling</i>, <i>balancing on one leg</i>. What is he wearing? He <i>has a tunic</i>, <i>armour</i>, <i>shoes</i>, <i>gloves</i>.</p>

&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;, which Aristotle insists upon in the Physica and
Metaphysica, the &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, &#8003; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; &#7970; &#7984;&#948;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#8017;&#966;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;,
 coincides with the &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; of the Categories, already implicated
with &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; and stopping short of metaphysical analysis.</p>
<p>
The remarks of Boêthus and Simplikius upon this point deserve attention.

the terms Form and Matter are not mentioned in the Categories, nor do
they serve to illustrate the Categories, which do not carry analysis so
far back, but take their initial start from &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;, the &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957; of

We may add, that Aristotle applies the metaphysical analysis — Form and
Matter — not only to the Category &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; but also to that of &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; and

<p>
Confining ourselves (as I have already observed that Aristotle does in
the Categories) to those perceptible or physical subjects which every
one admits,<a name="FnAnchor3_72" href="#Footnote3_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
 and keeping clear of metaphysical entities, we shall see that
respecting any one of these subjects the nine questions here put may all
 be put and answered; that the two last are most likely to be put in
regard to some living being; and that the last can seldom be put in
regard to any other subject except a person (including man, woman, or
child). Every individual person falls necessarily under each of the ten
Categories; belongs to the Genus animal, Species man; he is of a certain
 height and bulk; has certain qualities; stands in certain relations to
other persons or things; is doing something and suffering something; is
in a certain place; must be described with reference to a certain moment
 of time; is in a certain attitude or posture; is clothed or equipped in
 a certain manner. Information of some kind may always be given
respecting him under each of these heads; he is always by necessity <i>quantus</i>, but not always of any particular quantity. Until such information is given, the concrete individual is not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>known under conditions thoroughly determined.<a name="FnAnchor3_73" href="#Footnote3_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
 Moreover each head is separate and independent, not resolvable into any
 of the rest, with a reservation, presently to be noticed, of Relation
in its most comprehensive meaning. When I say of a man, that he is at
home, lying down, clothed with a tunic, &amp;c., I do not predicate of
him any quality, action, or passion. The information which I give
belongs to three other heads distinct from these last, and distinct also
 from each other. If you suppress the two last of the ten Categories and
 leave only the preceding eight, under which of these eight are you to
rank the predicates, Sokrates is <i>lying down</i>, Sokrates is <i>clothed with a tunic</i>, &amp;c.? The necessity for admitting the ninth and tenth Categories (<i>Jacere</i> and <i>Habere</i>)
 as separate general heads in the list, is as great as the necessity for
 admitting most of the Categories which precede. The ninth and tenth are
 of narrower comprehension,<a name="FnAnchor3_74" href="#Footnote3_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a>
 and include a smaller number of distinguishable varieties, than the
preceding; but they are not the less separate heads of information. So,
among the chemical elements enumerated by modern science, some are very
rarely found; yet they are not for that reason the less entitled to a
place in the list. </p>

 Prantl observes, Geschichte der Logik, p. 208:— “Fragen wir, wie
Aristoteles überhaupt dazu gekommen sei, von Kategorien zu sprechen, und
 welche Geltung dieselben bei ihm haben, so ist unsere Antwort hierauf
folgende: Aristoteles geht, im Gegensatze gegen Platon, davon aus, dass
die Allgemeinheit in der Concretion des Seienden sich verwirkliche und
in dieser Realität von dem menschlichen Denken und Sprechen ergriffen
werde; der Verwirklichungsprocess des concret Seienden ist der Uebergang
 vom Unbestimmten, jeder Bestimmung aber fähigen, zum allseitig
Bestimmten, welchem demnach die Bestimmtheit überhaupt als eine selbst
concret gewordene einwohnt und ebenso in des Menschen Rede von ihm
ausgesagt wird. Das grundwesentliche Ergebniss der Verwirklichung ist
sonach: die zeitlich-räumlich concret auftretende und hiemit individuell
 gewordene Substanzialität, in einer dem Zustande der Concretion
entsprechenden Erscheinungsweise; diese letztere umfasst das ganze
habituelle Dasein und Wirken der concreten Substanz, welche in der Welt
der räumlichen Ausdehnung numerären Vielheit erscheint. Die ontologische
 Basis demnach der Kategorien ist der in die Concretion führende
Verwirklichungsprocess der Bestimmtheit überhaupt.”</p></div>

 Plotinus, among his various grounds of exception to the ten
Aristotelian Categories, objects to the ninth and tenth on the ground of
 their narrow comprehension (Ennead. vi. 1, 23, 24).</p>
<p>
Boêthus expressly vindicated the title of &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; to be recognized as a
separate Category, against the Stoic objectors. — Schol. ad Categ. p.
81, a. 5.</p></div>
<p>
If we seek not to appreciate the value of the Ten Categories as a
philosophical classification, but to understand what was in the mind of
Aristotle when he framed it, we shall attend, not so much to the greater
 features, which it presents in common with every other scheme of
classification, as to the minor features which constitute its
peculiarity. In this point of view the two last Categories are more
significant than the first four, and the tenth is the most significant
of all; for every one is astonished when he finds <i>Habere</i> enrolled as a tenth <i>Summum Genus</i>, co-ordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span> with <i>Quantum</i> and <i>Quale</i>.
 Now what is remarkable about the ninth and tenth Categories is, that
individual persons or animals are the only Subjects respecting whom they
 are ever predicated, and are at the same time Subjects respecting whom
they are constantly (or at least frequently) predicated. An individual
person is habitually clothed in some particular way in all or part of
his body; he (and perhaps his horse also) are the only Subjects that are
 ever so clothed. Moreover animals are the only Subjects, and among them
 man is the principal Subject, whose changes of posture are frequent,
various, determined by internal impulses, and at the same time
interesting to others to know. Hence we may infer that when Aristotle
lays down the Ten Categories, as <i>Summa Genera</i> for all
predications which can be made about any given Subject, the Subject
which he has wholly, or at least principally, in his mind is an
individual Man. We understand, then, how it is that he declares <i>Habere</i> and <i>Jacere</i>
 to be so plain as to need no farther explanation. What is a man’s
posture? What is his clothing or equipment? are questions understood by
every one.<a name="FnAnchor3_75" href="#Footnote3_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> But when Aristotle treats of <i>Habere</i> elsewhere, he is far from recognizing it as narrow and plain <i>per se</i>.
 Even in the Post-Predicamenta (an appendix tacked on to the Categoriæ,
either by himself afterwards, or by some follower) he declares <i>Habere</i> to be a predicate of vague and equivocal signification; including portions of <i>Quale</i>, <i>Quantum</i>, and <i>Relata</i>.
 And he specifies the personal equipment of an individual as only one
among these many varieties of signification. He takes the same view in
the fourth book (<span class="smcap">&#916;.</span>) of the Metaphysica, which book is a sort of lexicon of philosophical terms.<a name="FnAnchor3_76" href="#Footnote3_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> This enlargement of the meaning of the word <i>Habere</i>
 seems to indicate an alteration of Aristotle’s point of view, dropping
that special reference to an individual man as Subject, which was
present to him when he drew up the list of Ten <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>Categories.
 The like alteration carried him still farther, so as to omit the ninth
and tenth almost entirely, when he discusses the more extensive topics
of philosophy. Some of his followers, on the contrary, instead of
omitting <i>Habere</i> out of the list of Categories, tried to procure
recognition for it in the larger sense which it bears in the
Metaphysica. Archytas ranked it fifth in the series, immediately after <i>Relata</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_77" href="#Footnote3_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_75" id="Footnote3_75"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_75">75</a></span>
 In the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of Mr. James Harris’s
Philosophical Arrangements, there is a learned and valuable illustration
 of these two last Aristotelian Categories. I think, however, that he
gives to the Predicament &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (<i>Jacere</i>) a larger and more
comprehensive meaning than it bears in the treatise Categoriæ; and that
neither he, nor the commentators whom he cites (p. 317), take sufficient
 notice of the marked distinction drawn in that treatise between &#954;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
 and &#952;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#962; (Cat. p. 6, b. 12). Mr. Harris ranks the arrangement of words
 in an orderly discourse, and of propositions in a valid syllogism, as
cases coming under the Predicament &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;; which is travelling far
beyond the meaning of that word in the Aristotelian Categories. At the
same time he brings out strongly the fact, that living beings, and
especially <i>men</i>, are the true and special subjects of predicates
belonging to &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; and &#7964;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;. The more we attend to this, the nearer
approach shall we make to the state of Aristotle’s mind when he drew up
the list of Categories; as indeed Harris himself seems to recognize
(chap. ii. p. 29).</p></div>

Archytas, &#945;&#7985; &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#954;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#967;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; were the equivalent of the Aristotelian
&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;.</p></div>
<p>
The narrow manner in which Aristotle conceives the Predicament <i>Habere</i>
 in the treatise Categoriæ, and the enlarged sense given to that term
both in the Post-Predicaments and in the Metaphysica, lead to a
suspicion that the Categoriæ is comparatively early, in point of date,
among his compositions. It seems more likely that he should begin with
the narrower view, and pass from thence to the larger, rather than <i>vice versâ</i>.
 Probably the predicates specially applicable to Man would be among his
early conceptions, but would by later thought be tacitly dropped,<a name="FnAnchor3_78" href="#Footnote3_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> so as to retain those only which had a wider philosophical application.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_78" id="Footnote3_78"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_78">78</a></span> Respecting the paragraph (at the close of the Categoriæ) about &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, see the Scholion in Waitz’s ed. of the Organon, p. 38.</p>
<p>
The fact that Archytas in his treatise presented the Aristotelian
Category &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; under the more general phrase of &#945;&#7985; &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#954;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#967;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;
(see the preceding note), is among the reasons for believing that
treatise to be later than Aristotle.</p></div>
<p>I have already remarked that Aristotle, while enrolling all the Ten Predicaments as independent heads, each the <i>Generalissimum</i>
 of a separate descending line of predicates, admitted at the same time
that various predicates did not of necessity belong to one of these
lines exclusively, but might take rank in more than one line. There are
some which he enumerates under all the different heads of Quality,
Relation, Action, Passion. The classification is evidently recognized as
 one to which we may apply a remark which he makes especially in regard
to Quality and Relation, under both of which heads (he says) the same
predicates may sometimes be counted.<a name="FnAnchor3_79" href="#Footnote3_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>
 And the observation is much more extensively true than he was aware;
for he both conceives and defines the Category of Relation or Relativity
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>(<i>Ad Aliquid</i>)
 in a way much narrower than really belongs to it. If he had assigned to
 this Category its full and true comprehension, he would have found it
implicated with all the other nine. None of them can be isolated from it
 in predication.</p>

<p>
Simplikius says that what Aristotle admits about &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, is true about
all the other Categories also, viz.: that it is not a strict and proper
&#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;. Each of the ten Categories is (what Aristotle says about &#964;&#8056; &#8003;&#957;)
&#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#969;&#957;. — &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;,

 (Scholia ad Categor. p. 69, b. 30, Br.) This is a remarkable
observation, which has not been sufficiently adverted to, I think, by
Brentano in his treatise on Aristotle’s Ontology.</p></div>
<p>
That <i>Agere</i> and <i>Pati</i> (with the illustrations which he himself gives thereof — <i>urit</i>, <i>uritur</i>)
 may be ranked as varieties under the generic Category of Relation or
Relativity, can hardly be overlooked. The like is seen to be true about <i>Ubi</i> and <i>Quando</i>, when we advert to any one of the predicates belonging to either; such as, <i>in the market-place</i>, <i>yesterday</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_80" href="#Footnote3_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> Moreover, not merely the last six of the ten Categories, but also the second and fourth (<i>Quantum</i> and <i>Quale</i>) are implicated with and subordinated to Relation. If we look at <i>Quantum</i>,
 we shall find that the example which Aristotle gives of it is &#964;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;,
 tricubital, or three cubits long; a term quite as clearly relative as
the term &#948;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962; or double, which he afterwards produces as instance
of the Category <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_81" href="#Footnote3_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
 When we are asked the questions, How much is the height? How large is
the field? we cannot give the information required except by a relative
predicate — <i>it is three feet</i> — <i>it is four acres</i>; we
thereby carry back the mind of the questioner to some unit of length or
superficies already known to him, and we convey our meaning by
comparison with such unit. Again, if we turn from <i>Quantum</i> to <i>Quale</i>, we find the like Relativity implied in all the predicates whereby answer is made to the question &#928;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#943;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;; <i>Qualis est</i>? What manner of man is he? <i>He is such as A, B, C</i> — persons whom we have previously seen, or heard, or read of.<a name="FnAnchor3_82" href="#Footnote3_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a></p>

 The remarks of Plotinus upon these four last-mentioned Categories are
prolix and vague, but many of them go to shew how much &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; is
involved in all of the four (Ennead. vi. 1, 14-18).</p></div>

 The following passages from Mr. James Mill (Analysis of the Phenomena
of the Human Mind, vol. ii. ch. xiv. sect. ii. pp. 48, 49, 56, 1st ed.)
state very clearly the Relativity of the predicates of Quantity and
Quality:— </p>
<p>
“It seems necessary that I should say something of the word <i>Quantus</i>, from which the word Quantity is derived. <i>Quantus</i> is the correlate of <i>Tantus</i>. <i>Tantus</i>, <i>Quantus</i>,
 are relative terms, applicable to all the objects to which we apply the
 terms Great, Little.” — “Of two lines, we call the one <i>tantus</i>, the other <i>quantus</i>. The occasions on which we do so, are when the one is as long as the other.” — “When we say that one thing is <i>tantus</i>, <i>quantus</i> another, or one so great, as the other is great; the first is referred to the last, the <i>tantus</i> to the <i>quantus</i>. The first is distinguished and named by the last. The <i>Quantus</i> is the standard.” — “On what account, then, is it that we give to any thing the name <i>Quantus</i>? As a standard by which to name another thing, <i>Tantus</i>. The thing called <i>Quantus</i> is the previously known thing, the ascertained amount, by which we can mark and define the other amount.”</p>
<p>
“<i>Talis</i>, <i>Qualis</i>, are applied to objects in the same way, on one account, as <i>Tantus</i>, <i>Quantus</i>, on another; and the explanation we gave of <i>Tantus</i>, <i>Quantus</i>, may be applied, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to the pair of relatives which we have now named. <i>Tantus</i>, <i>Quantus</i>, are names applied to objects on account of dimension. <i>Talis</i>, <i>Qualis</i>, are names applied to objects on account of all other sensations. We apply <i>Tantus</i>, <i>Quantus</i>, to a pair of objects when they are equal; we apply <i>Talis</i>, <i>Qualis</i>, to a pair of objects when they are alike. One of the objects is then the standard. The object <i>Qualis</i> is that to which the reference is made.”</p>
<p>
Compare the same work, vol. i. ch. ix. p. 225:— “The word <i>Such</i> is a relative term, and always connotes so much of the meaning of some other term. When we call a thing <i>such</i>, it is always understood that it is such <i>as</i> some other thing. Corresponding with our words <i>such as</i>, the Latins had <i>Talis</i>, <i>Qualis</i>.”</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>We thus see that all the predicates, not only under the Category which Aristotle terms <i>Ad Aliquid</i>,
 but also under all the last nine Categories, are relative. Indeed the
work of predication is always relative. The express purpose, as well as
the practical usefulness, of a significant predicate is, to carry the
mind of the hearer either to a comparison or to a general notion which
is the result of past comparisons. But though each predicate connotes
Relation, each connotes a certain <i>fundamentum</i> besides, which
gives to the Relation its peculiar character. Relations of Quantity are
not the same as relations of Quality; the predicates of the former
connote a <i>fundamentum</i> different from the predicates of the
latter, though in both the meaning conveyed is relative. In fact, every
predicate or concrete general name is relative, or connotes a Relation
to something else, actual or potential, beyond the thing named. The only
 name not relative is the Proper name, which connotes no attributes, and
 cannot properly be used as a predicate (so Aristotle remarks), but only
 as a Subject.<a name="FnAnchor3_83" href="#Footnote3_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> Sokrates, Kallias, Bukephalus &amp;c., denotes the <i>Hoc Aliquid</i> or <i>Unum Numero</i>,
 which, when pronounced alone, indicates some concrete aggregate (as yet
 unknown) which may manifest itself to my senses, but does not, so far
as the name is concerned, involve necessary reference to anything
besides; though even these names, when one and the same name continues
to be applied to the same object, may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>held to connote a real or supposed continuity of past or future existence, and become thus to a certain extent relative.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_83" id="Footnote3_83"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_83">83</a></span>
 You may make Sokrates a predicate, in the proposition, &#964;&#8056; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;
 &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;, but Aristotle dismisses this as an irregular or
perverse manner of speaking (see Analytic. Priora, i. p. 43, a. 35;
Analyt. Poster. i. p. 83, a. 2-16).</p>
<p>
Alexander calls these propositions &#945;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; (see Schol. ad Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>. p. 1017, a. 23).</p>
<p>
Mr. James Harris observes (Philosophical Arrangements, ch. x. p. 214;
also 317, 348):— “Hence too we may see why Relation stands next to
Quantity; for in strictness the Predicaments which follow are but
different modes of Relation, marked by some peculiar character over
their own, over and above the relative character, which is common to
them all.” To which I would add, that the first two Categories,
Substance and Quantity, are no less relative or correlative than the
eight later Categories; as indeed Harris himself thinks; see the same
work, pp. 90, 473: “Matter and Attribute are essentially distinct, yet,
like <i>convex</i> and <i>concave</i>, they are by nature inseparable.
We have already spoken as to the inseparability of attributes; we now
speak as to that of matter. &#7977;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#966;&#945;&#956;&#8050;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#963;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#964;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#964;’ &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; —
 &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#967;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957;, &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962; (Aristot. De Gen.
 et Corr. p. 329, a. 24). By contraries, Aristotle means here the
several attributes of matter, hot, cold, &amp;c.; from some one or other
 of which matter is always inseparable.”</p></div>
<p>
We must observe that what the proper name denotes is any certain concrete One and individual,<a name="FnAnchor3_84" href="#Footnote3_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>
 with his attributes essential and non-essential, whatever they may be,
though as yet undeclared, and with his capacity of receiving other
attributes different and even opposite. This is what Aristotle indicates
 as the most special characteristic of Substance or Essence, that while
it is <i>Unum et Idem Numero</i>, it is capable of receiving contraries. This potentiality of contraries, described as characterizing the <i>Unum et Idem Numero</i>,<a name="FnAnchor3_85" href="#Footnote3_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
 is relative to something about to come; the First Essence is doubtless
logically First, but it is just as much relative to the Second, as the
Second to the First. We know it only by two negations and one
affirmation, all of which are relative to predications <i>in futuro</i>.
 It is neither in a Subject, nor predicable of a Subject. It is itself
the ultimate Subject of all predications and all inherencies. Plainly,
therefore, we know it only relatively to these predications and
inherencies. Aristotle says truly, that if you take away the First
Essences, everything else, Second Essences as well as Accidents,
disappears along with them. But he might have added with equal truth,
that if you take away all Second Essences and all Accidents, the First
Essences will disappear equally. The correlation and interdependence is
reciprocal.<a name="FnAnchor3_86" href="#Footnote3_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a>
 It may be suitable, with a view to clear and retainable philosophical
explanation, to state the Subject first and the predicates afterwards;
so that the Subject may thus be considered as logically <i>prius</i>. But in truth the Subject is only a <i>substratum</i> for predicates,<a name="FnAnchor3_87" href="#Footnote3_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> as much as the predicates are <i>superstrata</i> upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>the Subject. The term <i>substratum</i> designates not an absolute or a <i>per se</i>, but a <i>Correlatum</i> to certain <i>superstrata</i>, determined or undetermined: now the <i>Correlatum</i>
 is one of the pair implicated directly or indirectly in all Relation;
and it is in fact specified by Aristotle as one variety of the Category <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_88" href="#Footnote3_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a>
 We see therefore that the idea of Relativity attaches to the first of
the ten Categories, as well as to the nine others. The inference from
these observations is, that Relation or Relativity, understood in the
large sense which really belongs to it, ought to be considered rather as
 an Universal, comprehending and pervading all the Categories, than as a
 separate Category in itself, co-ordinate with the other nine. It is the
 condition and characteristic of the work of predication generally; the
last analysis of which is into Subject and Predicate, in reciprocal
implication with each other. I remark that this was the view taken of it
 by some well-known Peripatetic commentators of antiquity;<a name="FnAnchor3_89" href="#Footnote3_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a>
 by Andronikus, for example, and by Ammonius after him. Plato, though he
 makes no attempt to draw up a list of Categories, has an incidental
passage respecting Relativity;<a name="FnAnchor3_90" href="#Footnote3_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a>
 conceiving it in a very extended sense, apparently as belonging more or
 less to all predicates. Aristotle, though in the Categoriæ he gives a
narrower explanation of it, founded upon grammatical rather than real
considerations, yet intimates in other places that predicates ranked
under the heads of <i>Quale</i>, <i>Actio</i>, <i>Passio</i>, <i>Jacere</i>, &amp;c., may also be looked at as belonging to the head of <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_91" href="#Footnote3_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a> This latter, moreover, he himself <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>declares elsewhere to be <i>Ens</i> in the lowest degree, farther removed from the <i>Prima Essentia</i> than any of the other Categories; to be more in the nature of an appendage to some of them, especially to <i>Quantum</i> and <i>Quale</i>;<a name="FnAnchor3_92" href="#Footnote3_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> and to presuppose, not only the <i>Prima Essentia</i>
 (which all the nine later Categories presuppose), but also one or more
of the others, indicating the particular mode of comparison or
Relativity in each case affirmed. Thus, under one aspect, Relation or
Relativity may be said to stand <i>prius naturâ</i>, and to come first
in order before all the Categories, inasmuch as it is implicated with
the whole business of predication (which those Categories are intended
to resolve into its elements), and belongs not less to the mode of
conceiving what we call the Subject, than to the mode of conceiving what
 we call its Predicates, each and all. Under another aspect, Relativity
may be said to stand last in order among the Categories — even to come
after the adverbial Categories <i>Ubi et Quando</i>; because its <i>locus standi</i>
 is dim and doubtful, and because every one of the subordinate
predicates belonging to it may be seen to belong to one or other of the
remaining Categories also. Aristotle remarks that the Category <i>Ad Aliquid</i> has no peculiar and definite mode of generation corresponding to it, in the manner that Increase and Diminution belong to <i>Quantum</i>, Change to <i>Quale</i>, Generation, simple and absolute, to Essence or Substance.<a name="FnAnchor3_93" href="#Footnote3_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a> New relations may become predicable of a thing, without any change in the thing itself, but simply by changes in other things.<a name="FnAnchor3_94" href="#Footnote3_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a></p>

characteristic mark of &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; is this very circumstance of being <i>unum numero</i>,

Mr. John Stuart Mill observes: “As to the self-existence of Substance,
it is very true that a substance may be conceived to exist without any
other substance; but so also may an attribute without any other
attributes. And we can no more imagine a substance without attributes,
than we can imagine attributes without a substance.” (System of Logic,
bk. i. ch. iii. p. 61, 6th ed.)</p></div>

 Hobbes observes (First Philosophy, part ii. ch. xi. 6): “But we must
not so think of Relation as if it were an accident differing from all
the other accidents of the relative; but one of them, namely, that by
which the comparison is made. For example, the likeness of one white to
another white, or its unlikeness to black, is the same accident with its
 whiteness.” This may be true about the relations Like and Unlike (see
Mr. John Stuart Mill, Logic, ch. iii. p. 80, 6th ed.) But, in Relations
generally, the <i>fundamentum</i> may be logically distinguished from the Relation itself. </p>
<p>
Aristotle makes the same remarks upon &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; as upon &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;:—
 That it verges upon Non-ens; and that it has no special mode of being
generated or destroyed. &#966;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#947;&#973;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#8052;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>Those among the Aristotelian commentators who denied the title of <i>Ad Aliquid</i> to a place among the Categories or <i>Summa Genera</i> of predicates, might support their views from passages where Aristotle ranks the Genus as a <i>Relatum</i>, though he at the same time declares that the Species under it are not <i>Relata.</i> Thus <i>scientia</i> is declared by him to be a <i>Relatum</i>; because it must be <i>of something—alicujus scibilis</i>; while the <i>something</i> thus implied is not specified.<a name="FnAnchor3_95" href="#Footnote3_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a> But (<i>scientia</i>) <i>musica</i>, <i>grammatica</i>, <i>medica</i>, &amp;c., are declared not to be <i>Relata</i>; the indeterminate <i>something</i> being there determined, and bound up in one word with the predication of Relativity. Now the truth is that both are alike <i>Relata</i>, though both also belong to the Category of Quality; a man is called <i>Talis</i> from being <i>sciens</i>, as well as from being <i>grammaticus</i>. Again, he gives as illustrative examples of the Category <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, the adjectives double, triple. But he ranks in a different Category (that of <i>Quantum</i>)
 the adjectives bicubital, tricubital (&#948;&#953;&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;, &#964;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;). It is plain
that the two last of these predicates are species under the two first,
and that all four predicates are alike relative, under any real
definition that can be given of Relativity, though all four belong also
to the Category of <i>Quantum</i>. Yet Aristotle does not recognize any predicates as belonging to <i>Ad Aliquid</i>,
 except such as are logically and grammatically elliptical; that is,
such as do not include in themselves the specification of the Correlate,
 but require to be supplemented by an additional word in the genitive or
 dative case, specifying the latter. As we have already seen, he lays it
 down generally, that all <i>Relata</i> (or <i>Ad Aliquid</i>) imply a <i>Correlatum</i>; and he prescribes that when the <i>Correlatum</i> is indicated, care shall be taken to designate it by a precise and specific term, not of wider import than the <i>Relatum</i>,<a name="FnAnchor3_96" href="#Footnote3_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> but specially reciprocating therewith: thus he regards <i>ala</i> (a wing) as <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, but when you specify its correlate in order to speak with propriety (&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#962;), you must describe it as <i>ala <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>alati</i> (not as <i>ala avis</i>), in order that the <i>Correlatum</i> may be strictly co-extensive and reciprocating with the <i>Relatum</i>. Wing, head, hand, &amp;c., are thus <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, though there may be no received word in the language to express their exact <i>Correlata</i>; and though you may find it necessary to coin a new word expressly for the purpose.<a name="FnAnchor3_97" href="#Footnote3_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> In specifying the <i>Correlatum</i> of servant, you must say, servant <i>of a master</i>,
 not servant of a man or of a biped; both of which are in this case
accompaniments or accidents of the master, being still accidents, though
 they may be in fact constantly conjoined. Unless you say master, the
terms will not reciprocate; take away master, the servant is no longer
to be found, though the man who was called <i>servant</i> is still there; but take away man or biped, and the servant may still continue.<a name="FnAnchor3_98" href="#Footnote3_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> You cannot know the <i>Relatum</i> determinately or accurately, unless you know the <i>Correlatum</i> also; without the knowledge of the latter, you can only know the former in a vague and indefinite manner.<a name="FnAnchor3_99" href="#Footnote3_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> Aristotle raises, also, the question whether any Essence or Substance can be described as <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_100" href="#Footnote3_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a>
 He inclines to the negative, though not decisively pronouncing. He
seems to think that Simo and Davus, when called men, are Essences or
Substances; but that when called master and slave, they are not so;
this, however, is surprising, when he had just before spoken of the
connotation of man as accidents (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;) belonging to the
connotation of master. He speaks of the members of an organized body
(wing, head, foot) as examples of <i>Ad Aliquid</i>; while in other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span> treatises, he determines very clearly that these members presuppose, as a <i>prius naturâ</i>,
 the complete organism whereof they are parts, and that the name of each
 member connotes the performance of, or aptitude to perform, a certain
special function: now, such aptitude cannot exist unless the whole
organism be held together in co-operative agency, so that if this last
condition be wanting, the names, head, eye, foot, can no longer be
applied to the separate members, or at least can only be applied
equivocally or metaphorically.<a name="FnAnchor3_101" href="#Footnote3_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> It would seem therefore that the functioning <i>something</i> is here the Essence, and that all its material properties are accidents (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;). </p>

<p>
This is not only just and useful in regard to accuracy of predication,
but deserves attention also in another point of view. In general, it
would be said that <i>man</i> and <i>biped</i> belonged to the Essence
(&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;); and the being a master to the Accidents or Accompaniments
(&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;). Here the case is reversed; man and biped are the
accidents or accompaniments; master is the Essence. What is connoted by
the term <i>master</i> is here the essential idea, that which is bound up with the idea connoted by <i>servant</i>; while the connotation of <i>man</i> or <i>biped</i>
 sinks into the character of an accessory or accompaniment. The master
might possibly not be a man, but a god; the Delphian Apollo (Euripid.
Ion, 132), and the Corinthian Aphrodité, had each many slaves belonging
to them. Moreover, even if every master were a man, the qualities
connoted by <i>man</i> are here accidental, as not being included in those connoted by the term master. Compare Metaphysica, <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>. p. 1025, a. 32; Topica, i. p. 102, a. 18.</p></div>

<p>
The doctrine enunciated in these passages is a very important one, in the Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
<p>
Trendelenburg (Kategorienlehre, p. 182) touches upon this confusion of the Categories, but faintly and partially.</p></div>
<p>
In the fourth book of the Metaphysica, Aristotle gives an explanation of <i>Ad Aliquid</i>
 different from, and superior to, that which we read in the Categoriæ;
treating it, not as one among many distinct Categories, but as
implicated with all the Categories, and taking a different character
according as it is blended with one or the other — <i>Essentia</i>, <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Quale</i>, <i>Actio</i>, <i>Passio</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchor3_102" href="#Footnote3_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a> He there, also, enumerates as one of the varieties of <i>Relata</i>,
 what seems to go beyond the limit, or at least beyond the direct
denotation, of the Categories; for, having specified, as one variety, <i>Relata Numero</i>, and, as another, <i>Relata secundum actionem et passionem</i> (&#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &amp;c.), he proceeds to a third variety, such as the <i>mensurabile</i> with reference to <i>mensura</i>, the <i>scibile</i> with reference to <i>scientia</i>, the <i>cogitabile</i> with reference to <i>cogitatio</i>; and in regard to this third variety, he draws a nice distinction. He says that <i>mensura</i> and <i>cogitatio</i> are <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, not because they are themselves related to <i>mensurabile</i> and <i>cogitabile</i>, but because <i>mensurabile</i> and <i>cogitabile</i> are related to them.<a name="FnAnchor3_103" href="#Footnote3_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a> You cannot say (he thinks) that <i>mensura</i> is referable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>to the <i>mensurabile</i>, or <i>cogitatio</i> to the <i>cogitabile</i>, because that would be repeating the same word twice over — <i>mensura est illius cujus est mensura</i> — <i>cogitatio est illius cujus est cogitatio.</i> So that he regards <i>mensura</i> and <i>cogitatio</i> as <i>Correlata</i>, rather than as <i>Relata</i>; while <i>mensurabile</i> and <i>cogitabile</i> are the <i>Relata</i>
 to them. But in point of fact, the distinction is not important; of the
 relative pair there may be one which is more properly called the <i>Correlatum</i>; yet both are alike relative.</p>

 p. 1020, b. 27-32. At the same time we must remark, that while
Aristotle enumerates &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; under &#928;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;, he
had just before (a. 25) ranked &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#957;, &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#949;&#8150;&#950;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;

 p. 1056, b. 34. Bonitz in his note (p. 262) remarks that the
distinction here drawn by Aristotle is not tenable; and I agree with him
 that it is not. But it coincides with what Aristotle asserts in other
words in the Categoriæ; viz., that to be <i>simul naturâ</i> is not true of <i>all</i>
 Relata, but only of the greater part of them; that &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; is
&#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, and &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;&#962;
(Categor. p. 7, b. 23; p. 8, a. 10). As I have mentioned before (<a href="#Footnote3_54">p. 71 n.</a>),
 Simplikius, in the Scholia (p. 65, b. 14), points out that Aristotle
has not been careful here to observe his own precept of selecting
&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#962; the correlative term. He ought to have stated the potential as
correlating with the potential, the actual with the actual. If he had
done this, the &#963;&#965;&#957;&#973;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#958;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; would have been seen to be true in
 all cases. Eudorus noticed a similar inadvertence of Aristotle in the
case of &#960;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#957; and &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#957; (Schol. 63, a. 43). See ‘Plato and the Other
 Companions of Sokrates,’ vol. ii. p. 330, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40437/40437-h/40437-h.htm#Footnotev3_28_21">note <sup>x</sup></a>. </p>
<p>
I transcribe a curious passage of Leibnitz, bearing on the same
question:—  “On réplique maintenant, que la vérité du mouvement est
indépendante de l’observation: et qu’un vaisseau peut avancer, sans que
celui qui est dedans s’en aperçoive. Je réponds, que le mouvement est
indépendant de l’observation: mais qu’il <i>n’est point indépendant de l’observabilité</i>. Il n’y a point de mouvement, quand il n’y a point de changement <i>observable</i>.
 Et même quand il n’y a point de changement observable, il n’y a point
de changement du tout. Le contraire est fondé sur la supposition d’un
Espace réel absolu, que j’ai réfuté demonstrativement par le principe du
 besoin d’une Raison suffisante des choses.” (Correspondence with
Clarke, p. 770. Erdmann’s edition.)</p></div>
<p>
If we compare together the various passages in which Aristotle cites and
 applies the Ten Categories (not merely in the treatise before us, but
also in the Metaphysica, Physica, and elsewhere), we shall see that he
cannot keep them apart steadily and constantly; that the same predicate
is referred to one head in one place, and to another head in another:
what is here spoken of as belonging to <i>Actio</i> or <i>Passio</i>, will be treated in another place as an instance of <i>Quale</i> or <i>Ad Aliquid</i>; even the derivative noun &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#962; (<i>habitus</i>) does not belong to the Category &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; (<i>Habere</i>), but sometimes to <i>Quale</i>, sometimes to <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_104" href="#Footnote3_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a>
 This is inevitable; for the predicates thus differently referred have
really several different aspects, and may be classified in one way or
another, according as you take them in this or that aspect. Moreover,
this same difficulty of finding impassable lines of demarcation would
still be felt, even if the Categories, instead of the full list of Ten,
were reduced to the smaller list of the four principal Categories —
Substance, Quantity, Quality, and Relation; a reduction which has been
recommended by commentators on Aristotle as well as by acute logicians
of modern times. Even these four cannot be kept clearly apart: the
predicates which declare Quantity or Quality must at the same time
declare or imply Relation; while the predicates which declare Relation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>must also imply the <i>fundamentum</i> either of Quantity or of Quality.<a name="FnAnchor3_105" href="#Footnote3_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a></p>

<p>The remarks made by Mr. John Stuart Mill (in his System of Logic,
book i. ch. iii.) upon the Aristotelian Categories, and the enlarged
philosophical arrangement which he introduces in their place, well
deserve to be studied. After enumerating the ten Predicaments, Mr. Mill
says:— “It is a mere catalogue of the distinctions rudely marked out by
the language of familiar life, with little or no attempt to penetrate,
by philosophic analysis, to the <i>rationale</i> even of these common
distinctions. Such an analysis would have shewn the enumeration to be
both redundant and defective. Some objects are omitted, and others
repeated several times under different heads.” (Compare the remarks of
the Stoic commentators, and Porphyry, Schol. p. 48, b. 10 Br.:
&#7936;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;, &#7970;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;. And Aristotle himself observes that the same
predicates might be ranked often under more than one head.) “That could
not be a very comprehensive view of the nature of Relation, which could
exclude action, passivity, and local situation from that category. The
same objection applies to the categories Quando (or position in time),
and Ubi (or position in space); <i>while the distinction between the latter and Situs </i>(&#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;)<i> is merely verbal</i>. The incongruity of erecting into a <i>summum genus</i>
 the tenth Category is manifest. On the other hand, the enumeration
takes no notice of any thing but Substances and Attributes. In what
Category are we to place sensations, or any other feelings and states of
 mind? as hope, joy, fear; sound, smell, taste; pain, pleasure; thought,
 judgment, conception, and the like? Probably all these would have been
placed by the Aristotelian school in the Categories of Actio and Passio;
 and the relation of such of them as are active, to their objects, and
of such of them as are passive, to their causes, would have been rightly
 so placed; but the things themselves, the feelings or states of mind,
wrongly. Feelings, or states of consciousness, are assuredly to be
counted among realities; but they cannot be reckoned either among
substances or among attributes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Among the many deficiencies of the Aristotelian Categories, as a
complete catalogue, there is none more glaring than the imperfect
conception of &#928;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; (the Relative), which Mr. Mill here points out.
But the Category &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (badly translated by commentators <i>Situs</i>,
 from which Aristotle expressly distinguishes it, Categor. p. 6, b. 12:
&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#7953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8134;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054; &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;) appears
to be hardly open to Mr. Mill’s remark, that it is only verbally
distinguished from &#928;&#959;&#8166;, <i>Ubi</i>. &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; is intended to mean <i>posture</i>, <i>attitude</i>,
 &amp;c. It is a reply to the question, In what posture is Sokrates?
Answer. — He is lying down, standing upright, kneeling, &#960;&#8058;&#958; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957;,
&amp;c. This is quite different from the question, Where is Sokrates? In
 the market-place, in the palæstra, &amp;c. &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (as Aristotle
himself admits, Categ. p. 6, b. 12) is not easily distinguished from
&#928;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;: for the abstract and general word <span class="gesp">&#952;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> (<i>position</i>) is reckoned by Aristotle under &#928;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;, though the <i>paronyma</i> &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#7953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8134;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; are affirmed not to be &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;, but to come under the separate Category <span class="gesp">&#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>. But &#922;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; is clearly distinguishable from &#928;&#959;&#8166; <i>Ubi</i>.</p>
<p>
Again, to Mr. Mill’s question, “In what Category are we to place
sensations or other states of mind — hope, fear, sound, smell, pain,
pleasure, thought, judgment,” &amp;c.? Aristotle would have replied (I
apprehend) that they come under the Category either of <i>Quale</i> or of <i>Pati</i>
 — &#928;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962; or &#928;&#940;&#952;&#951;. They are attributes or modifications of Man,
Kallias, Sokrates, &amp;c. If the condition of which we speak be
temporary or transitory, it is a &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;, and we speak of Kallias as
&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#953;; if it be a durable disposition or capacity likely to pass
into repeated manifestations, it is &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, and we describe Kallias as
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; (Categ. p. 9, a. 28-p. 10 a. 9). This equally applies to
mental and bodily conditions (&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8052;&#957;
&#960;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#951; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;. — p. 9, b. 33). The line is
dubious and difficult between &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962; and &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, but one or other of the
 two will comprehend all the mental states indicated by Mr. Mill.
Aristotle would not have admitted that “feelings are to be counted among
 realities,” except as they are now or may be the feelings of Kallias,
Sokrates, or some other <i>Hic Aliquis</i> — one or many. He would
consider feelings as attributes belonging to these &#928;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#927;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;; and so
 in fact Mr. Mill himself considers them (p. 83), after having specified
 the Mind (distinguished from Body or external object) as the Substance
to which they belong.</p>
<p>
Mr. Mill’s classification of Nameable Things is much better and more
complete than the Aristotelian Categories, inasmuch as it brings into
full prominence the distinction between the subjective and objective
points of view, and, likewise, the all-pervading principle of
Relativity, which implicates the two; whereas, Aristotle either confuses
 the one with the other, or conceives them narrowly and inadequately.
But we cannot say, I think, that Aristotle, in the Categories, assigns
no room for the mental states or elements. He has a place for them,
though he treats them altogether objectively. He takes account of <i>himself</i> only as an object — as one among the &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;, or individuals, along with Sokrates and Kallias.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>The most
 capital distinction, however, which is to be found among the Categories
 is that of Essence or Substance from all the rest. This is sometimes
announced as having a standing <i>per se</i>; as not only logically distinguishable, but really separable from the other nine, if we preserve the Aristotelian list of ten,<a name="FnAnchor3_106" href="#Footnote3_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a> or from the other three, if we prefer the reduced list of four. But such real separation cannot be maintained. The <i>Prima Essentia</i>
 (we are told) is indispensable as a Subject, but cannot appear as
Predicate; while all the rest can and do so appear. Now we see that this
 definition is founded upon the function enacted by each of them in
predication, and therefore presupposes the fact of predication, which is
 in itself a Relation. The Category of Relation is thus implied, in
declaring what the First Essence is, together with some <i>predicabilia</i> as correlates, though it is not yet specified what the <i>predicabilia</i>
 are. But besides this, the distinction drawn by Aristotle, between
First and Second Essence or Substance, abolishes the marked line of
separation between Substance and Quality, making the former shade down
into the latter. The distinction recognizes a more or less in Substance,
 which graduation Aristotle expressly points out, stating that the
Species is <i>more</i> Substance or Essence, and that Genus <i>less</i> so. We see thus that he did not conceive Substance (apart from attributes) according to the modern view, as that which exists <i>without</i> the mind (excluding <i>within</i> the mind or <i>relation</i>
 to the mind); for in that there can be no graduation. That which is
without the mind, must also be within; and that which is within must
also be without; the subject and the object correlating. This
implication of within and without understood, there is then room for
graduation, according as the one or the other aspect may be more or less
 prominent. Aristotle, in point of fact, confines himself to the mental
or logical work of predication, to the conditions thereof, and to the
component terms whereby the mind accomplishes that act. When he speaks
of the First Essence or Substance, without the Second, all that he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>can say about it positively is to call it <i>Unum numero</i> and indivisible:<a name="FnAnchor3_107" href="#Footnote3_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a>
 even thus, he is compelled to introduce unity, measure, and number, all
 of which belong to the two Categories of Quantity and Relation; and yet
 still the First Essence or Substance remains indeterminate. We only
begin to determine it when we call it by the name of the Second
Substance or Essence; which name connotes certain attributes, the
attributes thus connoted being of the essence of the Species; that is,
unless they be present, no individual would be considered as belonging
to the Species, or would be called by the specific name.<a name="FnAnchor3_108" href="#Footnote3_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> When we thus, however, introduce attributes, we find ourselves not merely in the Category of <i>Substantia</i> (<i>Secunda</i>), but also in that of <i>Qualitas</i>. The boundary between <i>Substantia</i> and <i>Qualitas</i>
 disappears; the latter being partially contained in the former. The
Second Substance or Essence includes attributes or Qualities belonging
to the Essence. In fact, the Second Substance or Essence, when
distinguished from the First, is both here and elsewhere characterized
by Aristotle, as being not Substance at all, but Quality,<a name="FnAnchor3_109" href="#Footnote3_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a>
 though when considered as being in implication with the First, it takes
 on the nature of Substance and becomes substantial or essential
Quality. The Differentia belongs thus both to Substance and to Quality (<i>quale quid</i>), making up as complement that which is designated by the specific name.<a name="FnAnchor3_110" href="#Footnote3_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a></p>

The remarks of the different expositors (contained in Scholia, pp. 52,
53, 54, Brand.), are interesting upon the ambiguous position of
Differentia, in regard to Substance and Quality. It comes out to be
Neither and Both — &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#941;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; (Plato, Euthydemus, p. 300 C.).
 Dexippus and Porphyry called it something intermediate between &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;
and &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, or between &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; and &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>We see,
accordingly, that neither is the line of demarcation between the
Category of Substance or Essence and the other Categories so impassable,
 nor the separability of it from the others so marked as some thinkers
contend. Substance is represented by Aristotle as admitting of more and
less, and as graduating by successive steps down to the other
Categories; moreover, neither in its complete manifestation (as First
Substance), nor in its incomplete manifestation (as Second Substance),
can it be explained or understood without calling in the other
Categories of Quantity, Quality, and Relation. It does not correspond to
 the definition of <i>Substantia</i> given by Spinoza — “<i>quod in se est et per se concipitur</i>.”
 It can no more be conceived or described without some of the other
Categories, than they can be conceived or described without it.
Aristotle defines it by four characteristics, two negative, and two
positive. It cannot be predicated of a Subject: it cannot inhere in a
Subject: it is, at bottom, the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Subiect'">Subject</span> of all Predicates: it is <i>Unum numero</i> and indivisible.<a name="FnAnchor3_111" href="#Footnote3_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a>
 Not one of these four determinations can be conceived or understood,
unless we have in our minds the idea of other Categories and its
relation to them. Substance is known only as the Subject of predicates,
that is, relatively to them; as they also are known relatively to it.
Without the Category of Relation, we can no more understand what is
meant by a Subject than what is meant by a Predicate. The Category of
Substance, as laid out by Aristotle, neither exists by itself, nor can
be conceived by itself, without that of Relation and the generic notion
of Predicate.<a name="FnAnchor3_112" href="#Footnote3_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a> All three lie <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>together at the bottom of the analytical process, as the last findings and residuum. </p>

&#945;&#8017;&#964;&#940;, in the Analytic. Post. I. iv. p. 73, a. 34, b. 13. According to

<p>
M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, in the valuable Preface introducing his
translation of the Organon, gives what I think a just view of the
Categories generally, and especially of &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, as simply naming (<i>i.e.</i> giving a proper name), and doing nothing more. I transcribe the passage, merely noting that the terms <i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior</i> can mean nothing more than <i>logical</i> anteriority and posteriority.</p>

“Mais comment classer les mots? — C’est à la réalité seule qu’il faut le
 demander; à la réalité dont le langage n’est que le réflet, dont les
mots ne sont que le symbole. Que nous présente la réalité? Des
individus, rien que des individus, existant par eux-mêmes, et se
groupant, par leurs ressemblances et leurs différences, sous des espèces
 et sous des genres. Ainsi donc, en étudiant l’individu, l’être
individuel, et en analysant avec exactitude tout ce qu’il est possible
d’en dire en tant qu’être, on aura les classes les plus générales des
mots; les catégories, ou pour prendre le terme français, les
attributions, qu’il est possible de lui appliquer. Voilà tout le
fondement des Catégories. — Ce n’est pas du reste, une classification
des choses à la manière de celles de l’histoire naturelle, qu’il s’agit
de faire en logique: c’est une simple énumération de tous les points de
vue, d’<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ou'">où</span>
l’esprit peut considérer les choses, non pas, il est vrai, par rapport à
 l’esprit lui-même, mais par rapport à leur réalité et à leurs
appellations. — Aristote distingue ici dix points de vue, dix
significations principales des mots. — La Catégorie de la Substance est à
 la tête de toutes les autres, précisément parceque la première, la plus
 essentielle, marque d’un être, c’est d’être. Cela revient <span class="correction" title="amended from 'a'">à</span>
 dire qu’avant tout, l’être est, l’être existe. Par suite les mots qui
expriment la substance sont antérieurs à tous les autres et sont les
plus importants. Il faut ajouter que ces mots là participeront en
quelque sorte à cet isolement que les individus nous offrent dans la
nature. Mais de même que, dans la réalité, les individus subsistant par
eux seuls forment des espèces et des genres, qui ont bien aussi une
existence substantielle, la substance se divisera de même en substance
première et substance seconde. — Les espèces et les genres, s’ils
expriment la substance, ne l’expriment pas dans toute sa pureté; c’est <span class="correction" title="amended from 'déja'">déjà</span>
 de la substance qualifié, comme le dit Aristote. — Il n’y a bien dans
la réalité que des individus et des espèces ou genres. Mais ces
individus en soi et pour soi n’existent pas seulement; ils existent sous
 certaines conditions; leur existence se produit sous certaines
modifications, que les mots expriment aussi, tout comme ils expriment
l’existence absolue. Ces nouvelles classes de mots formeront les autres
Catégories. — Ces modifications, ces accidents, de l’individu sont au
nombre de neuf: Aristote n’en reconnaît pas davantage. — <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Voila dont'">Voilà donc</span> les dix Catégories: les dix seules attributions possibles. <i>Par la première, on nomme les individus, sans faire plus que les nommer: par les autres, on les qualifie.</i>
 On dit d’abord ce qu’est l’individu, et ensuite quel il est.”

<p>
Aristotle, taking his departure from an analysis of the complete
sentence or of the act of predication, appears to have regarded the
Subject as having a natural priority over the Predicate. The
noun-substantive (which to him represents the Subject), even when
pronounced alone, carries to the hearer a more complete conception than
either the adjective or the verb when pronounced alone; these make
themselves felt much more as elliptical and needing complementary
adjuncts. But this is only true in so far as the conception, raised by
the substantive named alone (&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8134;&#962;), includes by anticipation
what would be included, if we added to it some or all of its predicates.
 If we could deduct from this conception the meaning of all the
applicable predicates, it would seem essentially barren or incomplete,
awaiting something to come; a mere point of commencement or departure,<a name="FnAnchor3_113" href="#Footnote3_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a> known only by the various lines which may be drawn from it; a <i>substratum</i> for various attributes to lie upon or to inhere in. That which is known only as a <i>substratum</i>, is known only relatively to a superstructure to come; the one is <i>Relatum</i>, the other <i>Correlatum</i>,
 and the mention of either involves an implied assumption of the other.
There may be a logical priority, founded upon expository convenience,
belonging to the <i>substratum</i>, because it remains numerically one
and the same, while the superstructure is variable. But the priority is
nothing more than logical and notional; it does not amount to an ability
 of prior independent existence. On the contrary, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>there is simultaneity <i>by nature</i>
 (according to Aristotle’s own definition of the phrase) between
Subject, Relation, and Predicate; since they all imply each other as
reciprocating correlates, while no one of them is the cause of the
others.<a name="FnAnchor3_114" href="#Footnote3_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a></p>

When Aristotle says, very truly, that if the First Substances were
non-existent, none of the other Predicaments could exist, we must
understand what he means by the term <i>first</i>. That term bears, in
this treatise, a sense different from what it bears elsewhere: here it
means the extreme concrete and individual; elsewhere it means the
extreme abstract and universal. The First Substance or First Essence, in
 the Categories, is a <i>Hoc Aliquid</i> (&#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;), illustrated by the examples <i>hic homo</i>, <i>hic equus</i>.
 Now, as thus explained and illustrated, it includes not merely the
Second Substance, but various accidental attributes besides. When we
talk of This man, Sokrates, Kallias, &amp;c., the hearer conceives not
only the attributes for which he is called a man, but also various
accidental attributes, ranking under one or more of the other
Predicaments. The First Substance thus (as explained by Aristotle) is
not conceived as a mere <i>substratum</i> without Second Substance and
without any Accidents, but as already including both of them, though as
yet indeterminately; it waits for specializing words, to determine what
its Substance or Essence is, and what its accompanying Accidents are.
Being an individual (<i>Unum numero</i>), it unites in itself both the essential attributes of its species, and the unessential attributes peculiar to itself.<a name="FnAnchor3_115" href="#Footnote3_115"><span class="sp">115</span></a> It is already understood as including attributes of both kinds; but we wait for predicates to declare (&#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957; — &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#953;<a name="FnAnchor3_116" href="#Footnote3_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a>) what these attributes are. The First or Complete <i>Ens</i>
 embodies in itself all the Predicaments, though as yet potential and
indeterminate, until the predicating adjuncts are specified. There is no
 priority, in the order of existence, belonging to Substance over
Relation or Quality; take away either one of the three, and the First <i>Ens</i>
 disappears. But in regard to the order of exposition, there is a
natural priority, founded on convenience and facility of understanding.

 a certain concretion or co-existence of attributes, though we do not
yet know what they are — being as it were a skeleton — comes naturally
as Subject before the predicates, whose function is declaratory and
specifying as to those attributes: moreover, the essential attributes,
which are declared and connoted when we first bestow a specific name on
the subject, come naturally before the unessential attributes, which are
 predicated of the subject already called by a specific name connoting
other attributes.<a name="FnAnchor3_117" href="#Footnote3_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a> The essential characters are native and at home; the accidental attributes are domiciliated foreigners.<a name="FnAnchor3_118" href="#Footnote3_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a></p>

<p>
It is thus that Aristotle has dealt with Ontology, in one of the four
distinct aspects thereof, which he distinguishes from each other; that
is, in the distribution of <i>Entia</i> according to their logical order, and the reciprocal interdependence, in predication. <i>Ens</i>
 is a multivocal word, neither strictly univocal nor altogether
equivocal. It denotes (as has been stated above) not a generic
aggregate, divisible into species, but an analogical aggregate, starting
 from one common terminus and ramifying into many derivatives, having no
 other community except that of relationship to the same terminus.<a name="FnAnchor3_119" href="#Footnote3_119"><span class="sp">119</span></a> The different modes of <i>Ens</i> are distinguished by the degree or variety of such relationship. The <i>Ens Primum</i>, <i>Proprium</i>, <i>Completum</i>,
 is (in Aristotle’s view) the concrete individual; with a defined
essence or essential constituent attributes (&#964;&#943; &#7973;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;), and with
unessential accessories or accidents also — all embodied and implicated
in the One <i>Hoc Aliquid</i>. In the Categoriæ Aristotle analyses this <i>Ens Completum</i>
 (not metaphysically, into Form and Matter, as we shall find him doing
elsewhere, but) logically into Subject and Predicates. In this logical
analysis, the Subject which can never be a Predicate stands first; next,
 come the near kinsmen, Genus and Species (expressed by substantive
names, as the First Substance is), which are sometimes Predicates — as
applied to <i>Substantia Prima</i>, sometimes Subjects — in regard to the extrinsic accompaniments or accidents;<a name="FnAnchor3_120" href="#Footnote3_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a> in the third rank, come the more remote kinsmen, Predicates pure and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>simple. These are the logical factors or constituents into which the <i>Ens Completum</i>
 may be analysed, and which together make it up as a logical sum-total.
But no one of these logical constituents has an absolute or independent <i>locus standi</i>,
 apart from the others. Each is relative to the others; the Subject to
its Predicates, not less than the Predicates to their Subject. It is a
mistake to describe the Subject as having a real standing separately and
 alone, and the Predicates as something afterwards tacked on to it. The
Subject <i>per se</i> is nothing but a general potentiality or
receptivity for Predicates to come; a relative general conception, in
which the two, Predicate and Subject, are jointly implicated as <i>Relatum</i> and <i>Correlatum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_121" href="#Footnote3_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a></p>

Metaphys. <span class="smcap">Z</span>. p. 1033, b. 24), which illustrates pertinently the relation between Predicate and Subject, the <i>logical</i> constituents of the same &#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;. He observes (not. p. 327, <span class="correction" title="amended from 'ad.'">ad</span> Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">Z</span>.
 p. 1033, b. 19). “Quoniam ex duabus substantiis, quæ quidem actu sint,
nunquam una existit substantia, si et formam et materiem utrumque per se
 esse poneremus, nunquam ex utroque existeret res definita ac
sensibilis, &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;. Ponendum potius, si recte assequor Aristotelis
sententiam, utrumque (Form and Matter) ita ut alterum exspectet, materia
 ut formæ definitionem, forma ut materiam definiendam, exspectet, neutra
 vero per se et absolute sit.” What Bonitz says here about Matter and
Form is no less true about Subject and Predicate: each is relative to
the other — neither of them is absolute or independent of the other. In
fact, the explanation given by Aristotle of <i>Materia</i> (Metaph. <span class="smcap">Z</span>. p. 1028, b. 36) coincides very much with the <i>Prima Essentia</i> of the Categories, if abstracted from the <i>Secunda Essentia</i>. <i>Materia</i>

<p>
Aristotle proceeds to say that this Subject — the Subject for all
Predicates, but never itself a Predicate — cannot be the genuine &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;,
which must essentially be &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; (p. 1029, a. 28), and
which must have a &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; (1029, b. 2). The Subject is in fact not
true &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, but is one of the constituent elements thereof, being
relative to the Predicates as <i>Correlata</i>: it is the potentiality for Predicates generally, as <i>Materia</i> is the potentiality for Forms.</p></div>
<p>
The logical aspect of Ontology, analysing <i>Ens</i> into a common
Subject with its various classes of Predicates, appears to begin with
Aristotle. He was, as far as we can see, original, in taking as the
point of departure for his theory, the individual man, horse, or other
perceivable object; in laying down this Concrete Particular with all its
 outfit of details, as the type of <i>Ens</i> proper, complete and primary; and in arranging into classes the various secondary modes of <i>Ens</i>,
 according to their different relations to the primary type and the mode
 in which they contributed to make up its completeness. He thus stood
opposed to the Pythagoreans and Platonists, who took their departure
from the Universal, as the type of full and true Entity;<a name="FnAnchor3_122" href="#Footnote3_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a> while he also <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>dissented from Demokritus, who recognized no true <i>Ens</i>
 except the underlying, imperceptible, eternal atoms and vacuum.
Moreover Aristotle seems to have been the first to draw up a logical
analysis of Entity in its widest sense, as distinguished from that
metaphysical analysis which we read in his other works; the two not
being contradictory, but distinct and tending to different purposes.
Both in the one and in the other, his principal controversy seems to
have been with the Platonists, who disregarded both individual objects
and accidental attributes; dwelling upon Universals, Genera and Species,
 as the only real <i>Entia</i> capable of being known. With the
Sophists, Aristotle contends on a different ground, accusing them of
neglecting altogether the essential attributes, and confining themselves
 to the region of accidents, in which no certainty was to be found;<a name="FnAnchor3_123" href="#Footnote3_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a>
 in Plato, he points out the opposite mistake, of confining himself to
the essentials, and ascribing undue importance to the process of generic
 and specific subdivision.<a name="FnAnchor3_124" href="#Footnote3_124"><span class="sp">124</span></a>
 His own logical analysis takes account both of the essential and
accidental, and puts them in what he thinks their proper relation. The
Accidental (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;, concomitant, <i>i.e.</i> of the essence) is <i>per se</i>
 not knowable at all (he contends), nor is ever the object of study
pursued in any science; it is little better than a name, designating the
 lowest degree of <i>Ens</i>, bordering on <i>Non-Ens</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_125" href="#Footnote3_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a>
 It is a term comprehending all that he includes under his nine last

nine is here treated as a <i>Summum Genus</i>, having its own mode of
relationship, and clinging by its own separate thread to the Subject. He
 acknowledges the Accidents in his classification, not as a class by
themselves, but as subordinated to the Essence, and, as so many threads

frequently and usually talks of &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;, though he sometimes uses it
to include also a constant and inseparable accompaniment or Accident, if
 it be not included in the Essence (<i>i. e.</i> not connoted by the
specific name); thus, to have the three angles equal to two right angles

It is that which is by its nature irregular and unpredictable. See the
valuable chapter (ii) in Brentano, Von der Bedeutung des Seienden nach
Aristoteles (pp. 8-21), in which the meaning of &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; in
Aristotle is clearly set forth.</p></div>
<p>
In discriminating and arranging the Ten Categories, Trendelenburg
supposes that Aristotle was guided, consciously or unconsciously, by
grammatical considerations, or by a distinction among the parts of
speech. It should be remembered that what are now familiarly known as
the eight parts of speech, had not yet been distinguished or named in
the time of Aristotle, nor did the distinction come into vogue before
the time of the Stoic and Alexandrine grammarians, more than a century
after him. <i>Essentia</i> or <i>Substantia</i>, the first Category, answers (so Trendelenburg thinks<a name="FnAnchor3_128" href="#Footnote3_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a>) to the Substantive; <i>Quantum</i> and <i>Quale</i> represent the Adjective; <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, the comparative Adjective, of which <i>Quantum</i> and <i>Quale</i> are the positive degree; <i>Ubi</i> and <i>Quando</i> the Adverb; <i>Jacere</i>, <i>Habere</i>, <i>Agere</i>, <i>Pati</i> the Verb. Of the last four, <i>Agere</i> and <i>Pati</i> correspond to the active and passive voices of the Verb; <i>Jacere</i> to the neuter or intransitive Verb; and <i>Habere</i> to the peculiar meaning of the Greek perfect — the present result of a past action.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote3_128" id="Footnote3_128"></a><a href="#FnAnchor3_128">128</a></span> Trendelenburg, Kategorienlehre, pp. 23, 211.</p></div>
<p>
This general view, which Trendelenburg himself conceives as having been
only guiding and not decisive or peremptory in the mind of Aristotle,<a name="FnAnchor3_129" href="#Footnote3_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a>
 appears to me likely and plausible, though Bonitz and others have
strongly opposed it. We see from Aristotle’s own language, that the
grammatical point of view had great effect upon his mind; that the form (<i>e.g.</i>)
 of a substantive implied in his view a mode of signification belonging
to itself, which was to be taken into account in arranging and
explaining the Categories.<a name="FnAnchor3_130" href="#Footnote3_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a> I apprehend that Aristotle was induced to distinguish and set out his Categories by analysing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>various
 complete sentences, which would of course include substantives,
adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. It is also remarkable that Aristotle
should have designated his four last Categories by the indication of
verbs, the two immediately preceding by adverbs, the second and third by
 adjectives, and the first by a substantive. There remains the important
 Category <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, which has no part of speech corresponding
to it specially. Even this Category, though not represented by any part
of speech, is nevertheless conceived and defined by Aristotle in a very
narrow way, with close reference to the form of expression, and to the
requirement of a noun immediately following, in the genitive or dative
case. And thus, where there is no special part of speech, the mind of
Aristotle still seems to receive its guidance from grammatical and
syntactic forms. </p>

We may illustrate the ten Categories of Aristotle by comparing them with
 the four Categories of the Stoics. During the century succeeding
Aristotle’s death, the Stoics, Zeno and Chrysippus (principally the
latter), having before them what he had done, proposed a new arrangement
 for the complete distribution of Subject and Predicates. Their
distribution was quadruple instead of decuple. Their first Category was
&#964;&#943;, <i>Aliquid</i> or <i>Quiddam</i> — &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, the <i>Substratum</i> or Subject. Their second was &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, <i>Quale</i> or Quality. Their third was &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;, <i>certo Modo se habens</i>. Their fourth was, &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;, <i>Ad Aliquid certo Modo se habens</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_131" href="#Footnote3_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a></p>

&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;.</p>
<p>
It would seem from the adverse criticisms of Plotinus, that the Stoics recognized one grand <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#955;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;'">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>
 comprehending all the above four as distinct species: see Plotinus,
Ennead., vi. 2, 1; vi. 1, 25. He charges them with inconsistency and
error for doing so. He admits, however, that Aristotle did not recognize
 any one supreme &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; comprehending all the ten Categories (vi. 1, 1),
but treated all the ten as &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;, under an analogous aggregate. I
cannot but think that the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Stoic'">Stoics</span>
 looked upon their four &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951; in the same manner; for I do not see what
they could find more comprehensive to rank generically above &#964;&#943;.</p></div>
<p>
We do not possess the advantage (which we have in the case of Aristotle)
 of knowing this quadruple scheme as stated and enforced by its authors.
 We know it only through the abridgment of Diogenes Laertius, together
with incidental remarks and criticisms, chiefly adverse, by Plutarch,
Sextus Empiricus, Plotinus, and some Aristotelian commentators. As far
as we can make out upon this evidence, it appears that the first Stoic
Category corresponded with the &#928;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#927;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, First Essence or Substance
of Aristotle. It was exclusively Subject, and could <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>never
 become Predicate; but it was indispensable as Subject, to the three
other Predicates. Its meaning was concrete and particular; for we are

 from this Category,<a name="FnAnchor3_132" href="#Footnote3_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> and were designated as &#927;&#8020;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;, Non-Individuals, or Non-Particulars. <i>Homo</i> was counted by them, not under the Category &#964;&#943;, <i>Quid</i>, but under the Category <span class="gesp">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;</span>, <i>Quale</i>; in its character of predicate determining the Subject &#964;&#943;&#962; or &#964;&#943;. The Stoic Category <i>Quale</i> thus included the Aristotelian Second Essences or Substances, and also the Aristotelian <i>differentia</i>. <i>Quale</i> was a <i>species</i>-making Category (&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#962;).<a name="FnAnchor3_133" href="#Footnote3_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a>
 It declared what was the Essence of the Subject &#964;&#943; — the essential
qualities or attributes, but also the derivative manifestations thereof,
 coinciding with what is called the <i>proprium</i> in Porphyry’s
Eisagoge. It therefore came next in order immediately after &#964;&#943;: since
the Essence of the Subject must be declared, before you proceed to
declare its Accidents.</p>

 Trendelenburg, Kategorienlehre p. 222; Plutarch, De Stoicor.
Repugnantiis, p. 1054 a.; Simpl. ad Categor. Schol. p. 67. Br. &#928;&#959;&#953;&#8048; were
 distributed by the Stoics into three varieties; and the abstract word
&#928;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, in the Stoic sense, corresponded only to the highest and most
complete of these three varieties, not to the second or third variety,
so that &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; had a narrower extension than &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;: there were &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8048;
without any &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#964;&#8052;&#962; corresponding to them. To the third Category, &#928;&#8060;&#962;
&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, which was larger and more varied than the second, they had no
abstract term corresponding; nor to the fourth Category, &#928;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;. Hence,
 we may see one reason why the Stoics, confining the abstract term
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962; to durable attributes, were disposed to maintain that the
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; were themselves &#963;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; or &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;: which Galen
takes much pains to refute (vol. xix. p. 463, seq. ed. Kuhn). The Stoics
 considered these qualities as &#7936;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#940;&#962;, or &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, &amp;c.,
spiritual or gaseous agents pervading and holding together the solid
substance.</p>
<p>
It is difficult to make out these Stoic theories clearly from the
evidence before us. From the statements of Simplikius in Scholia, pp.
67-69, I cannot understand the line of distinction between &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8048; and &#960;&#8060;&#962;
&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;. The Stoics considered &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; to be &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;
&#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#8033;&#962; &#7969; &#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#949; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#962;
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (p. 69, b. 2); and if all these &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; were included
under &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, so that &#8001; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#8182;&#957;, &#8001; &#960;&#8058;&#958; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957; and &#8001; &#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#969;&#957;,
 were &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962; (p. 67, b. 34). I hardly see what was left for the
third Category &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; to comprehend; although, according to the
indications of Plotinus, it would be the most comprehensive. The Stoic
writers seem both to have differed among themselves and to have written
inconsistently.</p>
<p>
Neither Trendelenburg (Kategorienlehre, pp. 223-226), nor even Prantl,
in his more elaborate account (Gesch. der Logik, pp. 429-437), clears up
 this obscurity.</p></div>
<p>
The Third Stoic Category (&#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;) comprised a portion of what Aristotle ranked under <i>Quale</i>, and all that he ranked under <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Ubi</i>, <i>Quando</i>, <i>Agere</i>, <i>Pati</i>, <i>Jacere</i>, <i>Habere</i>. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>fourth Stoic Category coincided with the Aristotelian <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.
 The third was thus intended to cover what were understood as absolute
or non-relative Accidents; the fourth included what were understood as
Relative Accidents.</p>
<p>
The order of arrangement among the four was considered as fixed and
peremptory. They were not co-ordinate species under one and the same
genus, but superordinate and subordinate,<a name="FnAnchor3_134" href="#Footnote3_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a> the second presupposing and attaching to the first; the third, presupposing and attaching to the first, <i>plus</i> the second; the fourth, presupposing and attaching to the first, <i>plus</i> the second and third. The first proposition to be made is, in answer to the question <i>Quale Quid</i>? You answer <i>Tale Aliquid</i>, declaring the essential attributes. Upon this, the next question is put, <i>Quali Modo se habens</i>? You answer by a term of the third Category, declaring one or more of the accidental attributes non-relative, <i>Tale Aliquid, tali Modo se habens</i>. Upon this, the fourth and last question follows, <i>Quali Modo se habens ad alia</i>? Answer is made by the predicate of the fourth Category, <i>i.e.</i> a Relative. <i>Hic Aliquis — homo</i> (1), <i>niger</i> (2), <i>servus</i> (3).</p>

Categor. fol. 43, A: &#954;&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959; &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#7952;&#954;

Cf.
Plotinus, Ennead. vi. 1, 25-29.</p>
<p>
Porphyry appears to include all &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945; under &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; and &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;: he
 gives as examples of the latter, what Aristotle would have assigned to
the Category &#954;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (Eisagoge, cc. 2, 10; Schol. Br. p. 1, b. 32, p. 5,
 a. 30).</p></div>
<p>
In comparing the ten Aristotelian with the four Stoic Categories we see
that the first great difference is in the extent and comprehension of <i>Quale</i>, which Aristotle restricts on one side (by distinguishing from it <i>Essentia Secunda</i>),
 and enlarges on the other (by including in it many attributes
accidental and foreign to the Essence). The second difference is, that
the Stoics did not subdivide their third Category, but included therein
all the matter of six Aristotelian Categories,<a name="FnAnchor3_135" href="#Footnote3_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a> and much of the matter of the Aristotelian <i>Quale</i>.
 Both schemes agree on two points:— 1. In taking as the point of
departure the concrete, particular, individual, Substance. 2. In the
narrow, restricted, inadequate conception formed of the Relative — <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.</p>

 Plotinus (Ennead. vi. 1. 80) disapproves greatly the number of
disparates ranked under &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;, which has (he contends) no
discoverable unity as a generic term. It is curious to see how he cites
the Aristotelian Categories, as if the decuple distinction which they
marked out were indefeasible.</p>
<p>
Simplikius says that the Stoics distinguished between &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; and &#964;&#8056;
&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;; and Trendelenburg, (pp. 228, 229) explains and
illustrate this distinction, which, however, appears to be very obscure.</p></div>
<p>
Plotinus himself recognizes five <i>Summa</i> or <i>Prima Genera</i>,<a name="FnAnchor3_136" href="#Footnote3_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a> (he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>does not call them Categories) <i>Ens</i>, <i>Motus</i>, <i>Quies</i>, <i>Idem</i>, <i>Diversum</i>; the same as those enumerated in the Platonic Sophistes. He does not admit <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Quale</i>, or <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, to be <i>Prima Genera</i>;
 still less the other Aristotelian Categories. Moreover, he insists
emphatically on the distinction between the intelligible and the
sensible world, which distinction he censures Aristotle for neglecting.
His five <i>Genera</i> he applies directly and principally to the intelligible world. For the sensible world he admits ultimately five Catgories; <i>Substantia</i> or <i>Essentia</i> (though he conceives this as fluctuating between Form, Matter, and the Compound of the two), <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Quale</i>, <i>Motus</i>. But he doubts whether <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Quale</i>, and <i>Motus</i>, are not comprehended in <i>Ad Aliquid</i>.<a name="FnAnchor3_137" href="#Footnote3_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a>
 He considers, moreover, that Sensible Substance is not Substance,
properly speaking, but only an imitation thereof; a congeries of
non-substantial elements, qualities and matter.<a name="FnAnchor3_138" href="#Footnote3_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a> Dexippus,<a name="FnAnchor3_139" href="#Footnote3_139"><span class="sp">139</span></a>
 in answering the objections of Plotinus, insists much on the difference
 between Aristotle’s point of view in the Categoriæ, in the Physica, and
 in the Metaphysica. In the Categoriæ, Aristotle dwells mainly on
sensible substances (such as the vulgar understand) and the modes of
naming and describing them.</p>

 The second and third books of Dexippus’s Dialogue contain his answers
to many of the objections urged by Plotinus. Aristotle, in the Categoriæ
 (Dexippus says), accommodates himself both to the received manner of
speaking and to the simple or ordinary conception of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; entertained
by youth or unphilosophical men — &#959;&#8020;&#964;&#949; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#959;&#8020;&#964;&#949; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

50-54, where Dexippus contrasts the more abstruse handling which we read

Galen also recognizes five Categories; but not the same five as
Plotinus. He makes a new list, formed partly out of the Aristotelian
ten, partly out of the Stoic four:— &#927;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, &#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;, &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, <span class="gesp">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;</span>, &#960;&#961;&#972; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#8060;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;.<a name="FnAnchor3_140" href="#Footnote3_140"><span class="sp">140</span></a></p>

The latter portion of this Aristotelian treatise, on the Categories or Predicaments, consists of an Appendix, usually known <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>under the title of ‘Post-Predicamenta;’<a name="FnAnchor3_141" href="#Footnote3_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a> wherein the following terms or notions are analysed and explained — <i>Opposita</i>, <i>Prius</i>, <i>Simul</i>, <i>Motus</i>, <i>Habere</i>.</p>

 Andronikus and other commentators supposed the Post-Predicamenta to
have been appended to the Categoriæ by some later hand. Most of the
commentators dissented from this view. The distinctions and explanations
 seem all Aristotelian.</p></div>
<p>
Of <i>Opposita</i>, Aristotle reckons four modes, analogous to each other, yet not different species under the same genus:<a name="FnAnchor3_142" href="#Footnote3_142"><span class="sp">142</span></a> — 1. <i>Relative-Opposita</i> — <i>Relatum</i> and <i>Correlatum</i>. 2. <i>Contraria</i>. 3. <i>Habitus</i> and <i>Privatio</i>. 4. <i>Affirmatio</i> and <i>Negatio</i>.</p>

Aristotle reckoned &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; a true genus or not, was debated among
 the commentators. The word &#960;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; implies that he did not; and he
treats even the term &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945; as a &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, though it is less
wide in its application than &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, which includes <i>Relata</i> (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">I</span>. p. 1055, a. 17). He even treats &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; as a &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; (p. 1055, a. 34).</p>

are enumerated by Aristotle in various other places:— Topic. ii. p. 109,
 b. 17; p. 113, b. 15; Metaphys. <span class="smcap">I</span>. p. 1055, a. 38. In Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>.
 p. 1018, a. 20, two other varieties are added. Bonitz observes (ad
Metaph. p. 247) that Aristotle seems to treat this quadripartite
distribution of <i>Opposita</i>, “tanquam certum et exploratum, pariter ac causarum numerum,” &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>These four modes of opposition have passed from the Categoriæ of
Aristotle into all or most of the modern treatises on Logic. The three
last of the four are usefully classed together, and illustrated by their
 contrasts with each other. But as to the first of the four, I cannot
think that Aristotle has been happy in the place which he has assigned
to it. To treat <i>Relativa</i> as a variety of <i>Opposita</i>, appears
 to me an inversion of the true order of classification; placing the
more comprehensive term in subordination to the less comprehensive.
Instead of saying that Relatives are a variety of the Opposite, we ought
 rather to say that Opposites are varieties of the Relative. We have
here another proof of what has been remarked a few pages above; the
narrow and inadequate conception which Aristotle formed of his <i>Ad Aliquid</i> or the Relative; restricting it to cases in which the describing phrase is grammatically elliptical.<a name="FnAnchor3_143" href="#Footnote3_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a> The three classes last-mentioned by Aristotle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span> (1. <i>Contraria</i>, 2. <i>Habitus</i> and <i>Privatio</i>, 3. <i>Affirmatio</i> and <i>Negatio</i>) are truly <i>Opposita</i>; in each there is a different mode of opposition, which it is good to distinguish from the others. But the <i>Relatum</i> and its <i>Correlatum</i>, as such, are not necessarily <i>Opposite</i>
 at all; they are compared or conceived in conjunction with each other;
while a name, called relative, which connotes such comparison, &amp;c.,
is bestowed upon each. <i>Opposita</i> fall under this general description, as parts (together with other parts not <i>Opposita</i>) of a larger whole. They ought properly to be called <i>Opposite-Relativa</i>: the phrase <i>Relative-Opposita</i>, as applied to Relatives generally, being discontinued as incorrect.<a name="FnAnchor3_144" href="#Footnote3_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a></p>

Ammonius and Simplikius inform us that there was much debate among the
commentators about these four alleged varieties of &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;; also,
that even Aristotle himself had composed a special treatise (not now
extant), &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7944;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957;, full of perplexing &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;, which the
Stoics afterwards discussed without solving (Schol. p. 83, a. 15-48).
Herminus and others seem to have felt the difficulty of calling all
Relatives &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;; for they admitted that the antithesis between the
 Relative and its Correlate was of gentler character, not conflicting,
but reciprocally sustaining. Alexander ingeniously compared <i>Relatum</i> and its <i>Correlatum</i> to the opposite rafters of a roof, each supporting the other (&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#8033;&#962; <span class="gesp"> &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#949;&#7984; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#963;&#974;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#945;·</span>

&#955;&#945;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8134; &#958;&#973;&#955;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;, &amp;c., Schol. p. 81, b. 32; p. 82,
 a. 15, b. 20). This is an undue enlargement of the meaning of <i>Opposita</i>,
 by taking in the literal material sense as an adjunct to the logical.
On the contrary, the Stoics are alleged to have worked out the views of
Aristotle about &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;, but to have restricted the meaning of <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;'">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> to contradictory opposition, <i>i. e.</i>
 to Affirmative and Negative Propositions with the same subject and
predicate (Schol. p. 83, b. 11; p. 87, a. 29). In Metaphysica, <span class="smcap">A</span>.
 983, a. 31, Aristotle calls the final cause (&#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;)
&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957; to the cause (among his four), &#964;&#8056; <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#8003;&#952;&#949;&#957;'">&#8005;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> &#7969; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. This is a misleading phrase; the two are not opposed, but mutually implicated and correlative.</p></div>

Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his System of Logic, Book I. chap. ii. § 7, p.

<p>
After reading that definition, the inconvenience of ranking Relatives as
 a species or variety of Opposites, will be seen at once.</p></div>
<p>
From <i>Opposita</i> Aristotle passes to <i>Prius</i> and <i>Simul</i>; with the different modes of each.<a name="FnAnchor3_145" href="#Footnote3_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a> <i>Successive</i> and <i>Synchronous</i>,
 are the two most general classes under which facts or events can be
cast. They include between them all that is meant by Order in Time. They
 admit of no definition, and can be explained only by appeal to
immediate consciousness in particular cases. Priority and Simultaneity,
in this direct and primary sense, are among the clearest and most
impressive notions of the human mind. But Aristotle recognizes four
additional meanings of these same words, which he distinguishes from the
 primary, in the same way as he distinguishes (in the ten Categories)
the different meanings of <i>Essentia</i>, in a gradually descending scale of analogy. The secondary <i>Prius</i> is that which does not reciprocate according to the order of existence with its <i>Posterius</i>; where the <i>Posterius</i> presupposes the <i>Prius</i>, while the <i>Prius</i> does not presuppose the <i>Posterius</i>: for example, given two, the existence of one is necessarily implied; but given one, the existence of two is not implied.<a name="FnAnchor3_146" href="#Footnote3_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a> The tertiary <i>Prius</i>
 is that which comes first in the arrangements of science or discourse:
as, in geometry, point and line are prior as compared with the diagrams
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>demonstrations;
 in writing, letters are prior as compared with syllables; in speeches,
the proem is prior as compared with the exposition. A fourth mode of <i>Prius</i> (which is the most remote and far-fetched) is, that the better and more honourable is <i>prius naturâ</i>.
 Still a fifth mode is, when, of two Relatives which reciprocate with
each other as to existence, one is cause and the other effect: in such a
 case, the cause is said to be prior by nature to the effect.<a name="FnAnchor3_147" href="#Footnote3_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a> For example, if it be a fact that Caius exists, the proposition “Caius exists,” is a true proposition; and <i>vice versâ</i>, if the proposition “Caius exists” is a true proposition, it is a fact that Caius exists. But though from either <span class="correction" title="amended from 'if'">of</span>
 these you can infer the other, the truth of the proposition is the
effect, and not the cause, of the reality of the fact. Hence it is
correct to say that the latter is <i>prius naturâ</i>, and the former <i>posterius naturâ</i>.</p>

This is a sort of article in a Philosophical Dictionary, tracing the
various derivative senses of two very usual correlative phrases; and
there is another article in the fourth book of the Metaphysica, where
the derivations of the same terms are again traced out, though by roads
considerably different.<a name="FnAnchor3_148" href="#Footnote3_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a> The two terms are relatives; <i>Prius</i> implies a <i>Posterius</i>, as <i>Simul</i> implies another <i>Simul</i>;
 and it is an useful process to discriminate clearly the various
meanings assigned to each. Aristotle has done this, not indeed clearly
nor consistently with himself, but with an earnest desire to elucidate
what he felt to be confused and perplexing. Yet there are few terms in
his philosophy which are more misleading. Though he sets out, plainly
and repeatedly the primary and literal sense of Priority, (the temporal
or real), as discriminated from the various secondary and metaphorical
senses, nevertheless when he comes to employ the term <i>Prius</i> in
the course of his reasonings, he often does so without specifying in
which sense he intends it to be understood. And as the literal sense
(temporal or real priority) is the most present and familial to every
man’s mind, so the term is often construed in this sense when it
properly bears only the metaphorical sense. The confusion of logical or
emotional priority (priority either in logical order of conception, or
in esteem and respect) with priority in the order of time, involving
separability of existence, is a frequent source of misunderstanding in
the Aristotelian Physics and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>Metaphysics.
 The order of logical antecedence and sequence, or the fact of logical
coexistence, is of great importance to be understood, with a view to the
 proof of truth, to the disproof of error, or to the systematization of
our processes of thought; but we must keep in mind that what is prior in

<a name="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>
<h2>
<span class="smcap">DE INTERPRETATIONE.</span> </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the preceding chapter I enumerated and discussed what Aristotle calls
 the Categories. We shall now proceed to the work which stands second in
 the aggregate called the Organon — the treatise De Interpretatione. </p>
<p>
We have already seen that the Aristotelian Ontology distinguishes one group of varieties of <i>Ens</i> (or different meanings of the term <i>Ens</i>) as corresponding to the diversity of the ten Categories; while recognizing also another variety of <i>Ens</i> as <i>Truth</i>, with its antithesis <i>Non-Ens</i> as <i>Falsehood</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_1" href="#Footnote4_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 The former group was dealt with in the preceding chapter; the latter
will form the subject of the present chapter. In both, indeed, Ontology
is looked at as implicated with Logic; that is, <i>Ens</i> is considered
 as distributed under significant names, fit to be coupled in
propositions. This is the common basis both of the Categoriæ and of the
treatise De Interpretatione. The whole classification of the Categories
rests on the assumption of the proposition with its constituent parts,
and on the different relation borne by each of the nine <i>genera</i> of
 predicates towards their common Subject. But in the Categoriæ no
account was taken of the distinction between truth and falsehood, in the
 application of these predicates to the Subject. If we say of Sokrates,
that he is fair, pug-nosed, brave, wise, &amp;c., we shall predicate
truly; if we say that he is black, high-nosed, cowardly, stupid,
&amp;c., we shall predicate falsely; but in each case our predicates
will belong to the same Category — that of <i>Quale</i>. Whether we
describe him as he now is, standing, talking, in the market-place at
Athens; or whether we describe him as he is not, sitting down, singing,
in Egypt — in both speeches, our predicates rank under the same
Categories, <i>Jacere</i>, <i>Agere</i>, <i>Ubi</i>. No account is taken
 in the Categoriæ of the distinction between true and false application
of predicates; we are only informed under what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>number of general heads all our predicates must be included, whether our propositions be true or false in each particular case. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote4_1" id="Footnote4_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor4_1">1</a></span> See above in the preceding chapter, <a href="#page60">p. 60</a>.</p></div>
<p>
But this distinction between <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>, which
remained unnoticed in the Categoriæ, comes into the foreground in the
treatise De Interpretatione. The Proposition, or enunciative speech,<a name="FnAnchor4_2" href="#Footnote4_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 is distinguished from other varieties of speech (interrogative,
precative, imperative) by its communicating what is true or what is
false. It is defined to be a complex significant speech, composed of two
 terms at least, each in itself significant, yet neither of them,
separately taken, communicating truth or falsehood. The terms
constituting the Proposition are declared to be a Noun in the nominative
 case, as Subject, and a Verb, as Predicate; this latter essentially
connoting time, in order that the synthesis of the two may become the
enunciation of a fact or quasi-fact, susceptible of being believed or
disbelieved. All this mode of analysing a proposition, different from
the analysis thereof given or implied in the Categoriæ, is conducted
with a view to bring out prominently its function of imparting true or
false information. The treatise called the Categoriæ is a theory of
significant names subjicible and predicable, fit to serve as elements of
 propositions, but not yet looked at as put together into actual
propositions; while in the treatise De Interpretatione they are assumed
to be put together, and a theory is given of Propositions thus
completed.</p>

<p>
Words spoken are marks significant of mental impressions associated with
 them both by speaker and hearer; words written are symbols of those
thus uttered. Both speech and writing differ in different nations,
having no natural connection with the things signified. But these last,
the affections or modifications of the mind, and the facts or objects of
 which they are representations or likenesses, are the same to all.
Words are marks primarily and directly of the first, secondarily and
indirectly of the second.<a name="FnAnchor4_3" href="#Footnote4_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
 Aristotle thus recognizes these two aspects — first, the subjective,
next the objective, as belonging, both of them conjointly, to
significant language, yet as logically distinguishable; the former
looking to the proximate <i>correlatum</i>, the latter to the ultimate. </p>

<p>
For this doctrine, that the mental affections of mankind, and the things
 or facts which they represent, are the same everywhere, though the
marks whereby they are signified differ, Aristotle refers us to his
treatise De Animâ, to which he says <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>that it properly belongs.<a name="FnAnchor4_4" href="#Footnote4_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> He thus recognizes the legitimate dependence of Logic on Psychology or Mental Philosophy.</p>

mainly, that Andronikus the Rhodian rested his opinion, that the
treatise De Interpretatione was not the work of Aristotle. Andronikus
contended that there was nothing in the De Animâ to justify the
reference. But Ammonius in his Scholia (p. 97, Brand.) makes a
sufficient reply to the objection of Andronikus. The third book De Animâ
 (pp. 430, 431) lays down the doctrine here alluded to. Compare
Torstrick’s Commentary, p. 210.</p></div>
<p>
That which is signified by words (either single or in combination) is
some variety of these mental affections or of the facts which they
represent. But the signification of a single Term is distinguished, in
an important point, from the signification of that conjunction of terms
which we call a Proposition. A noun, or a verb, belonging to the
aggregate called a language, is associated with one and the same
phantasm<a name="FnAnchor4_5" href="#Footnote4_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 or notion, without any conscious act of conjunction or disjunction, in
the minds of speakers and hearers: when pronounced, it arrests for a
certain time the flow of associated ideas, and determines the mind to
dwell upon that particular group which is called its meaning.<a name="FnAnchor4_6" href="#Footnote4_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 But neither the noun nor the verb, singly taken, does more than this;
neither one of them affirms, or denies, or communicates any information
true or false. For this last purpose, we must conjoin the two together
in a certain way, and make a Proposition. The signification of the
Proposition is thus specifically distinct from that of either of its two
 component elements. It communicates what purports to be matter of fact,
 which may be either true or false; in other words, it implies in the
speaker, and raises in the hearer, the state of belief or disbelief,
which does not attach either to the noun or to the verb separately.
Herein the Proposition is discriminated from other significant
arrangements of words (precative, interrogative, which convey no truth
or falsehood), as well as from its own component parts. Each of these
parts, noun and verb, has a significance of its own; but these are the
ultimate elements of speech, for the parts of the noun or of the verb
have no significance at all. The Verb is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>distinguished from the Noun by connoting time, and also by always serving as predicate to some noun as subject.<a name="FnAnchor4_7" href="#Footnote4_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

Aristotle intimates his opinion, distinctly and even repeatedly, upon
the main question debated by Plato in the Kratylus. He lays it down that
 all significant speech is significant by convention only, and not by
nature or as a natural instrument.<a name="FnAnchor4_8" href="#Footnote4_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
 He tells us also that, in this treatise, he does not mean to treat of
all significant speech, but only of that variety which is known as <i>enunciative</i>.
 This last, as declaring truth or falsehood, is the only part belonging
to Logic as he conceives it; other modes of speech, the precative,
imperative, interrogative, &amp;c., belong more naturally to Rhetoric or
 Poetic.<a name="FnAnchor4_9" href="#Footnote4_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 Enunciative speech may be either simple or complex; it may be one
enunciation, declaring one predicate (either in one word or in several
words) of one subject; or it may comprise several such.<a name="FnAnchor4_10" href="#Footnote4_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 The conjunction of the predicate with the subject constitutes the
variety of proposition called Affirmation; the disjunction of the same
two is Negation or Denial.<a name="FnAnchor4_11" href="#Footnote4_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 But such conjunction or disjunction, operated by the cogitative act,
between two mental states, takes place under the condition that,
wherever conjunction may be enunciated, there also disjunction may be
enunciated, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Whatever may be affirmed, it is possible also to deny; whatever may be denied, it is possible also to affirm.<a name="FnAnchor4_12" href="#Footnote4_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

To every affirmative proposition there is thus opposed a contradictory
negative proposition; to every negative a contradictory affirmative.
This pair of contradictory opposites may be called an <i>Antiphasis</i>;
 always assuming that the predicate and subject of the two shall be
really the same, without equivocation of terms — a proviso necessary to
guard against troublesome puzzles started by Sophists.<a name="FnAnchor4_13" href="#Footnote4_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> And we must also distinguish these propositions opposite as <i>Contradictories</i>, from propositions opposite as <i>Contraries</i>. For this, it has to be observed that there is a distinction among things (&#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;) as universal or singular, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>according as they are, in their nature, predicable of a number or not: <i>homo</i> is an example of the first, and <i>Kallias</i>
 is an example of the second. When, now, we affirm a predicate
universally, we must attach the mark of universality to the subject and
not to the predicate; we must say, Every man is white, No man is white.
We cannot attach the mark of universality to the predicate, and say,
Every man is every animal; this would be untrue.<a name="FnAnchor4_14" href="#Footnote4_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> An affirmation, then, is <i>contradictorily</i>
 opposed to a negation, when one indicates that the subject is
universally taken, and the other, that the subject is taken not
universally, <i>e.g. Omnis homo est albus</i>, <i>Non omnis homo est albus</i>; <i>Nullus homo est albus</i>, <i>Est aliquis homo albus</i>. The opposition is <i>contrary</i>, when the affirmation is universal, and the negation is also universal, <i>i.e.</i>, when the subject is marked as universally taken in each: for example, <i>Omnis homo est albus</i>, <i>Nullus homo est albus</i>.
 Of these contrary opposites, both cannot be true, but both may be
false. Contradictory opposites, on the other hand, while they cannot
both be true, cannot both be false; one must be false and the other
true. This holds also where the subject is a singular term, as Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchor4_15" href="#Footnote4_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> If, however, an universal term appear as subject in the proposition <i>indefinitely</i>, that is, without any mark of universality whatever, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Est albus homo</i>, <i>Non est albus homo</i>,
 then the affirmative and negative are not necessarily either contrary
or contradictory, though they may be so sometimes: there is no
opposition, properly speaking, between them; both may alike be true.
This last observation (says Aristotle) will seem strange, because many
persons suppose that <i>Non est homo albus</i> is equivalent to <i>Nullus homo est albus</i>; but the meaning of the two is not the same, nor does the truth of the latter follow from that of the former,<a name="FnAnchor4_16" href="#Footnote4_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> since <i>homo</i> in the former may be construed as not universally taken. </p>

 Ibid. p. 17, b. 29-37. Mr. John Stuart Mill (System of Logic, Bk. I.
ch. iv. s. 4) cites and approves Dr. Whately’s observation, that the
recognition of a class of Propositions called <i>indefinite</i> “is a solecism, of the same nature as that committed by grammarians when in their list of genders they enumerate the <i>doubtful</i> gender. The speaker <i>must mean</i> to assert the proposition either as an universal or as a particular proposition, though he has failed to declare which.”</p>
<p>
But Aristotle would not have admitted Dr. Whately’s doctrine, declaring what the speaker “<i>must mean</i>.” Aristotle fears that his class, <i>indefinite</i>,
 will appear impertinent, because many speakers are not conscious of any
 distinction or transition between the particular and the general. The
looseness of ordinary speech and thought, which Logic is intended to
bring to view and to guard against, was more present to his mind than to
 that of Dr. Whately: moreover, the forms of Greek speech favoured the
ambiguity. </p>
<p>
Aristotle’s observation illustrates the deficiencies of common speaking,
 as to clearness and limitation of meaning, at the time when he began to
 theorize on propositions. </p>
<p>
I think that Whately’s assumption — “the speaker <i>must mean</i>” — is
analogous to the assumption on which Sir W. Hamilton founds his proposal
 for explicit quantification of the predicate, viz., that the speaker <i>must</i>,
 implicitly or mentally, quantify the predicate; and that his speech
ought to be such as to make such quantification explicit. Mr. Mill has
shewn elsewhere that this assumption of Sir. W. Hamilton’s is incorrect.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>It thus appears that there is always one negation corresponding to one and the same affirmation; making up together the <i>Antiphasis</i>, or pair of contradictory opposites, quite distinct from contrary opposites. By <i>one</i>
 affirmation we mean, that in which there is one predicate only, and one
 subject only, whether taken universally or not universally:— </p>
<center><table width="90%">
 <tbody><tr> <td><i>E.g.</i></td> <td>Omnis homo est albus</td> <td>… …</td> <td>Non omnis homo est albus.</td> </tr>

       <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Est homo albus</td><td> … …</td> <td>Non est homo albus.</td></tr>

       <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nullus homo est albus</td> <td>… …</td> <td>Aliquis homo est albus.</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>
<p>But this will only hold on the assumption that <i>album</i> signifies
 one and the same thing. If there be one name signifying two things not
capable of being generalized into one nature, or not coming under the
same definition, then the affirmation is no longer one.<a name="FnAnchor4_17" href="#Footnote4_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> Thus if any one applies the term <i>himation</i> to signify both horse and man, then the proposition, <i>Est himation album</i>, is not one affirmation, but two; it is either equivalent to <i>Est homo albus</i> and <i>Est equus albus</i>
 — or it means nothing at all; for this or that individual man is not a
horse. Accordingly, in this case also, as well as in that mentioned
above, it is not indispensable that one of the two propositions
constituting the <i>Antiphasis</i> should be true and the other false.<a name="FnAnchor4_18" href="#Footnote4_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>

The example which Aristotle here gives is one of a <i>subject</i> designated by an equivocal name; when he had begun with the <i>predicate</i>. It would have been more pertinent if he had said at first, &#949;&#7984; &#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#7955;&#957; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;.</p></div>
<p>
With these exceptions Aristotle lays it down, that, in every <i>Antiphasis</i>,
 one proposition must be true and the other must be false. But (he goes
on to say) this is only true in regard to matters past or present; it is
 not true in regard to events particular and future. To admit it in
regard to these latter, would be to affirm that the sequences of events
are all necessary, and none of them casual or contingent; whereas we
know, by our own personal experience, that many sequences depend upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>our
 deliberation and volition, and are therefore not necessary. If all
future sequences are necessary, deliberation on our part must be
useless. We must therefore (he continues) recognize one class of
sequences which are not uniform — not predetermined by antecedents;
events which <i>may</i> happen, but which also <i>may not</i> happen, for they will not happen. Thus, my coat <i>may</i> be cut into two halves, but it never <i>will</i> be so cut; it will wear out without any such bisection occurring.<a name="FnAnchor4_19" href="#Footnote4_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

<p>
If you affirm the reality of a fact past or present, your affirmation is
 of necessity determinately true, or it is determinately false, <i>i.e.</i>
 the contradictory negation is determinately true. But if you affirm the
 reality of a fact to come, then your affirmation is not by necessity
determinately true, nor is the contradictory negation determinately
true. Neither the one nor the other separately is true: nothing is true
except the disjunctive antithesis as a whole, including both. If you
say, To-morrow there will either be a sea-fight, or there will not be a
sea-fight, this disjunctive or indeterminate proposition, taken as a
whole, will be true. Yet neither of its constituent parts will be
determinately true; neither the proposition, To-morrow there will be a
sea-fight, nor the proposition, To-morrow there will not be a sea-fight.
 But if you speak with regard to past or present — if you say, Yesterday
 either there was a sea-fight or there was not a sea-fight — then not
only will the disjunctive as a whole be true, but also one or other of
its parts will be determinately true.<a name="FnAnchor4_20" href="#Footnote4_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

 Ibid. p. 18, b. 29. Ammonius (Scholia ad De Interpret. p. 119, bb. 18,
28, seq.) expresses Aristotle’s meaning in terms more distinct than
Aristotle himself: &#956;&#8052; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#7936;&#966;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#957;</span>, &amp;c. (b. 43).</p></div>
<p>
This remarkable logical distinction is founded on Aristotle’s
ontological or physical doctrines respecting the sequence and
conjunction of events. He held (as we shall see more fully in the
Physica and other treatises) that sequences throughout the Kosmos were
to a certain extent regular, to a certain extent irregular. The exterior
 sphere of the Kosmos (the <i>Aplan&#275;s</i>) with the countless number of
fixed stars fastened into it, was a type of regularity and uniformity;
eternal and ever moving in the same circular orbit, by necessity of its
own nature, and without any potentiality of doing otherwise. But the
earth and the elemental bodies, organized and unorganized, below the
lunar sphere and in the interior of the Kosmos, were of inferior
perfection and of very different nature. They were indeed in part
governed and pervaded by the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
 and influence of the celestial substance within which they were
comprehended, and from which they borrowed their Form or constituent
essence; but they held this Form implicated with Matter, <i>i.e.</i> the
 principle of potentiality, change, irregularity, generation, and
destruction, &amp;c. There are thus in these sublunary bodies both
constant tendencies and variable tendencies. The <i>constant</i>
Aristotle calls ‘Nature;’ which always aspires to Good, or to perpetual
renovation of Forms as perfect as may be, though impeded in this work by
 adverse influences, and therefore never producing any thing but
individuals comparatively defective and sure to perish. The <i>variable</i>
 he calls ‘Spontaneity’ and ‘Chance,’ forming an independent agency
inseparably accompanying Nature — always modifying, distorting,
frustrating, the full purposes of Nature. Moreover, the different
natural agencies often interfere with each other, while the irregular
tendency interferes with them all. So far as Nature acts, in each of her
 distinct agencies, the phenomena before us are regular and predictable;
 all that is uniform, and all that (without being quite uniform) recurs
usually or frequently, is her work. But, besides and along with Nature,
there is the agency of Chance and Spontaneity, which is essentially
irregular and unpredictable. Under this agency there are possibilities
both for and against; either of two alternative events may happen.</p>
<p>
It is with a view to this doctrine about the variable kosmical agencies
or potentialities that Aristotle lays down the logical doctrine now
before us, distinguishing propositions affirming particular facts past
or present, from propositions affirming particular facts future. In both
 cases alike, the disjunctive antithesis, as a whole, is necessarily
true. Either there was a sea-fight yesterday, or there was not a
sea-fight yesterday: Either there will be a sea-fight to-morrow, or
there will not be a sea-fight to-morrow — both these disjunctives alike
are necessarily true. There is, however, a difference between the one
disjunctive couple and the other, when we take the affirmation
separately or the negation separately. If we say, There will be a
sea-fight to-morrow, that proposition is not necessarily true nor is it
necessarily false; to say that it is either the one or the other
(Aristotle argues) would imply that every thing in nature happened by
necessary agency — that the casual, the potential, the <i>may be or may not be</i>,
 is stopped out and foreclosed. But this last is really the case, in
regard to a past fact. There was a sea-fight yesterday, is a proposition
 either necessarily true or necessarily false. Here the antecedent
agencies have already <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>spent
 themselves, blended, and become realized in one or other of the two
alternative determinate results. There is no potentiality any longer
open; all the antecedent potentiality has been foreclosed. The
proposition therefore is either necessarily true or necessarily false;
though perhaps we may not know whether it is the one or the other. </p>
<p>
In defending his position regarding this question, Aristotle denies
(what he represents his opponents as maintaining) that all events happen
 by necessity. He points to the notorious fact that we deliberate and
take counsel habitually, and that the event is frequently modified,
according as we adopt one mode of conduct or another; which could not be
 (he contends), if the event could be declared beforehand by a
proposition necessarily or determinately true. What Aristotle means by <i>necessity</i>,
 however, is at bottom nothing else than constant sequence or
conjunction, conceived by him as necessary, because the fixed ends which
 Nature is aiming at can only be attained by certain fixed means. To
this he opposes Spontaneity and Chance, disturbing forces essentially
inconstant and irregular; admitting, indeed, of being recorded when they
 <i>have</i> produced effects in the past, yet defying all power of prediction as to those effects which they <i>will</i>
 produce in the future. Hence arises the radical distinction that he
draws in Logic, between the truth of propositions relating to the past
(or present) and to the future.</p>
<p>
But this logical distinction cannot be sustained, because his
metaphysical doctrine (on which it is founded) respecting the
essentially irregular or casual, is not defensible. His opponents would
refuse to grant that there is any agency essentially or in itself
irregular, casual, and unpredictable.<a name="FnAnchor4_21" href="#Footnote4_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> The aggregate of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>Nature
 consists of a variety of sequences, each of them constant and regular,
though intermixed, co-operating, and conflicting with each other, in
such manner that the resulting effects are difficult to refer to their
respective causes, and are not to be calculated beforehand except by the
 highest scientific efforts; often, not by any scientific efforts. We
must dismiss the hypothesis of Aristotle, assuming agencies essentially
irregular and unpredictable, either as to the past or as to the future.
The past has been brought about by agencies all regular, however
multifarious and conflicting, and the future will be brought about by
the like: there is no such distinction of principle as that which
Aristotle lays down between propositions respecting the past and
propositions respecting the future.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote4_21" id="Footnote4_21"></a><a href="#FnAnchor4_21">21</a></span>
 The Stoics were opposed to Aristotle on this point. They recognized no
logical difference in the character of the Antiphasis, whether applied
to past and present, or to future. Nikostratus defended the thesis of
Aristotle against them. See the Scholia of Simplikius on the Categoriæ,
p. 87, b. 30-p. 88, a. 24. &#945;&#7985; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953;

<p>
The remarks of Hobbes, upon the question here discussed by Aristotle,
well deserve to be transcribed (De Corpore, part II. ch. X. s. 5):— </p>
<p>
“But here, perhaps, some man may ask whether those future things, which are called <i>contingents</i>,
 are necessary. I say, therefore, that generally all contingents have
their necessary causes, but are called contingents in respect of other
events, upon which they do not depend; as the rain, which shall be
to-morrow, shall be necessary, that is, from necessary causes; but we
think and say, it happens by chance, because we do not yet perceive the
causes thereof, though they exist now. For men commonly call that <i>casual</i> or <i>contingent</i>,
 whereof they do not perceive the necessary cause; and in the same
manner they use to speak of things past, when not knowing whether a
thing be done or no, they say, it is possible it never was done.</p>
<p>
“Wherefore, all propositions concerning future things, contingent or not contingent — as this, <i>It will rain to-morrow</i>, or this, <i>To-morrow the sun will rise</i>
 — are either necessarily true, or necessarily false; but we call them
contingent, because we do not yet know whether they be true or false;
whereas their verity depends not upon our knowledge, but upon the
foregoing of their causes. But there are some, who, though they confess
this whole proposition, <i>To-morrow it will either rain or not rain</i>, to be true, yet they will not acknowledge the parts of it, as <i>To-morrow it will rain</i>, or <i>To-morrow it will not rain</i>, to be either of them true by itself; because they say neither this nor that is true <i>determinately</i>. But what is this <i>determinately true</i>, but true <i>upon our knowledge</i>,
 or evidently true? And therefore they say no more, but that it is not
yet known whether it be true or no; but they say it more obscurely, and
darken the evidence of the truth with the same words with which they
endeavour to hide their own ignorance.”</p>
<p>
Compare also the fuller elucidation of the subject given by Mr. John
Stuart Mill, in his System of Logic, Bk. III. ch. xvii. s. 2:— “An event
 occurring by chance may be better described as a coincidence from which
 we have no ground to infer an uniformity; the occurrence of an event in
 certain circumstances, without our having reason on that account to
infer that it will happen again in those circumstances. This, however,
when looked closely into, implies that the enumeration of the
circumstances is not complete. Whatever the fact was, since it has
occurred once, we may be sure that if all the circumstances were
repeated, it would occur again; and not only if all, but there is some
particular portion of those circumstances, on which the phenomenon is
invariably consequent. With most of them, however, it is not connected
in any permanent manner: its conjunction with those is said to be the
effect of chance, to be merely casual. Facts casually conjoined are
separately the effect of causes, and therefore of laws; but of different
 causes, and causes not connected by any law. It is incorrect then to
say that any phenomenon is produced by chance; but we may say that two
or more phenomena are conjoined by chance, that they co-exist or succeed
 one another only by chance.”</p></div>
<p>
There is, indeed, one distinction between inferences as to the past and
inferences as to the future, which may have contributed to suggest,
though it will not justify, the position here laid down by Aristotle. In
 regard to the disjunctive — To-morrow there will be a sea-fight, or
there will not be a sea-fight — nothing more trustworthy than inference
or anticipation is practicable: the anticipation of a sagacious man with
 full knowledge is more likely to prove correct than that of a stupid
man with little knowledge; yet both are alike anticipations,
unverifiable at the present moment. But if we turn to the other
disjunctive — Yesterday there was a sea-fight, or there was not a
sea-fight — we are no longer in the same position. The two disputants, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>supposed
 to declare thus, may have been far off, and may have no other means of
deciding the doubt than inference. But the inference here is not
unverifiable: there exist, or may exist, witnesses or spectators of the
two fleets, who can give direct attestation of the reality, and can
either confirm or refute the inference, negative or affirmative, made by
 an absentee. Thus the proposition, Yesterday there was a sea-fight, or
the other, Yesterday there was not a sea-fight, will be verifiable or
determinably true. There are indeed many inferences as to the past, in
regard to which no direct evidence is attainable. Still this is an
accident; for such direct evidence may always be supposed or imagined as
 capable of being brought into court. But, in respect to the future,
verification is out of the question; we are confined to the region of
inference, well or ill-supported. Here, then, we have a material
distinction between the past and the future. It was probably present to
the mind of Aristotle, though he misconceives its real extent of
operation, and makes it subservient to his still more comprehensive
classification of the different contemporaneous agencies (regular and
irregular) which he supposes to pervade the Kosmos.</p>
<p>
In the treatise before us, he next proceeds to state what collocation of
 the negative particle constitutes the special or legitimate negation to
 any given affirmation, or what are the real forms of proposition,
standing in contradictory opposition to certain other forms, so as to
make up one <i>Antiphasis</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_22" href="#Footnote4_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> The simplest proposition must include a noun and a verb, either definite or indefinite: <i>non homo</i> is a specimen of an indefinite noun — <i>non currit</i>,
 of an indefinite verb. There must be, in any one proposition, one
subject and one predicate; even the indefinite noun or verb signifies,
in a certain sense, one thing. Each affirmation comprises a noun, or an
indefinite noun, with a verb; the special corresponding or contradictory
 negation (making up the <i>Antiphasis</i> along with the former) comprises a noun (or an indefinite noun) with an indefinite verb. The simplest proposition is — </p><blockquote>
<center><table width="90%">
 <tbody><tr><td><i>Affirmative</i>.</td><td> </td><td><i>Contradictory Negative</i>.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Est homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>Non est homo.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Est non homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>   <td>Non est non homo.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Here are only two pairs of antithetic propositions, or one quaternion.
The above is an indefinite proposition (which may be either universal or
 not). When we universalize it, or turn it an universal proposition, we
have — </p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span></p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">
 <tbody><tr><td><i>Affirmative</i>.</td><td> </td><td><i>Contradictory Negative</i>.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Est omnis homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>Non est omnis homo.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Est omnis non homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>   <td>Non est omnis non homo.</td></tr>

<p>
The above are specimens of the smallest proposition; but when we regard larger propositions, such as those (called <i>tertii adjacentis</i>) where there are two terms besides <i>est</i>,
 the collocation of the negative particle becomes more complicated, and
requires fuller illustration. Take, as an example, the affirmative <i>Est justus homo</i>, the true negation of this is, <i>Non est justus homo</i>. In these two propositions, <i>homo</i> is the subject; but we may join the negative with it, and we may consider <i>non homo</i>, not less than <i>homo</i>, as a distinct subject for predication, affirmative or negative. Farther, we may attach <i>est</i> and <i>non est</i> either to <i>justus</i> or to <i>non justus</i> as the predicate of the proposition, with either <i>homo</i>, or <i>non homo</i>,
 as subject. We shall thus obtain a double mode of antithesis, or two
distinct quaternions, each containing two pairs of contradictory
propositions. The second pair of the first quaternion will not be in the
 same relation as the second pair of the second quaternion, to the
proposition just mentioned, viz. — (A) <i>Est justus homo</i>; with its negative, (B) <i>Non est justice homo</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_23" href="#Footnote4_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a></p>

In this
passage the words which I have enclosed between brackets are altered by
Waitz: I shall state presently what I think of his alteration. Following
 upon these words there ought to be, and it seems from Ammonius (Schol.
p. 121, a. 20) that there once was, a scheme or table arranging the four
 propositions in the order and disposition which we read in the
Analytica Priora, I. xlvi. p. 51, b. 37, and which I shall here follow.
But no such table now appears in our text; we have only an enumeration
of the four propositions, in a different order, and then a reference to
the Analytica.</p></div>
<p>
First, let us assume <i>homo</i> as subject. We have then </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">
<tbody><tr><th colspan="3">(QUATERNION I.)</th></tr>

  <tr><td>(A) Est justus homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>(B) Non est justus homo.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>(D) Non est non justus homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>   <td>(C) Est non justus homo.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p>
Examining the relation borne by the last two among these four
propositions (C and D), to the first two (A and B), the simple
affirmative and negative, we see that B is the legitimate negative of A,
 and D that of C. We farther see that B is a consequence of C, and D a
consequence of A, but not <i>vice versâ</i>: that is, if C is true, B
must certainly be true; but we cannot infer, because B is true, that C
must also be true: while, if A is true, D must also be true; but D may
perhaps be true, though A be not true. In other words, the relation of D
 to A and of C to B, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>is the same as it would be if the privative term <i>injustus</i> were substituted in place of <i>non justus</i>; <i>i.e.</i> if the proposition C (<i>Est injustus homo</i>) be true, the other proposition B (<i>Non est justus homo</i>) must certainly be true, but the inference will not hold conversely; while if the proposition A (<i>Est justus homo</i>) be true, it must also be true to say D (<i>Non est injustus homo</i>), but not <i>vice versâ</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_24" href="#Footnote4_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> </p>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote4_24" id="Footnote4_24"></a><a href="#FnAnchor4_24">24</a></span>
  Referring to the words cited in the preceding note, I construe &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050;
&#948;&#973;&#959;, &#959;&#8020; as Boethius does (II. pp. 384-385), and not in agreement with
Ammonius (Schol. p. 122, a. 26, Br.), who, however, is followed both by
Julius Pacius and Waitz (p. 344). I think it impossible that these
words, &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#973;&#959;, &#959;&#8020;, can mean (as Ammonius thinks) the &#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; and
&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; themselves, since the very point which Aristotle is affirming
is the relation of these words, &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;, <i>i.e.</i> to the affirmative and negative started from — </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">
  <tbody><tr><td>(A) Est justus homo</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>(B) Non est justus homo.</td></tr>

<p>
As the words &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#948;&#973;&#959; refer to the second contradictory pair (that is, C and D) in the <i>first</i> Quaternion, so the words &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#973;&#959;, &#959;&#8020; designate the second contradictory pair (G and H) in the <i>second</i>
 Quaternion. Though G and H are included in the second Quaternion, they
are here designated by the negative relation (&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#973;&#959;, &#959;&#8020;) which they
bear to A and B, the first contradictory pair of the <i>first</i>
Quaternion. &#948;&#953;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#7985; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; (line 20) is explained and
illustrated by line 37 — &#945;&#8023;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#973;&#959;
&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> &#8033;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957;. Lastly, Aristotle expressly states that the second Quaternion
 will stand independently and by itself (p. 20, a. 1), having noticed it
 in the beginning only in relation to the first.</p></div>
<p>
Such is the result obtained when we take <i>homo</i> as the subject of
the proposition; we get four propositions, of which the two last (C and
D) stand to the two first (B and A) in the same relation as if they (C
and D) were privative propositions. But if, instead of <i>homo</i>, we take <i>non homo</i> as Subject of the proposition (<i>justus</i> or <i>non justus</i>
 being predicates as before), we shall then obtain two other pairs of
contradictory propositions; and the second pair of this new quaternion
will not stand in that same relation to these same propositions B and A.
 We shall then find that, instead of B and A, we have a different
negative and a different affirmative, as the appropriate correlates to
the third and fourth propositions. The new quaternion of propositions,
with <i>non homo</i> as subject, will stand thus — </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">

  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>Here
we see that propositions G and H do not stand to B and A in the same
relations as C and D stand to B and A; but that they stand in that same
relation to two perfectly different propositions, F and E. That is, if
in place of <i>non <span class="correction" title="amended from 'justis'">justus</span></i>, in propositions G and H, we substitute the privative term <i>injustus</i> (thus turning G into <i>Est injustus non homo</i>, and turning H into <i>Non est injustus non homo</i>),
 the relation of G, when thus altered, to F, and the relation of H, when
 thus altered, to E, will be the same as it was before. Or, in other
words, if G be true, F will certainly be true, but not <i>vice versâ</i>; and if E be true, H will certainly be true, but not <i>vice versâ</i>. </p>

There are few chapters in Aristotle more obscure and puzzling than the
tenth chapter of the De Interpretatione. It was found so by Alexander,
Herminus, Porphyry, Ammonius, and all the Scholiasts. Ammonius (Schol.
pp. 121, 122, Br.) reports these doubts, and complains of it as a riddle
 almost insolvable. The difficulties remain, even after the long note of
 Waitz, and the literal translation of M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire.</p></div>
<p>
The propositions which we have hitherto studied have been indefinite;
that is, they might be universal or not. But if we attach to them the
sign of universality, and construe them as universals, all that we have
said about them would still continue to be true, except that the
propositions which are diametrically (or diagonally) opposed would not
be both true in so many instances. Thus, let us take the first
quaternion of propositions, in which <i>est</i> is attached to <i>homo</i>, and let us construe these propositions as universal. They will stand thus — </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">

  <tbody><tr><td>(A) Omnis est homo justus</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>(B) Non omnis est homo justus.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>(D) Non omnis est homo non justus</td> <td>… … … …</td>   <td>(C) Omnis est homo non justus.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p class="noind">
In these propositions, as in the others before noticed, the same
relation prevails between C and B, and between A and D; if C be true, B
also is true, but not <i>vice versâ</i>; if A be true, D also will be true, but not <i>vice versâ</i>. But the propositions diagonally opposed will not be so often alike true:<a name="FnAnchor4_26" href="#Footnote4_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> thus, if A be true (<i>Omnis est homo justus</i>), C cannot be true (<i>Omnis est homo non justus</i>);
 whereas in the former quaternion of propositions (indefinite, and
therefore capable of being construed as not universal) A and C might

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>It is
 thus that Aristotle explains the distinctions of meaning in
propositions, arising out of the altered collocation of the negative
particle; the distinction between (1) <i>Non est justus</i>, (2) <i>Est non justus</i>, (3) <i>Est injustus</i>. The first of the three is the only true negative, corresponding to the affirmative <i>Est Justus</i>.
 The second is not a negative at all, but an affirmative (&#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;,
 or by transposition, as Theophrastus afterwards called it). The third
is an affirmative, but privative. Both the second and the third stand
related in the same manner to the first; that is, the truth of the first
 is a necessary consequence either of the second or of the third, but
neither of these can be certainly inferred from the first. This is
explained still more clearly in the Prior Analytics; to which Aristotle
here makes express reference.<a name="FnAnchor4_28" href="#Footnote4_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a></p>

Waitz in his note suggests that instead of &#964;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#953; we ought to read
&#964;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#967;&#952;&#969;. But if we suppose that the formal table once existed in the
text, in an order of arrangement agreeing with the Analytica, this
conjectural change would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>
Waitz has made some changes in the text of this chapter, which appear to
 me partly for the better, partly not for the better. Both Bekker and
Bussemaker (Firmin Didot) retain the old text; but this old text was a
puzzle to the ancient commentators, even anterior to Alexander of
Aphrodisias. I will here give first the text of Bekker, next the changes
 made by Waitz: my own opinion does not wholly coincide with either. I
shall cite the text from p. 19, b. 19, leaving out the portion between
lines 30 and 36, which does not bear upon the matter here discussed,
while it obscures the legitimate sequence of Aristotle’s reasoning. </p>

In this text Waitz makes three alterations:— 1. In line 24, instead of &#7970;
 &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179; — he reads, &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;.</p>
<p>
2. In line 30 he makes a similar change; instead of &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179; — he reads, &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183;
 &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;.</p>
<p>
In line 38, instead of &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957;, he reads &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;. </p>
<p>
Of these three alterations the first appears to me good, but
insufficient; the second not good, though the passage as it stands in
Bekker requires amendment; and the third, a change for the worse. </p>
<p>
The purpose of Aristotle is here two-fold. First, to give the reason why, when the propositions were <i>tertii adjacentis</i>, there were two Quaternions or four couples of antithetical propositions; whereas in propositions <i>secundi adjacentis</i>,
 there was only one Quaternion or two couples of antithetical
propositions. Next, to assign the distinction between the first and the
second Quaternion in propositions <i>tertii adjacentis</i>. </p>
<p>
Now the first of these two purposes is marked out in line 25, which I
think we ought to read not by substituting the words of Waitz in place
of the words of Bekker, but by retaining the words of Bekker and
inserting the words of Waitz as an addition to them. The passage after
such addition will stand thus — &#955;&#941;&#947;&#969; &#948;’ &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; <span class="gesp">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179; &#7970; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;, &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;. &#964;&#941;&#964;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;. Here Aristotle declares the <i>reason why</i>
 (&#959;&#8022;&#957;) there come to be four couples of propositions; that reason is,
because &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; and &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; may be joined either with &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; or &#959;&#8016;
&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and either with &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; or with &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;. Both these
alternatives must be specified in order to make out a reason why there
are two Quaternions or four couples of antithetical propositions. But
the passage, as read by Bekker, gives only one of these alternatives,
while the passage, as read by Waitz, gives only the other. Accordingly,
neither of them separately is sufficient; but both of them taken
together furnish the reason required, and thus answer Aristotle’s
purpose. </p>
<p>
Aristotle now proceeds to enunciate the first of the two Quaternions,
and then proceeds to line 30, where the reading of Bekker is irrelevant
and unmeaning; but the amendment of Waitz appears to me still worse,
being positively incorrect in statement of fact. Waitz reads &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; <span class="gesp">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#952;&#945; (in the first Quaternion, which has just been enunciated) &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;</span>.
 These last words are incorrect in fact, for &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; does not
appear in the first Quaternion, but is reserved for the second. While
the reading of Waitz is thus evidently wrong, that of Bekker asserts
nothing to the purpose. It is useless to tell us merely that &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; and
&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; attach both to &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and to &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; in this first
Quaternion (&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#952;&#945;), because that characteristic is equally true of the
 second Quaternion (presently to follow), and therefore constitutes no
distinction between the two. To bring out the meaning intended by
Aristotle I think we ought here also to retain the words of Bekker, and
to add after them some, though not all, of the words of Waitz. The
passage would then stand thus — &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#952;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8183;
&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;, <span class="gesp">&#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#959;&#8016;</span> &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;. Or perhaps <span class="gesp">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;</span>
 &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179; might suffice in the last clause (being a smaller
change), though &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#959;&#8016; seem the proper terms to declare the meaning. In
 the reading which I propose, the sequence intended by Aristotle is
clear and intelligible. Having first told us that &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; and &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;
being joined alternately with &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and with &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and also with
&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; and &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, make up two Quaternions, he proceeds to
enunciate the distinctive character belonging to the first Quaternion of
 the two, viz., that in it &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; and &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; are joined both with
&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;, and also with &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; <i>but not with</i> <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>, This is exactly the truth.</p>
<p>
Aristotle next proceeds to the second Quaternion, where he points out,
as the characteristic distinction, that &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; comes in and
&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; disappears, while &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; and &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; remain included, as in
 the first. This is declared plainly by Aristotle in line 37:— &#945;&#8023;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957;
 &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; (referring to the two pairs of antithetical
propositions in the first Quaternion), <span class="gesp">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>

&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;-&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954;

&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957;, as
applied to the second Quaternion, we see that there must have been some
words preceding which excluded <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>
from the first Quaternion. Waitz contends for the necessity of changing
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957; into &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;. I do not concur with his reasons for the
change; the words that follow, p. 20, line 2, &#8033;&#962; &#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8183; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> &#967;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953; (&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#967;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#7984;), are a reasonable justification of &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957; — <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> &#8033;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953;</span> &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#952;&#941;&#957; being very analogous to &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#962; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;.</p>
<p>
This long note, for the purpose of restoring clearness to an obscure
text, will appear amply justified if the reader will turn to the
perplexities and complaints of the ancient Scholiasts, revealed by
Ammonius and Boethius. Even earlier than the time of Alexander (Schol.
p. 122<span class="correction" title="amended from'.'">,</span> b. 47)
there was divergence in the MSS. of Aristotle; several read &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#8179;
(p. 19, b. 25), several others read &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#8179;. I think that all of them
 were right in what they retained, and wrong by omission only or mainly.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>After this very subtle and obscure distinction between propositions <i>secundi adjacentis</i>, and those <i>tertii adjacentis</i>, in respect to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>the application of the negative, Aristotle touches on the relation of <i>contrariety</i> between propositions. The universal affirmation <i>Omne est animal justum</i> has for its contrary <i>Nullum est animal justum</i>.
 It is plain that both these propositions will never be true at once.
But the negatives or contradictories of both may well be true at once:
thus, <i>Non omne animal est justum</i> (the contradictory of the first) and <i>Est aliquid animal justum</i> (the contradictory of the second) may be and are both alike true. If the affirmative proposition <i>Omnis homo est non justus</i> be true, the negative <i>Nullus est homo justus</i> must also be true; if the affirmative <i>Est aliquis homo justus</i> be true, the negative <i>Non omnis homo est non justus</i>
 must also be true. In singular propositions, wherever the negative or
denial is true, the indefinite affirmative (&#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, in the
language of Theophrastus) corresponding to it will also be true; in
universal propositions, the same will not always hold. Thus, if you ask,
 Is Sokrates wise? and receive for answer No, you are warranted in
affirming, Sokrates is not wise (the indefinite affirmation). But if you
 ask, Are all men wise? and the answer is No, you are not warranted in
affirming, All men are not wise. This last is the contrary of the
proposition, All men are wise; and two contraries may both be false. You
 are warranted in declaring only the contradictory negative, Not all men
 are wise.<a name="FnAnchor4_29" href="#Footnote4_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a></p>

<p>
Neither the indefinite noun (&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;) nor the indefinite verb (&#959;&#8016;
&#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953; — &#959;&#8016; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;) is a real and true negation, though it appears to
be such. For every negation ought to be either true or false; but <i>non homo</i>, if nothing be appended to it, is not more true or false (indeed less so) than <i>homo</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_30" href="#Footnote4_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> </p>

<p>
The transposition of substantive and adjective makes no difference in the meaning of the phrase; <i>Est albus homo</i> is equivalent to <i>Est homo albus</i>.
 If it were not equivalent, there would be two negations corresponding
to the same affirmation; but we have shown that there can be only one
negation corresponding to one affirmation, so as to make up an <i>Antiphasis</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_31" href="#Footnote4_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

mean exactly the same, neither more nor less — we might have supposed
that Aristotle would have asserted without any proof; that he would have
 been content &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (to use the phrase of
Ammonius in a portion of the Scholia, p. 121, a. 27). But he prefers to
deduce it as a corollary from a general doctrine much less evident than
the statement itself; and after all, his deduction is not conclusive, as
 Waitz has already remarked (ad Organ. I. p. 351).</p></div>
<p>
In one and the same proposition, it is indispensable that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>subject
 be one and the predicate one; if not, the proposition will not be one,
but two or more. Both the subject and the predicate indeed may consist
of several words; but in each case the several words must coalesce to
make one total unity; otherwise the proposition will not be one. Thus,
we may predicate of man — <i>animal</i>, <i>bipes</i>, <i>mansuetum</i>; but these three coalesce into one, so that the proposition will be a single one. On the other hand the three terms <i>homo</i>, <i>albus</i>, <i>ambulans</i>,
 do not coalesce into one; and therefore, if we predicate all respecting
 the same subject, or if we affirm the same predicate respecting all
three, expressing them all by one word, the proposition will not be one,
 but several.<a name="FnAnchor4_32" href="#Footnote4_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a></p>

<p>
Aristotle follows this up by a remark interesting to note, because we
see how much his generalities were intended to bear upon the actual
practice of his day, in regard to dialectical disputation. In dialectic
exercise, the respondent undertook to defend a thesis, so as to avoid
inconsistency between one answer and another, against any questions
which might be put by the opponent. Both the form of the questions, and
the form of the answers, were determined beforehand. No question was
admissible which tended to elicit information or a positive declaration
from the respondent. A proposition was tendered to him, and he was
required to announce whether he affirmed or denied it. The question
might be put in either one of two ways: either by the affirmative alone,
 or by putting both the affirmative and the negative; either in the
form, Is Rhetoric estimable? or in the form, Is Rhetoric estimable or
not? To the first form the respondent answered Yes or No: to the second
form, he replied by repeating either the affirmative or the negative, as
 he preferred. But it was not allowable to ask him, <i>What</i> is Rhetoric? so as to put him under the necessity of enunciating an explanation of his own.<a name="FnAnchor4_33" href="#Footnote4_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote4_33" id="Footnote4_33"></a><a href="#FnAnchor4_33">33</a></span> See the Scholia of Ammonius, p. 127, Br.</p></div>
<p>
Under these canons of dialectic debate, each question was required to be
 really and truly one, so as to admit of a definite answer in one word.
The questioner was either unfair or unskilful, if he wrapped up two
questions really distinct in the same word, and thus compelled the
respondent either to admit them both, or to deny them both, at once.
Against this inconvenience Aristotle seeks to guard, by explaining what
are the conditions under which one and the same word does in fact
include more than one question. He had before brought to view the case
of an equivocal term, which involves such duplication: if <i>himation</i> means both horse and man, it will often happen that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>questions respecting <i>himation</i>
 cannot be truly answered either by Yes or No. He now brings to view a
different case in which the like ambiguity is involved. To constitute
one proposition, it is essential both that the subject should be one,
and that the predicate should be one; either of them indeed may be
called by two or three names, but these names must coalesce into one.
Thus, <i>animal</i>, <i>bipes</i>, <i>mansuetum</i>, coalesce into <i>homo</i>, and may be employed either as one subject or as one predicate; but <i>homo</i>, <i>albus</i>, <i>ambulans</i>, do not coalesce into one; so that if we say, <i>Kallias est homo, albus, ambulans</i>, the proposition is not one but three.<a name="FnAnchor4_34" href="#Footnote4_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
 Accordingly, the respondent cannot make one answer to a question thus
complicated. We thus find Aristotle laying down principles — and
probably no one had ever attempted to do so before him — for the correct
 management of that dialectical debate which he analyses so copiously in
 the Topica. </p>

<p>
There are cases (he proceeds to state) in which two predicates may be
truly affirmed, taken separately, respecting a given subject, but in
which they cannot be truly affirmed, taken together.<a name="FnAnchor4_35" href="#Footnote4_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> Kallias is a <i>currier</i>, Kallias is <i>good</i> — both these propositions may be true; yet the proposition, Kallias is a <i>good currier</i>,

 So, too, we may truly say, Homer <i>is a poet</i>; but we cannot truly say, Homer <i>is</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_36" href="#Footnote4_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> We see by this last remark,<a name="FnAnchor4_37" href="#Footnote4_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> how distinctly Aristotle assigned a double meaning to <i>est</i>: first, <i>per se</i>,
 as meaning existence; next, relatively, as performing the function of
copula in predication. He tells us, in reply either to Plato or to some
other contemporaries, that though we may truly say, <i>Non-Ens est opinabile</i>, we cannot truly say <i>Non-Ens est</i>, because the real meaning of the first of these propositions is, <i><span class="correction" title="amended from 'Nons'">Non</span>-Ens est opinabile non esse</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_38" href="#Footnote4_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>

5. The remark of Aristotle seems to bear upon the doctrine laid down by
Plato in the Sophistes, p. 258 — the close of the long discussion which
begins, p. 237, about &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;, as Ammonius tells us in the Scholia, p.
112, b. 5, p. 129, b. 20, Br. Ammonius also alludes to the Republic; as
if Plato had delivered the same doctrine in both; which is not the fact.

Aristotle now discusses the so-called <span class="smcap">MODAL</span> Propositions — the Possible and the Necessary. What is the appropriate form of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span><i>Antiphasis</i> in the case of such propositions, where <i>possible to be</i>, or <i>necessary to be</i>, is joined to the simple <i>is</i>. After a chapter of some length, he declares that the form of <i>Antiphasis</i>
 suitable for the Simple proposition will not suit for a Modal
proposition; and that in the latter the sign of negation must be annexed
 to the modal adjective — <i>possible</i>, <i>not possible</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
 His reasoning here is not merely involved, but substantially incorrect;
 for, in truth, both in one and in the other, the sign of contradictory
negation ought to be annexed to the copula.<a name="FnAnchor4_39" href="#Footnote4_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> From the <i>Antiphasis</i>
 in Modals Aristotle proceeds to legitimate sequences admissible in such
 propositions, how far any one of them can be inferred from any other.<a name="FnAnchor4_40" href="#Footnote4_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> He sets out four tables, each containing four modal determinations interchangeable with each other. </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">
<tbody><tr><th>1.</th> <th>3.</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tc1">1. Possible (physically) to be. </td><td class="tc1">1. Not possible (physically) to be.</td></tr>

<td class="tc1">2. Possible (logically) to be. </td><td class="tc1">2. Not possible (logically) to be.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td class="tc1">4. Not necessary not to be. </td><td class="tc1">4. Necessary to be.</td></tr>
 </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p>
Aristotle canvasses these tables at some length, and amends them partly
by making the fourth case of the second table change place with the
fourth of the first.<a name="FnAnchor4_41" href="#Footnote4_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> He then discusses whether we can correctly say that the <i>necessary to be</i> is also <i>possible to be</i>. If not, then we might say correctly that the <i>necessary to be</i> is <i>not possible to be</i>; for one side or other of a legitimate <i>Antiphasis</i> may always be truly affirmed. Yet this would be absurd: accordingly we must admit that the <i>necessary to be</i> is also <i>possible to be</i>. Here, however, we fall seemingly into a different absurdity; for the <i>possible to be</i> is also <i>possible not to be</i>; and how can we allow that what is <i>necessary to be</i> is at the same time <i>possible not to be</i>? To escape from such absurdities on both sides, we must distinguish two modes of the Possible: one, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>which
 the affirmative and negative are alike possible; the other in which the
 affirmative alone is possible, because it is always and constantly
realized. If a man is actually walking, we know that it is possible for
him to walk; and even when he is not walking, we say the same, because
we believe that he may walk if he chooses. He is not always walking; and
 in his case, as in all other intermittent realities, the affirmative
and the negative are alike possible. But this is not true in the case of
 necessary, constant, and sempiternal realities. With them there is no
alternative possibility, but only the possibility of their doing or
continuing to do. The celestial bodies revolve, sempiternally and
necessarily; it is therefore possible for them to revolve; but there is
no alternative possibility; it is not possible for them not to revolve.
Perpetual reality thus includes the unilateral, but not the bilateral,
possibility.<a name="FnAnchor4_42" href="#Footnote4_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

Aristotle also intimates (p. 23, a. 18) that it would be better to
reverse the order of the propositions in the tables, and to place the
Necessary before the Possible. M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire has inserted
(in the note to his Translation, p. 197) tables with this reversed
order.</p></div>

<p>
Having thus stated that <i>possible to be</i>, in this unilateral and equivocal sense but in no other, is a legitimate consequence of <i>necessary to be</i>,
 Aristotle proceeds to lay down a tripartite distinction which surprises
 us in this place. “It is plain from what has been said that that which
is by Necessity, is in Act or Actuality; so that if things sempiternal
are prior, Actuality is prior to Possibility. Some things, like the
first (or celestial) substances, are Actualities without Possibility;
others (the generated and perishable substances) which are prior in
nature but posterior in generation, are Actualities along with
Possibility; while a third class are Possibilities only, and never come
into Actuality” (such as the largest number, or the least magnitude).<a name="FnAnchor4_43" href="#Footnote4_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a></p>

<p>
Now the sentence just translated (enunciating a doctrine of Aristotle’s
First Philosophy rather than of Logic) appears decidedly to contradict
what he had said three lines before, viz., that in one certain sense,
the <i>necessary to be</i> included and implied the <i>possible to be</i>;
 that is, a possibility or potentiality unilateral only, not bilateral;
for we are here told that the celestial substance is Actuality without
Possibility (or Potentiality), so that the unilateral sense of this last
 term is disallowed. On the other hand, a third sense of the same term
is recognized and distinguished; a sense neither bilateral nor
unilateral, but the negation of both. This third sense is hardly
intelligible, giving as it does an <i>impossible</i> Possible; it seems a self-contradictory description.<a name="FnAnchor4_44" href="#Footnote4_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> At best, it can only be understood as a limit in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>the
 mathematical sense; a terminus towards which potentiality may come
constantly nearer and nearer, but which it can never reach. The first,
or bilateral potentiality, is the only sense at once consistent,
legitimate, and conformable to ordinary speech. Aristotle himself admits
 that the second and third are equivocal meanings,<a name="FnAnchor4_45" href="#Footnote4_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
 departing from the first as the legitimate meaning; but if equivocal
departure to so great an extent were allowed, the term, put to such
multifarious service, becomes unfit for accurate philosophical
reasoning. And we find this illustrated by the contradiction into which
Aristotle himself falls in the course of a few lines. The sentence of
First Philosophy (which I translated in the last page) is a correction
of the logical statement immediately preceding it, in so far as it
suppresses the <i>necessary</i> Possible, or the unilateral
potentiality. But on the other hand the same sentence introduces a new
confusion by its third variety — the <i>impossible</i> Potential, departing from all clear and consistent meaning of potentiality, and coinciding only with the explanation of <i>Non-Ens</i>, as given by Aristotle elsewhere.<a name="FnAnchor4_46" href="#Footnote4_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a></p>

 M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, in the note to his translation (p. 197)

porte en lui une sorte d’impossibilité.” It contradicts both the two

The triple enumeration given by Aristotle (1. Actuality without
Potentiality. 2. Actuality with Potentiality. 3. Potentiality without
Actuality) presents a neat symmetry which stands in the place of
philosophical exactness.</p></div>
<p>
The contrast of Actual and Potential stands so prominently forward in
Aristotle’s First Philosophy, and is, when correctly understood, so
valuable an element in First Philosophy generally, that we cannot be too
 careful against those misapplications of it into which he himself
sometimes falls. The sense of Potentiality, as including the alternative
 of either affirmative or negative — <i>may be or may not be</i> — is quite essential in comprehending the ontological theories of Aristotle; and when he professes to drop the <i>may not be</i> and leave only the <i>may be</i>,
 this is not merely an equivocal sense of the word, but an entire
renunciation of its genuine sense. In common parlance, indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>we speak elliptically, and say, <i>It may be</i>, when we really mean, <i>It may or may not be</i>.
 But the last or negative half, though not expressly announced, is
always included in the thought and belief of the speaker and understood
by the hearer.<a name="FnAnchor4_47" href="#Footnote4_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a></p>

Many logicians, and Sir William Hamilton very emphatically, have
considered the Modality of propositions as improper to be included in
the province of Logic, and have treated the proceeding of Aristotle in
thus including it, as one among several cases in which he had
transcended the legitimate boundaries of the science.<a name="FnAnchor4_48" href="#Footnote4_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
 This criticism, to which I cannot subscribe, is founded upon one
peculiar view of the proper definition and limits of Logic. Sir W.
Hamilton lays down the limitation peremptorily, and he is warranted in
doing this for himself; but it is a question about which there has been
great diversity of view among expositors, and he has no right to blame
others who enlarge it. My purpose in the present volume is to explain
how the subject presented itself to Aristotle. He was the first author
that ever attempted to present Logic in a scientific aspect; and it is
hardly fair to try him by restrictions emanating from critics much
later. Yet, if he is to be tried upon this point, I think the latitude
in which he indulges preferable to the restricted doctrine of Sir W.
Hamilton.</p>

<p>
In the treatise now before us (De Interpretatione) Aristotle announces
his intention to explain the Proposition or Enunciative Speech, the
conjunction of a noun and a verb; as distinguished, first, from its two
constituents (noun and verb) separately taken; next, from other modes of
 speech, also combining the two (precative, interrogative, &amp;c.). All
 speech (he says), the noun or verb separately, as well as the
proposition conjointly, is, in the first instance, a sign of certain
mental states common to the speaker with his hearers; and, in the second
 instance, a sign of certain things or facts, resembling (or correlating
 with) these mental states.<a name="FnAnchor4_49" href="#Footnote4_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 The noun, pronounced separately, and the verb, pronounced separately,
are each signs of a certain thought in the speaker’s mind, without <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>either
 truth or falsehood; the Proposition, or conjunction of the two, goes
farther and declares truth or falsehood. The words pronounced (he says)
follow the thoughts in the mind, expressing an opinion (<i>i.e.</i>
belief or disbelief) entertained in the mind; the verbal affirmation or
negation gives utterance to a mental affirmation or negation — a feeling
 of belief or disbelief — that something <i>is</i>, or that something <i>is not</i>.<a name="FnAnchor4_50" href="#Footnote4_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> Thus, Aristotle intends to give a theory of the Proposition, leaving other modes of speech to Rhetoric or Poetry:<a name="FnAnchor4_51" href="#Footnote4_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> the Proposition he considers under two distinct aspects. In its first or <i>subjective</i> aspect, it declares the state of the speaker’s mind, as to belief or disbelief. In its second or <i>objective</i>
 aspect, it declares a truth or falsehood correlating with such belief
or disbelief, for the information of the hearer. Now the Mode belonging
to a proposition of this sort, in virtue of its <i>form</i>, is to be <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>.
 But there are also other propositions — other varieties of speech
enunciative — which differ from the Simple or Assertory Proposition
having the form <i>is</i> or <i>is not</i>, and which have distinct
modes belonging to them, besides that of being true or false. Thus we
have the Necessary Proposition, declaring that a thing <i>is</i> so <i>by necessity</i>, that it <i>must be</i> so, or <i>cannot but be</i> so; again, the Problematical Proposition, enunciating that a thing <i>may or may not be so</i>. These two modes attach to the <i>form</i> of the proposition, and are quite distinct from those which attach to its <i>matter</i> as simply affirmed or denied; as when, instead of saying, John is sick, we say, John is sick <i>of a fever</i>, John is <i>dangerously</i> sick, with a merely material modification. Such adverbs, modifying the <i>matter</i>
 affirmed or denied, are numerous, and may be diversified almost without
 limit. But they are not to be placed in the same category with the two
just mentioned, which modify the <i>form</i> of the proposition, and
correspond to a state of mind distinct from simple belief or disbelief,
expressed by a simple affirmation or negation.<a name="FnAnchor4_52" href="#Footnote4_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> In the case of each of the two, Aristotle has laid <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>down rules (correct or incorrect) for constructing the legitimate <i>Antiphasis</i>,
 and for determining other propositions equipollent to, or following
upon, the propositions given; rules distinct from those applying to the
simple affirmation. When we say of anything, <i>It may be or may not be</i>,
 we enunciate here only one proposition, not two; we declare a state of
mind which is neither belief nor disbelief, as in the case of the Simple
 Proposition, but something wavering between the two; yet which is
nevertheless frequent, familiar to every one, and useful to be made
known by a special form of proposition adapted to it — the
Problematical. On the other hand, when we say, <i>It is by necessity — must be — cannot but be</i>
 — we declare our belief, and something more besides; we declare that
the supposition of the opposite of what we believe, would involve a
contradiction — I would contradict some definition or axiom to which we
have already sworn adherence. This again is a state of mind known,
distinguishable, and the same in all, subjectively; though as to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>the objective correlate — what constitutes the Necessary, several different opinions have been entertained.</p>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote4_52" id="Footnote4_52"></a><a href="#FnAnchor4_52">52</a></span>
 Ammonius (in the Scholia on De Interpret. p. 130, a. 16, seq., Brand.)
ranks all modal propositions under the same category, and considers the
number of them to be, not indeed infinite, but very great. He gives as
examples: “The moon changes <i>fast</i>; Plato loves Dion <i>vehemently</i>.”
 Sir W. Hamilton adopts the same view as Ammonius: “Modes may be
conceived without end — all must be admitted, if any are; the line of
distinction attempted to be drawn is futile.” (Discussions on Phil. ut
sup. p. 145.) On the other hand, we learn from Ammonius that most of the
 Aristotelian interpreters preceding him reckoned the simple proposition
 &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; as a modal; and Aristotle himself seems so to mention it
(Analytica Priora, I. ii. p. 25, a. 1); besides that he enumerates <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>,
 which undoubtedly attach to &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, as examples of modes (De
Interpet. c. 12, p. 22, a. 13). Ammonius himself protests against this
doctrine of the former interpreters.</p>
<p>
Mr. John Stuart Mill (System of Logic, Bk. I. ch. iv. s. 2) says:— “A
remark of a similar nature may be applied to most of those distinctions
among propositions which are said to have reference to their <i>modality</i>; as difference of tense or time; the sun <i>did</i> rise, <i>is</i> rising, <i>will</i>
 rise.… The circumstance of time is properly considered as attaching to
the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not to the predicate.
If the same cannot be said of such modifications as these, Cæsar is <i>perhaps</i> dead; it is <i>possible</i>
 that Cæsar is dead; it is only because these fall together under
another head; being properly assertions not of anything relating to the
fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in regard to it; namely,
our absence of disbelief of it. Thus, <i>Cæsar may be dead</i>, means, <i>I am not sure that Cæsar is alive</i>.”</p>
<p>
I do not know whether Mr. Mill means that the function of the copula is
different in these problematical propositions, from what it is in the
categorical propositions: I think there is no difference. But his remark
 that the problematical proposition is an assertion of the state of our
minds in regard to the fact, appears to me perfectly just. Only, we
ought to add, that this is equally true about the categorical
proposition. It is equally true about all the three following
propositions:— 1. The three angles of a triangle may or may not be equal
 to two right angles. 2. The three angles of a triangle are equal to two
 right angles. 3. The three angles of a triangle are necessarily equal
to two right angles. In each of these three propositions, an assertion
of the state of our minds is involved, and a different state of mind in
each. This is the subjective aspect of the proposition; it belongs to
the form rather than to the matter, and may be considered as a mode. The
 commentators preceding Ammonius did so consider it, and said that the
categorical proposition had its mode as well as the others. Ammonius
differed from them, treating the categorical as having no mode — as the
standard unit or point of departure.</p>
<p>
The propositions now known as Hypothetical and Disjunctive, which may
also be regarded as in a certain sense Modals, are not expressly
considered by Aristotle. In the Anal. Prior. I. xliv. p. 50 a. 16-38, he
 adverts to hypothetical syllogisms, and intimates his intention of
discussing them more at length: but this intention has not been
executed, in the works that we possess.</p></div>
<p>
In every complete theory of enunciative speech, these modal propositions
 deserve to be separately explained, both in their substantive meaning
and in their relation to other propositions. Their characteristic
property as Modals belongs to <i>form</i> rather than to <i>matter</i>;
and Aristotle ought not to be considered as unphilosophical for
introducing them into the Organon, even if we adopt the restricted view
of Logic taken by Sir W. Hamilton, that it takes no cognizance of the
matter of propositions, but only of their form. But though I dissent
from Hamilton’s criticisms on this point, I do not concur with the
opposing critics who think that Aristotle has handled the Modal
Propositions in a satisfactory manner. On the contrary, I think that the
 equivocal sense which he assigns to the Potential or Possible, and his
inconsistency in sometimes admitting, sometimes denying, a Potential
that is always actual, and a Potential that is never actual — are
serious impediments to any consistent Logic. The Problematical
Proposition does not admit of being cut in half; and if we are to
recognize a <i>necessary</i> Possible, or an <i>impossible</i> Possible, we ought to find different phrases by which to designate them. </p>
<p>
We must observe that the distinction of Problematical and Necessary
Propositions corresponds, in the mind of Aristotle, to that capital and
characteristic doctrine of his Ontology and Physics, already touched on
in this chapter. He thought, as we have seen, that in the vast
circumferential region of the Kosmos, from the outer sidereal sphere
down to the lunar sphere, celestial substance was a necessary existence
and energy, sempiternal and uniform in its rotations and influence; and
that through its beneficent influence, pervading the concavity between
the lunar sphere and the terrestrial centre (which included the four
elements with their compounds) there prevailed a regularizing tendency
called Nature: modified, however, and partly counteracted by independent
 and irregular forces called Spontaneity and Chance, essentially
unknowable and unpredictable. The irregular sequences thus named by
Aristotle were the objective correlate of the Problematical Proposition
in Logic. In these sublunary sequences, as to future time, <i>may or may not</i>
 was all that could be attained, even by the highest knowledge;
certainty, either of affirmation or negation, was out of the question.
On the other hand, the necessary and uniform energies of the celestial
substance, formed the objective correlate of the Necessary Proposition
in Logic; this substance was not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>merely
 an existence, but an existence necessary and unchangeable. I shall say
more on this when I come to treat of Aristotle as a kosmical and
physical philosopher; at present it is enough to remark that he
considers the Problematical Proposition in Logic to be not purely
subjective, as an expression of the speaker’s ignorance, but something
more, namely, to correlate with an objective essentially unknowable to
all. </p>
<p>
The last paragraph of the treatise De Interpretatione discusses the
question of Contraries and Contradictories, and makes out that the
greatest breadth of opposition is that between a proposition and its
contradictory (Kallias is just — Kallias is not just), not that between a
 proposition and what is called its contrary (Kallias is just — Kallias
is unjust); therefore, that according to the definition of contrary, the
 true contrary of a proposition is its contradictory.<a name="FnAnchor4_53" href="#Footnote4_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
 This paragraph is not connected with that which precedes; moreover,
both the reasoning and the conclusion differ from what we read as well
in this treatise as in other portions of Aristotle. Accordingly,
Ammonius in the Scholia, while informing us that Porphyry had declined
to include it in his commentary, intimates also his own belief that it
is not genuine, but the work of another hand. At best (Ammonius thinks),
 if we must consider it as the work of Aristotle, it has been composed
by him only as a dialectical exercise, to debate an unsettled question.<a name="FnAnchor4_54" href="#Footnote4_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
 I think the latter hypothesis not improbable. The paragraph has
certainly reference to discussions which we do not know, and it may have
 been composed when Aristotle had not fully made up his mind on the
distinction between Contrary and Contradictory. Considering the
difficult problems that he undertook to solve, we may be sure that he
must have written down several trains of thought merely preliminary and
tentative. Moreover, we know that he had composed a distinct treatise
‘De Oppositis,’<a name="FnAnchor4_55" href="#Footnote4_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
 which is unfortunately lost, but in which he must have included this
very topic — the distinction between Contrary and Contradictory. </p>

Whatever may have been the real origin and purpose of this last
paragraph, I think it unsuitable as a portion of the treatise De
Interpretatione. It nullifies, or at least overclouds, one of the best
parts of that treatise, the clear determination of <i>Anaphasis</i> and its consequences. </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>If,
now, we compare the theory of the Proposition as given by Aristotle in
this treatise, with that which we read in the Sophistes of Plato, we
shall find Plato already conceiving the proposition as composed
indispensably of noun and verb, and as being either affirmative or
negative, for both of which he indicates the technical terms.<a name="FnAnchor4_56" href="#Footnote4_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> He has no technical term for either subject or predicate; but he conceives the proposition as belonging to its subject:<a name="FnAnchor4_57" href="#Footnote4_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
 we may be mistaken in the predicates, but we are not mistaken in the
subject. Aristotle enlarges and improves upon this theory. He not only
has a technical term for affirmation and negation, and for negative noun
 and verb, but also for subject and predicate; again, for the mode of
signification belonging to noun and verb, each separately, as
distinguished from the mode of signification belonging to them
conjointly, when brought together in a proposition. He follows Plato in
insisting upon the characteristic feature of the proposition — aptitude
for being true or false; but he gives an ampler definition of it, and he
 introduces the novel and important distribution of propositions
according to the quantity of the subject. Until this last distribution
had been made, it was impossible to appreciate the true value and
bearing of each <i>Antiphasis</i> and the correct language for
expressing it, so as to say neither more nor less. We see, by reading
the Sophistes, that Plato did not conceive the <i>Antiphasis</i>
correctly, as distinguished from Contrariety on the one hand, and from
mere Difference on the other. He saw that the negative of any
proposition does not affirm the contrary of its affirmative; but he knew
 no other alternative except to say, that it affirms only something
different from the affirmative. His theory in the Sophistes recognizes
nothing but affirmative propositions, with the predicate of contrariety
on one hand, or of difference on the other;<a name="FnAnchor4_58" href="#Footnote4_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
 he ignores, or jumps over, the intermediate station of propositions
affirming nothing at all, but simply denying a pre-understood
affirmative. There were other contemporaries, Antisthenes among them,
who declared contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span> to be an impossibility;<a name="FnAnchor4_59" href="#Footnote4_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 an opinion coinciding at bottom with what I have just cited from Plato
himself. We see, in the Theætêtus, the Euthydêmus, the Sophistes, and
elsewhere, how great was the difficulty felt by philosophers of that age
 to find a proper <i>locus standi</i> for false propositions, so as to
prove them theoretically possible, to assign a legitimate function for
the negative, and to escape from the interdict of Parmenides, who
eliminated <i>Non-Ens</i> as unmeaning and incogitable. Even after the
death of Aristotle, the acute disputation of Stilpon suggested many
problems, but yielded few solutions; and Menedêmus went so far as to
disallow negative propositions altogether.<a name="FnAnchor4_60" href="#Footnote4_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a></p>

Theætêtus (pp. 187-196), in which Sokrates in vain endeavours to produce
 some theory whereby &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; may be rendered possible. Hobbes, also,
 in his Computation or Logic (De Corp. c. iii. § 6), followed by Destutt
 Tracy, disallows the negative proposition <i>per se</i>, and treats it
as a clumsy disguise of the affirmative &#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, to use the phrase
 of Theophrastus. Mr. John Stuart Mill has justly criticized this part
of Hobbes’s theory (System of Logic, Book I. ch. iv. § 2).</p></div>
<p>
Such being the conditions under which philosophers debated in the age of
 Aristotle, we can appreciate the full value of a positive theory of
propositions such as that which we read in his treatise De
Interpretatione. It is, so far as we know, the first positive theory
thereof that was ever set out; the first attempt to classify
propositions in such a manner that a legitimate <i>Antiphasis</i> could
be assigned to each; the first declaration that to each affirmative
proposition there belonged one appropriate negative, and to each
negative proposition one appropriate counter-affirmative, and one only;
the earliest effort to construct a theory for this purpose, such as to
hold ground against all the puzzling questions of acute disputants.<a name="FnAnchor4_61" href="#Footnote4_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> The clear determination of the <i>Antiphasis</i>
 in each case — the distinction of Contradictory antithesis from
Contrary antithesis between propositions — this was an important logical
 doctrine never advanced before Aristotle; and the importance of it
becomes manifest when we read the arguments of Plato and Antisthenes,
the former overleaping and ignoring the contradictory opposition, the
latter maintaining that it was a process theoretically indefensible. But
 in order that these two modes of antithesis should be clearly
contrasted, each with its proper characteristic, it was requisite that
the distinction of quantity between different propositions should also
be brought to view, and considered in conjunction with the distinction
of quality. Until this was done, the Maxim <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>of Contradiction, denied by some, could not be shown in its true force or with its proper limits. Now, we find it done,<a name="FnAnchor4_62" href="#Footnote4_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>
 for the first time, in the treatise before us. Here the Contradictory
antithesis (opposition both in quantity and quality) in which one
proposition must be true and the other false, is contrasted with the
Contrary (propositions opposite in quality, but both of them universal).
 Aristotle’s terminology is not in all respects fully developed; in
regard, especially, to the quantity of propositions it is less advanced
than in his own later treatises; but from the theory of the De
Interpretatione all the distinctions current among later logicians, take
 their rise. </p>

 We see, from the argument in the Metaphysica of Aristotle, that there
were persons in his day who denied or refused to admit the Maxim of
Contradiction; and who held that contradictory propositions might both
be true or both false (Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> p. 1006, a. 1; p. 1009, a. 24). He employs several pages in confuting them.</p>
<p>
See the Antinomies in the Platonic Parmenides (pp. 154-155), some of
which destroy or set aside the Maxim of Contradiction (‘Plato and the
Other Companions of Sokrates,’ vol. II. ch. xxv. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40437/40437-h/40437-h.htm#FnAnchorv3_27_79">p. 306</a>).</p></div>
<p>
The distinction of Contradictory and Contrary is fundamental in
ratiocinative Logic, and lies at the bottom of the syllogistic theory as
 delivered in the Analytica Priora. The precision with which Aristotle
designates the Universal proposition with its exact contradictory
antithesis, is remarkable in his day. Some, however, of his observations
 respecting the place and functions of the negative particle (&#959;&#8016;), must
be understood with reference to the variable order of words in a Greek
or Latin sentence; for instance, the distinction between <i>Kallias non est justus</i> and <i>Kallias est non justus</i> does not suggest itself to one speaking English or French.<a name="FnAnchor4_63" href="#Footnote4_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> Moreover, the Aristotelian theory of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>Proposition
 is encumbered with various unnecessary subtleties; and the introduction
 of the Modals (though they belong, in my opinion, legitimately to a
complete logical theory) renders the doctrine so intricate and
complicated, that a judicious teacher will prefer, in explaining the
subject, to leave them for second or ulterior study, when the simpler
relations between categorical propositions have been made evident and
familiar. The force of this remark will be felt more when we go through
the Analytica Priora. The two principal relations to be considered in
the theory of Propositions — Opposition and Equipollence — would have
come out far more clearly in the treatise De Interpretatione, if the
discussion of the Modals had been reserved for a separate chapter.</p>

 The diagram or parallelogram of logical antithesis, which is said to
have begun with Apuleius, and to have been transmitted through Boethius
and the Schoolmen to modern times (Ueberweg, System der Logik, sect. 72,
 p. 174) is as follows:— </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">

  <tbody><tr><td>A. Omnis homo est justus.</td> <td>---</td><td>E. Nullus homo est justus.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td>                                       <td>&#10005;  </td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>I. Aliquis homo est justus.</td><td>---</td>   <td>O. Aliquis homo non est justus.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p class="noind">
But the parallelogram set out by Aristotle in the treatise De
Interpretatione, or at least in the Analytica Priora, is different, and
intended for a different purpose. He puts it thus:— </p>
<blockquote><center><table width="90%">

  <tbody><tr><td>1. Omnis homo est justus</td> <td>… … … …</td>       <td>2. Non omnis homo est justus.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>4. Non omnis homo est non justus</td> <td>… … … …</td>   <td>3. Omnis homo est non justus. </td></tr>
  </tbody></table></center></blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Here Proposition (1) is an affirmative, of which (2) is the direct and
appropriate negative: also Proposition (3) is an affirmative (Aristotle
so considers it), of which (4) is the direct and appropriate negative.
The great aim of Aristotle is to mark out clearly what is the
appropriate negative or &#7944;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; to each &#922;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; (&#956;&#943;&#945; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#956;&#953;&#8118;&#962;
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, p. 17, b. 38), making up together the pair which he calls
&#7944;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;, standing in Contradictory Opposition; and to distinguish this
 appropriate negative from another proposition which comprises the
particle of negation, but which is really a new affirmative. </p>
<p>
The true negatives of <i>homo est justus — Omnis homo est justus</i> are, <i>Homo non est justus — Non omnis homo est justus</i>. If you say, <i>Homo est non justus — Omnis homo est non justus</i>, these are not negative propositions, but new affirmatives (&#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; in the language of Theophrastus).</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Reviewing the treatise De Interpretatione, we have followed Aristotle in
 his first attempt to define what a Proposition is, to point out its
constituent elements, and to specify some of its leading varieties. The
characteristic feature of the Proposition he stated to be — That it
declares, in the first instance, the mental state of the speaker as to
belief or disbelief, and, in its ulterior or final bearing, a state of
facts to which such belief or disbelief corresponds. It is thus
significant of truth or falsehood; and this is its logical character
(belonging to Analytic and Dialectic), as distinguished from its
rhetorical character, with other aspects besides. Aristotle farther
indicated the two principal discriminative attributes of propositions as
 logically regarded, passing under the names of quantity and quality. He
 took great pains, in regard to the quality, to explain what was the
special negative proposition in true contradictory antithesis to each
affirmative. He stated and enforced the important separation of
contradictory propositions from contrary; and he even parted off (which
the Greek and Latin languages admit, though the French and English will
hardly do so) the true negative from the indeterminate affirmative. He
touched also upon equipollent propositions, though he did not go far
into them. Thus commenced with Aristotle the systematic study of
propositions, classified according to their meaning and their various
interdependences with each other as to truth and falsehood — their
mutual consistency or incompatibility. Men who had long been talking
good Greek fluently and familiarly, were taught to reflect upon the
conjunctions of words that they habitually employed, and to pay heed to
the conditions of correct speech in reference to its primary purpose of
affirmation and denial, for the interchange of beliefs and disbeliefs,
the communication of truth, and the rectification of falsehood. To many
of Aristotle’s contemporaries this first attempt to theorize upon the
forms of locution familiar to every one would probably appear hardly
less strange than the interrogative <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>dialectic
 of Sokrates, when he declared himself not to know what was meant by
justice, virtue, piety, temperance, government, &amp;c.; when he
astonished his hearers by asking them to rescue him from this state of
ignorance, and to communicate to him some portion of their supposed
plenitude of knowledge.</p>
<p>
Aristotle tells us expressly that the theory of the Syllogism, both
demonstrative and dialectic, on which we are now about to enter, was his
 own work altogether and from the beginning; that no one had ever
attempted it before; that he therefore found no basis to work upon, but
was obliged to elaborate his own theory, from the very rudiments, by
long and laborious application. In this point of view, he contrasts
Logic pointedly with Rhetoric, on which there had been a series of
writers and teachers, each profiting by the labours of his predecessors.<a name="FnAnchor5_1" href="#Footnote5_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 There is no reason to contest the claim to originality here advanced by
 Aristotle. He was the first who endeavoured, by careful study and
multiplied comparison of propositions, to elicit general truths
respecting their ratiocinative interdependence, and to found thereupon
precepts for regulating the conduct of demonstration and dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor5_2" href="#Footnote5_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

 Sir Wm. Hamilton, Lectures on Logic, Lect. v. pp. 87-91, vol. III.:—
“The principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle can both be traced
back to Plato, by whom they were enounced and frequently applied; though
 it was not till long after, that either of them obtained a distinctive
appellation. To take the principle of Contradiction first. This law
Plato frequently employs, but the most remarkable passages are found in
the Phædo (p. 103), in the Sophista (p. 252), and in the Republic (iv.
436, vii. 525). This law was however more distinctively and emphatically
 enounced by Aristotle.… Following Aristotle, the Peripatetics
established this law as the highest principle of knowledge. From the
Greek Aristotelians it obtained the name by which it has subsequently
been denominated, the <i>principle</i>, or <i>law</i>, or <i>axiom</i>, of <i>Contradiction</i>
 (&#7936;&#958;&#943;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;).… The law of Excluded Middle between two
contradictories remounts, as I have said, also to Plato; though the
Second Alcibiades, in which it is most clearly expressed (p. 139; also
Sophista, p. 250), must be admitted to be spurious.… This law, though
universally recognized as a principle in the Greek Peripatetic school,
and in the schools of the middle ages, only received the distinctive
appellation by which it is now known at a comparatively modern date.” </p>
<p>
The passages of Plato, to which Sir W. Hamilton here refers, will not be
 found to bear out his assertion that Plato “enounced and frequently
applied the principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle.” These two
principles are both of them enunciated, denominated, and distinctly
explained by Aristotle, but by no one before him, as far as our
knowledge extends. The conception of the two maxims, in their
generality, depends upon the clear distinction between Contradictory
Opposition and Contrary Opposition; which is fully brought out by
Aristotle, but not adverted to, or at least never broadly and generally
set forth, by Plato. Indeed it is remarkable that the word &#7944;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
the technical term for Contradiction, never occurs in Plato; at least it
 is not recognized in the <i>Lexicon Platonicum</i>. Aristotle puts it
in the foreground of his logical exposition; for, without it, he could
not have explained what he meant by Contradictory Opposition. See
Categoriæ, pp. 13-14, and elsewhere in the treatise De Interpretatione
and in the Metaphysica. Respecting the idea of the Negative as put forth
 by Plato in the Sophistes (not coinciding either with Contradictory
Opposition or with Contrary Opposition), see ‘Plato and the Other
Companions of Sokrates,’ vol. II. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40437/40437-h/40437-h.htm#Sidenotev3_29_34">ch. xxvii. pp. 449-459</a>.
 I have remarked in that chapter, and the reader ought to recollect,
that the philosophical views set out by Plato in the Sophistes differ on
 many points from what we read in other Platonic dialogues.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>He
begins the Analytica Priora by setting forth his general purpose, and
defining his principal terms and phrases. His manner is one of
geometrical plainness and strictness. It may perhaps have been common to
 him with various contemporary geometers, whose works are now lost; but
it presents an entire novelty in Grecian philosophy and literature. It
departed not merely from the manner of the rhetoricians and the physical
 philosophers (as far as we know them, not excluding even Demokritus),
but also from Sokrates and the Sokratic school. For though Sokrates and
Plato were perpetually calling for definitions, and did much to make
others feel the want of such, they neither of them evinced aptitude or
readiness to supply the want. The new manner of Aristotle is adapted to
an undertaking which he himself describes as original, in which he has
no predecessors, and is compelled to dig his own foundations. It is
essentially didactic and expository, and contrasts strikingly with the
mixture of dramatic liveliness and dialectical subtlety which we find in
 Plato.</p>
<p>
The terminology of Aristotle in the Analytica is to a certain extent
different from that in the treatise De Interpretatione. The Enunciation
(&#7944;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#962;) appears under the new name of &#928;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;, <i>Proposition</i> (in the literal sense) or <i>Premiss</i>; while, instead of Noun and Verb, we have the word <i>Term</i> (&#8013;&#961;&#959;&#962;), applied alike both to Subject and to Predicate.<a name="FnAnchor5_3" href="#Footnote5_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> We pass now from the region of <i>declared</i> truth, into that of <i>inferential</i> or <i>reasoned</i>
 truth. We find the proposition looked at, not merely as communicating
truth in itself, but as generating and helping to guarantee certain
ulterior propositions, which communicate something additional or
different. The primary purpose of the Analytica is announced to be, to
treat of Demonstration and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>demonstrative
 Science; but the secondary purpose, running parallel with it and
serving as illustrative counterpart, is, to treat also of Dialectic;
both of them<a name="FnAnchor5_4" href="#Footnote5_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> being applications of the inferential or ratiocinative process, the theory of which Aristotle intends to unfold. </p>

<p>
&#8013;&#961;&#959;&#962; — <i>Terminus</i> — seems to have been a technical word first employed by Aristotle himself to designate subject and predicate as the <i>extremes</i> of a proposition, which latter he conceives as the <i>interval</i> between the <i>termini</i> — <span class="gesp">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>. (Analyt. Prior. I. xv. p. 35, a. 12. &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &amp;c. See Alexander, Schol. pp. 145-146.)</p>
<p>
In the Topica Aristotle employs &#8005;&#961;&#959;&#962; in a very different sense — &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#8001;
 &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957; (Topic. I. v. p. 101, b. 39) — hardly
distinguished from &#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;. The Scholia take little notice of this
remarkable variation of meaning, as between two treatises of the Organon
 so intimately connected (pp. 256-257, Br.).</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_4" id="Footnote5_4"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_4">4</a></span> Analyt. Prior. I. i. p. 24, a. 25.</p></div>
<p>
The three treatises — 1, Analytica Priora, 2, Analytica Posteriora, 3,
Topica with Sophistici Elenchi — thus belong all to one general scheme;
to the theory of the Syllogism, with its distinct applications, first,
to demonstrative or didactic science, and, next, to dialectical debate.
The scheme is plainly announced at the commencement of the Analytica
Priora; which treatise discusses the Syllogism generally, while the
Analytica Posteriora deals with Demonstration, and the Topica with
Dialectic. The first chapter of the Analytica Priora and the last
chapter of the Sophistici Elenchi (closing the Topica), form a preface
and a conclusion to the whole. The exposition of the Syllogism,
Aristotle distinctly announces, precedes that of Demonstration (and for
the same reason also precedes that of Dialectic), because it is more
general: every demonstration is a sort of syllogism, but every syllogism
 is not a demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor5_5" href="#Footnote5_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_5" id="Footnote5_5"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_5">5</a></span> Ibid. I. iv. p. 25, b. 30.</p></div>
<p>
As a foundation for the syllogistic theory, propositions are classified
according to their quantity (more formally than in the treatise De
Interpretatione) into Universal, Particular, and Indefinite or
Indeterminate;<a name="FnAnchor5_6" href="#Footnote5_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 Aristotle does not recognize the Singular Proposition as a distinct
variety. In regard to the Universal Proposition, he introduces a
different phraseology according as it is looked at from the side of the
Subject, or from that of the Predicate. The Subject is, or is not, in
the whole Predicate; the Predicate is affirmed or denied respecting all
or every one of the Subject.<a name="FnAnchor5_7" href="#Footnote5_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 The minor term of the Syllogism (in the first mode of the first figure)
 is declared to be in the whole middle term; the major is declared to
belong to, or to be predicable of, all and every the middle term.
Aristotle says that the two are the same; we ought rather to say that
each is the concomitant and correlate of the other, though his
phraseology is such as to obscure the correlation. </p>

 as Waitz remarks in note. Julius Pacius says:— “Idem re, sed ratione
differunt ut ascensus et descensus; nam subjectum dicitur esse vel non
esse in toto attributo, quia attributum dicitur de omni vel de nullo
subjecto” (p. 128).</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>The
definition given of a Syllogism is very clear and remarkable:— “It is a
speech in which, some positions having been laid down, something
different from these positions follows as a necessary consequence from
their being laid down.” In a <i>perfect</i> Syllogism nothing additional
 is required to make the necessity of the consequence obvious as well as
 complete. But there are also <i>imperfect</i> Syllogisms, in which such
 necessity, though equally complete, is not so obviously conveyed in the
 premisses, but requires some change to be effected in the position of
the terms in order to render it conspicuous.<a name="FnAnchor5_8" href="#Footnote5_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>
The term Syllogism has acquired, through the influence of Aristotle, a
meaning so definite and technical, that we do not easily conceive it in
any other meaning. But in Plato and other contemporaries it bears a much
 wider sense, being equivalent to reasoning generally, to the process of
 comparison, abstraction, generalization.<a name="FnAnchor5_9" href="#Footnote5_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 It was Aristotle who consecrated the word, so as to mean exclusively
the reasoning embodied in propositions of definite form and number.
Having already analysed propositions separately taken, and discriminated
 them into various classes according to their constituent elements, he
now proceeds to consider propositions in combination. Two propositions,
if properly framed, will conduct to a third, different from themselves,
but which will be necessarily true if they are true. Aristotle calls the
 three together a Syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor5_10" href="#Footnote5_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 He undertakes to shew how it must be framed in order that its
conclusion shall be necessarily true, if the premisses are true. He
furnishes schemes whereby the cast and arrangement of premisses, proper
for attaining truth, may be recognized; together with the nature of the
conclusion, warrantable under each arrangement.</p>

 Julius Pacius (ad Analyt. Prior. I. i.) says that it is a mistake on
the part of most logicians to treat the Syllogism as including three
propositions (ut vulgus logicorum putat). He considers the premisses
alone as constituting the Syllogism; the conclusion is not a part
thereof, but something distinct and superadded. It appears to me that
the <i>vulgus logicorum</i> are here in the right.</p></div>
<p>
In the Analytica Priora, we find ourselves involved, from and after the
second chapter, in the distinction of Modal propositions, the necessary
and the possible. The rules respecting the simple Assertory propositions
 are thus, even from the beginning, given in conjunction and contrast
with those respecting the Modals. This is one among many causes of the
difficulty and obscurity with which the treatise is beset. Theophrastus
and Eudemus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>seem also to have followed their master by giving prominence to the Modals:<a name="FnAnchor5_11" href="#Footnote5_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 recent expositors avoid the difficulty, some by omitting them
altogether, others by deferring them until the simple assertory
propositions have been first made clear. I shall follow the example of
these last; but it deserves to be kept in mind, as illustrating
Aristotle’s point of view, that he regards the Modals as principal
varieties of the proposition, co-ordinate in logical position with the
simple assertory. </p>

<p>
Before entering on combinations of propositions, Aristotle begins by
shewing what can be done with single propositions, in view to the
investigation or proving of truth. A single proposition may be <i>converted</i>;
 that is, its subject and predicate may be made to change places. If a
proposition be true, will it be true when thus converted, or (in other
words) will its converse be true? If false, will its converse be false?
If this be not always the case, what are the conditions and limits under
 which (assuming the proposition to be true) the process of conversion
leads to assured truth, in each variety of propositions, affirmative or
negative, universal or particular? As far as we know, Aristotle was the
first person that ever put to himself this question; though the answer
to it is indispensable to any theory of the process of proving or
disproving. He answers it before he enters upon the Syllogism. </p>
<p>
The rules which he lays down on the subject have passed into all logical
 treatises. They are now familiar; and readers are apt to fancy that
there never was any novelty in them — that every one knows them without
being told. Such fancy would be illusory. These rules are very far from
being self-evident, any more than the maxims of Contradiction and of the
 Excluded Middle. Not one of the rules could have been laid down with
its proper limits, until the discrimination of propositions, both as to
quality (affirmative or negative), and as to quantity (universal or
particular), had been put prominently forward and appreciated in all its
 bearings. The rule for trustworthy conversion is different for each
variety of propositions. The Universal Negative may be converted simply;
 that is, the predicate may become subject, and the subject may become
predicate — the proposition being true after conversion, if it was true
before. But the Universal Affirmative cannot be thus converted simply.
It admits of conversion only in the manner called by logicians <i>per accidens</i>: if the predicate change places with the subject, we cannot be sure that the proposition thus changed will be true, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>unless the new subject be lowered in quantity from universal to particular; <i>e.g.</i> the proposition, All men are animals, has for its legitimate converse not, <i>All</i> animals are men, but only, <i>Some</i>
 animals are men. The Particular Affirmative may be converted simply: if
 it be true that Some animals are men, it will also be true that Some
men are animals. But, lastly, if the true proposition to be converted be
 a Particular Negative, it cannot be converted at all, so as to make
sure that the converse will be true also.<a name="FnAnchor5_12" href="#Footnote5_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_12" id="Footnote5_12"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_12">12</a></span> Aristot. Analyt. Prior. I. ii. p. 25, a. 1-26.</p></div>
<p>
Here then are four separate rules laid down, one for each variety of
propositions. The rules for the second and third variety are proved by
the rule for the first (the Universal Negative), which is thus the basis
 of all. But how does Aristotle prove the rule for the Universal
Negative itself? He proceeds as follows: “If A cannot be predicated of
any one among the B’s, neither can B be predicated of any one among the
A’s. For if it could be predicated of any one among them (say C), the
proposition that A cannot be predicated of any B would not be true;
since C is one among the B’s.”<a name="FnAnchor5_13" href="#Footnote5_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
 Here we have a proof given which is no proof at all. If I disbelieved
or doubted the proposition to be proved, I should equally disbelieve or
doubt the proposition given to prove it. The proof only becomes valid,
when you add a farther assumption which Aristotle has not distinctly
enunciated, viz.: That if some A (<i>e.g.</i> C) is B, then some B must
also be A; which would be contrary to the fundamental supposition. But
this farther assumption cannot be granted here, because it would imply
that we already know the rule respecting the convertibility of
Particular Affirmatives, viz., that they admit of being converted
simply. Now the rule about Particular Affirmatives is afterwards itself
proved by help of the preceding demonstration respecting the Universal
Negative. As the proof stands, therefore, Aristotle demonstrates each of
 these by means of the other; which is not admissible.<a name="FnAnchor5_14" href="#Footnote5_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>
Julius Pacius (p. 129) proves the Universal Negative to be convertible <i>simpliciter</i>, by a <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>
 cast into a syllogism in the First figure. But it is surely
unphilosophical to employ the rules of Syllogism as a means of proving
the legitimacy of Conversion, seeing that we are forced to assume
conversion in our process for distinguishing valid from invalid
syllogisms. Moreover the <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> assumes the two
fundamental Maxims of Contradiction and Excluded Middle, though these
are less obvious, and stand more in need of proof than the simple
conversion of the Universal Negative, the point that they are brought to
 establish.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_14" id="Footnote5_14"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_14">14</a></span>
 Waitz, in his note (p. 374), endeavours, but I think without success,
to show that Aristotle’s proof is not open to the criticism here
advanced. He admits that it is obscurely indicated, but the
amplification of it given by himself still remains exposed to the same
objection.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>Even
the friends and companions of Aristotle were not satisfied with his
manner of establishing this fundamental rule as to the conversion of
propositions. Eudêmus is said to have given a different proof; and
Theophrastus assumed as self-evident, without any proof, that the
Universal Negative might always be converted simply.<a name="FnAnchor5_15" href="#Footnote5_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 It appears to me that no other or better evidence of it can be offered,
 than the trial upon particular cases, that is to say, Induction.<a name="FnAnchor5_16" href="#Footnote5_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
 Nothing is gained by dividing (as Aristotle does) the whole A into
parts, one of which is C; nor can I agree with Theophrastus in thinking
that every learner would assent to it at first hearing, especially at a
time when no universal maxims respecting the logical value of
propositions had ever been proclaimed. Still less would a Megaric
dialectician, if he had never heard the maxim before, be satisfied to
stand upon an alleged <i>à priori</i> necessity without asking for
evidence. Now there is no other evidence except by exemplifying the
formula, No A is B, in separate propositions already known to the
learner as true or false, and by challenging him to produce any one
case, in which, when it is true to say No A is B, it is not equally true
 to say, No B is A; the universality of the maxim being liable to be
overthrown by any one contradictory instance.<a name="FnAnchor5_17" href="#Footnote5_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> If this proof does not convince him, no better can be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>produced.
 In a short time, doubtless, he will acquiesce in the general formula at
 first hearing, and he may even come to regard it as self-evident. It
will recall to his memory an aggregate of separate cases each
individually forgotten, summing up their united effect under the same
aspect, and thus impressing upon him the general truth as if it were not
 only authoritative but self-authorized.</p>

 We find Aristotle declaring in Topica, II. viii. p. 113, b. 15, that in
 converting a true Universal Affirmative proposition, the negative of
the Subject of the convertend is always true of the negative of the
Predicate of the convertend; <i>e.g.</i> If every man is an animal,
every thing which is not an animal is not a man. This is to be assumed
(he says) upon the evidence of Induction — uncontradicted iteration of

The rule for the simple conversion of the Universal Negative rests upon the same evidence of Induction, never contradicted.</p></div>

 Dr. Wallis, in one of his acute controversial treatises against Hobbes,
 remarks upon this as the process pursued by Euclid in his
demonstrations:— “You tell us next that an Induction, without
enumeration of all the particulars, is not sufficient to infer a
conclusion. Yes, Sir, if after the enumeration of some particulars,
there comes a general clause, <i>and the like in other cases</i> (as
here it doth), this may pass for a proofe till there be a possibility of
 giving some instance to the contrary, which here you will never be able
 to doe. And if such an Induction may not pass for proofe, there is
never a proposition in Euclid demonstrated. For all along he takes no
other course, or at least grounds his Demonstrations on Propositions no
otherwise demonstrated. As, for instance, he proposeth it in general (i.
 c. 1.) — <i>To make an equilateral triangle on a line given</i>. And then he shows you how to do it upon the line A B, which he there shows you, and leaves you to supply: <i>And the same, by the like means, may be done upon any other strait line</i>;
 and then infers his general conclusion. Yet I have not heard any man
object that the Induction was not sufficient, because he did not
actually performe it in all lines possible.” — (Wallis, Due Correction
to Mr. Hobbes, Oxon. 1656, sect. v. p. 42.) This is induction by <i>parity of reasoning</i>. </p>

Aristotle passes next to Affirmatives, both Universal and Particular.
First, if A can be predicated of all B, then B can be predicated of <i>some</i>
 A; for if B cannot be predicated of any A, then (by the rule for the
Universal Negative) neither can A be predicated of any B. Again, if A
can be predicated of some B, in this case also, and for the same reason,
 B can be predicated of some A.<a name="FnAnchor5_18" href="#Footnote5_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
 Here the rule for the Universal Negative, supposed already established,
 is applied legitimately to prove the rules for Affirmatives. But in the
 first case, that of the Universal, it fails to prove <i>some</i> in the sense of <i>not-all</i> or <i>some-at-most</i>,
 which is required; whereas, the rules for both cases can be proved by
Induction, like the formula about the Universal Negative. When we come
to the Particular Negative, Aristotle lays down the position, that it
does not admit of being necessarily converted in any way. He gives no
proof of this, beyond one single exemplification: If some animal is not a
 man, you are not thereby warranted in asserting the converse, that some
 man is not an animal.<a name="FnAnchor5_19" href="#Footnote5_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 It is plain that such an exemplification is only an appeal to
Induction: you produce one particular example, which is entering on the
track of Induction; and one example alone is sufficient to establish the
 negative of an universal proposition.<a name="FnAnchor5_20" href="#Footnote5_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> The converse of a Particular Negative is not in all cases true, though it may be true in many cases.</p>

 Though some may fancy that the rule for converting the Universal
Negative is intuitively known, yet every one must see that the rule for
converting the Universal Affirmative is not thus self-evident, or
derived from natural intuition. In fact, I believe that every learner at
 first hears it with great surprise. Some are apt to fancy that the
Universal Affirmative (like the Particular Affirmative) may be converted
 <i>simply</i>. Indeed this error is not unfrequently committed in
actual reasoning; all the more easily, because there is a class of cases
 (with subject and predicate co-extensive) where the converse of the
Universal Affirmative <i>is</i> really true. Also, in the case of the
Particular Negative, there are many true propositions in which the
simple converse is true. A novice might incautiously generalize upon
those instances, and conclude that both were convertible simply. Nor
could you convince him of his error except by producing examples in
which, when a true proposition of this kind is converted simply, the
resulting converse is notoriously false. The appeal to various separate
cases is the only basis on which we can rest for testing the correctness
 or incorrectness of all these maxims proclaimed as universal.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>From
one proposition taken singly, no new proposition can be inferred; for
purposes of inference, two propositions at least are required.<a name="FnAnchor5_21" href="#Footnote5_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 This brings us to the rules of the Syllogism, where two propositions as
 premisses conduct us to a third which necessarily follows from them;
and we are introduced to the well-known three Figures with their various
 Modes.<a name="FnAnchor5_22" href="#Footnote5_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
 To form a valid Syllogism, there must be three terms and no more; the
two, which appear as Subject and Predicate of the conclusion, are called
 the <i>minor</i> term (or minor extreme) and the <i>major</i> term (or major extreme) respectively; while the third or <i>middle</i> term must appear in each of the premisses, but not in the conclusion. These terms are called <i>extremes</i> and <i>middle</i>,
 from the position which they occupy in every perfect Syllogism — that
is in what Aristotle ranks as the First among the three figures. In <i>his</i>
 way of enunciating the Syllogism, this middle position formed a
conspicuous feature; whereas the modern arrangement disguises it, though
 the denomination <i>middle</i> term is still retained. Aristotle
usually employs letters of the alphabet, which he was the first to
select as abbreviations for exposition;<a name="FnAnchor5_23" href="#Footnote5_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 and he has two ways (conforming to what he had said in the first
chapter of the present treatise) of enunciating the modes of the First
figure. In one way, he begins with the major extreme (Predicate of the
conclusion): A may be predicated of all B, B may be predicated of all C;
 therefore, A may be predicated of all C (Universal Affirmative). Again,
 A cannot be predicated of any B, B can be predicated of all C;
therefore, A cannot be predicated of any C (Universal Negative). In the
other way, he begins with the minor term (Subject of the conclusion): C
is in the whole B, B is in the whole A; therefore, C is in the whole A
(Universal Affirmative). And, C is in the whole B, B is not in the whole
 A; therefore, C is not in the whole A (Universal Negative). We see thus
 that in Aristotle’s way of enunciating the First figure, the middle <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>term is really placed between the two extremes,<a name="FnAnchor5_24" href="#Footnote5_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 though this is not so in the Second and Third figures. In the modern
way of enunciating these figures, the middle term is never placed
between the two extremes; yet the denomination <i>middle</i> still remains.</p>

 M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire (Logique d’Aristote, vol. ii. p. 7, n.),
referring to the examples of Conversion in chap. ii., observes:— “Voici
le prémier usage des lettres représentant des idées; c’est un procédé
tout à fait algébrique, c’est à dire, de généralisation. Déjà, dans
l’Herméneia, ch. 13, § 1 et suiv., Aristote a fait usage de tableaux
pour représenter sa pensée relativement à la consécution des modales. Il
 parle encore spécialement de figures explicatives, liv. 2. des Derniers
 Analytiques, ch. 17, § 7. Vingt passages de l’Histoire des Animaux
attestent qu’il joignait des dessins à ses observations et à ses
théories zoologiques. Les illustrations pittoresques datent donc de fort
 loin. L’emploi symbolique des lettres a été appliqué aussi par Aristote
 à la Physique. Il l’avait emprunté, sans doute, aux procédés des
mathématiciens.”</p>
<p>
We may remark, however, that when Aristotle proceeds to specify those combinations of propositions which <i>do not</i>
 give a valid conclusion, he is not satisfied with giving letters of the
 alphabet; he superadds special illustrative examples (Analyt. Prior. I.
 v. p. 27, a. 7, 12, 34, 38).</p></div>

<p>
The Modes of each figure are distinguished by the different character
and relation of the two premisses, according as these are either
affirmative or negative, either universal or particular. Accordingly,
there are four possible varieties of each, and sixteen possible modes or
 varieties of combinations between the two. Aristotle goes through most
of the sixteen modes, and shows that in the first Figure there are only
four among them that are legitimate, carrying with them a necessary
conclusion. He shows, farther, that in all the four there are two
conditions observed, and that both these conditions are indispensable in
 the First figure:— (1) The major proposition must be universal, either
affirmative or negative; (2) The minor proposition must be affirmative,
either universal or particular or indefinite. Such must be the character
 of the premisses, in the first Figure, wherever the conclusion is valid
 and necessary; and <i>vice versâ</i>, the conclusion will be valid and necessary, when such is the character of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor5_25" href="#Footnote5_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_25" id="Footnote5_25"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_25">25</a></span> Aristot. Analyt. Prior. I. iv. p. 26, b. 26, et sup.</p></div>
<p>
In regard to the four valid modes (<i>Barbara</i>, <i>Celarent</i>, <i>Darii</i>, <i>Ferio</i>,
 as we read in the scholastic Logic) Aristotle declares at once in
general language that the conclusion follows necessarily; which he
illustrates by setting down in alphabetical letters the skeleton of a
syllogism in <i>Barbara</i>. If A is predicated of all B, and B of all
C, A must necessarily be predicated of all C. But he does not justify it
 by any real example; he produces no special syllogism with real terms,
and with a conclusion known beforehand to be true. He seems to think
that the general doctrine will be accepted as evident without any such
corroboration. He counts upon the learner’s memory and phantasy for
supplying, out of the past discourse of common life, propositions
conforming to the conditions in which the symbolical letters have been
placed, and for not supplying any contradictory examples. This might
suffice for a treatise; but we may reasonably believe that Aristotle,
when teaching in his school, would superadd illustrative examples; for
the doctrine was then novel, and he is not unmindful of the errors into
which learners often fall spontaneously.<a name="FnAnchor5_26" href="#Footnote5_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_26" id="Footnote5_26"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_26">26</a></span> Analyt. Poster. I. xxiv. p. 85, b. 21.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>When
he deals with the remaining or invalid modes of the First figure, his
manner of showing their invalidity is different, and in itself somewhat
curious. “If (he says) the major term is affirmed of all the middle,
while the middle is denied of all the minor, no necessary consequence
follows from such being the fact, nor will there be any syllogism of the
 two extremes; for it is equally possible, either that the major term
may be affirmed of all the minor, or that it may be denied of all the
minor; so that no conclusion, either universal or particular, is
necessary in all cases.”<a name="FnAnchor5_27" href="#Footnote5_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
 Examples of such double possibility are then exhibited: first, of three
 terms arranged in two propositions (A and E), in which, from the terms
specially chosen, the major happens to be truly affirmable of all the
minor; so that the third proposition is an universal Affirmative:— </p>
<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td class="caption" width="20%">Major and <br>

  Middle.  </td><td width="5%">}&nbsp;</td>           <td class="tc1"><font size="4.3em"> Animal is predicable of every Man;</font></td></tr>

  Minor      </td><td>}&nbsp;</td>   <td class="tc1"> <font size="4.3em">Animal is predicable of every Horse.</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>
<p class="noind">
Next, a second example is set out with new terms, in which the major
happens not to be truly predicable of any of the minor; thus exhibiting
as third proposition an universal Negative:— </p>
<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td class="caption" width="20%">Major and <br>

  Middle.  </td><td width="5%">}&nbsp;</td>           <td class="tc1"> <font size="4.3em">Animal is predicable of every Man;</font></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">
Middle and <br>

  Minor </td><td>}&nbsp;</td>          <td class="tc1"> <font size="4.3em">Man is not predicable of any Stone;</font></td></tr>

<tr><td class="caption">Major and <br>

  Minor      </td><td>}&nbsp;</td>   <td class="tc1"> <font size="4.3em">Animal is not predicable of any Stone.</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>
<p class="noind">
Here we see that the full exposition of a syllogism is indicated with
real terms common and familiar to every one; alphabetical symbols would
not have sufficed, for the learner must himself recognize the one
conclusion as true, the other as false. Hence we are taught that, after
two premisses thus conditioned, if we venture to join together the major
 and minor so as to form a pretended conclusion, we may in some cases
obtain a true proposition universally Affirmative, in other cases a true
 proposition universally Negative. Therefore (Aristotle argues) there is
 no one necessary conclusion, the same in all cases, derivable from such
 premisses; in other words, this mode of syllogism is invalid and proves
 nothing. He applies the like reasoning to all the other invalid modes
of the first Figure; setting them aside in the same way, and producing
examples wherein double and opposite conclusions (improperly so called),
 both true, are obtained in different cases from the like arrangement of
 premisses.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_27" id="Footnote5_27"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_27">27</a></span> Analyt. Prior. I. iv. p. 26, a. 2, seq.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>This
mode of reasoning plainly depends upon an appeal to prior experience.
The validity or invalidity of each mode of the First figure is tested by
 applying it to different particular cases, each of which is familiar
and known to the learner <i>aliunde</i>; in one case, the conjunction of
 the major and minor terms in the third proposition makes an universal
Affirmative which he knows to be true; in another case, the like
conjunction makes an universal Negative, which he also knows to be true;
 so that there is no one <i>necessary</i> (<i>i.e.</i> no one uniform and trustworthy) conclusion derivable from such premisses.<a name="FnAnchor5_28" href="#Footnote5_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 In other words, these modes of the First figure are not valid or
available in form; the negation being sufficiently proved by one single
undisputed example. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_28" id="Footnote5_28"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_28">28</a></span>
 Though M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire (note, p. 19) declares Aristotle’s
exposition to be a model of analysis, it appears to me that the grounds
for disallowing this invalid mode of the First figure (A — E — A, or A —
 E — E) are not clearly set forth by Aristotle himself, while they are
rendered still darker by some of his best commentators. Thus Waitz says
(p. 381): “Per exempla allata probat (Aristoteles) quod demonstrare
debebat ex ipsâ ratione quam singuli termini inter se habeant: est enim
proprium artis logicæ, ut terminorum rationem cognoscat, dum res
ignoret. Num de Caio prædicetur animal nescit, scit de Caio prædicari
animal, si animal de homine et homo de Caio prædicetur.”</p>
<p>
This comment of Waitz appears to me founded in error. Aristotle had no
means of shewing the invalidity of the mode A E in the First figure,
except by an appeal to particular examples. The invalidity of the
invalid modes, and the validity of the valid modes, rest alike upon this
 ultimate reference to examples of propositions known to be true or
false, by prior experience of the learner. The valid modes are those
which will stand this trial and verification; the invalid modes are
those which will not stand it. Not till such verification has been made,
 is one warranted in generalizing the result, and enunciating a formula
applicable to unknown particulars (rationem terminorum cognoscere, dum
res ignoret). It was impossible for Aristotle to do what Waitz requires
of him. I take the opposite ground, and regret that he did not set forth
 the fundamental test of appeal to example and experience, in a more
emphatic and unmistakeable manner. </p>
<p>
M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire (in the note to his translation, p. 14) does not lend any additional clearness, when he talks of the “<i>conclusion</i>” from the propositions A and E in the First figure. Julius Pacius says (p. 134): “Si tamen <i>conclusio</i>
 dici debet, quæ non colligitur ex propositionibus,” &amp;c. Moreover,
M. St. Hilaire (p. 19) slurs over the legitimate foundation, the appeal
to experience, much as Aristotle himself does: “Puis prenant des
exemples où la <i>conclusion est de toute évidence</i>, Aristote les applique successivement à chacune de ces combinaisons; celles qui donnent la <i>conclusion fournie d’ailleurs par le bon sens</i>, sont concluantes ou syllogistiques, les autres sont asyllogistiques.”</p></div>
<p>
We are now introduced to the Second figure, in which each of the two premisses has the middle term as Predicate.<a name="FnAnchor5_29" href="#Footnote5_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 To give a legitimate conclusion in this figure, one or other of the
premisses must be negative, and the major premiss must be universal;
moreover no affirmative conclusions can ever be obtained in it — none
but negative conclusions, universal or particular. In this Second figure
 too, Aristotle recognizes four valid modes; setting <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>aside the other possible modes as invalid<a name="FnAnchor5_30" href="#Footnote5_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
 (in the same way as he had done in the First figure), because the third
 proposition or conjunction of the major term with the minor, might in
some cases be a true universal affirmative, in other cases a true
universal negative. As to the third and fourth of the valid modes, he
demonstrates them by assuming the contradictory of the conclusion,
together with the major premiss, and then showing that these two
premisses form a new syllogism, which leads to a conclusion
contradicting the minor premiss. This method, called <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>, is here employed for the first time; and employed without being ushered in or defined, as if it were familiarly known.<a name="FnAnchor5_31" href="#Footnote5_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

Lastly, we have the Third figure, wherein the middle term is the Subject
 in both premisses. Here one at least of the premisses must be
universal, either affirmative or negative. But no universal conclusions
can be obtained in this figure; all the conclusions are particular.
Aristotle recognizes six legitimate modes; in all of which the
conclusions are particular, four of them being affirmative, two
negative. The other possible modes he sets aside as in the two preceding
 figures.<a name="FnAnchor5_32" href="#Footnote5_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a></p>

<p>
But Aristotle assigns to the First figure a marked superiority as
compared with the Second and Third. It is the only one that yields
perfect syllogisms; those furnished by the other two are all imperfect.
The cardinal principle of syllogistic proof, as he conceives it, is —
That whatever can be affirmed or denied of a whole, can be affirmed or
denied of any part thereof.<a name="FnAnchor5_33" href="#Footnote5_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
 The major proposition affirms or denies something universally
respecting a certain whole; the minor proposition declares a certain
part to be included in that whole. To this principle the four modes of
the First figure manifestly and unmistakably conform, without any
transformation of their premisses. But in the other figures such
conformity does not obviously appear, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>must
 be demonstrated by reducing their syllogisms to the First figure;
either ostensively by exposition of a particular case, and conversion of
 the premisses, or by <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>. Aristotle, accordingly, claims authority for the Second and Third figures only so far as they can be reduced to the First.<a name="FnAnchor5_34" href="#Footnote5_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
 We must, however, observe that in this process of reduction no new
evidence is taken in; the matter of evidence remains unchanged, and the
form alone is altered, according to laws of logical conversion which
Aristotle has already laid down and justified. Another ground of the
superiority and perfection which he claims for the First figure, is,
that it is the only one in which every variety of conclusion can be
proved; and especially the only one in which the Universal Affirmative
can be proved — the great aim of scientific research. Whereas, in the
Second figure we can prove only <i>negative</i> conclusions, universal or particular; and in the Third figure only <i>particular</i> conclusions, affirmative or negative.<a name="FnAnchor5_35" href="#Footnote5_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> </p>

Such are the main principles of syllogistic inference and rules for
syllogistic reasoning, as laid down by Aristotle. During the mediæval
period, they were allowed to ramify into endless subtle technicalities,
and to absorb the attention of teachers and studious men, long after the
 time when other useful branches of science and literature were pressing
 for attention. Through such prolonged monopoly — which Aristotle, among
 the most encyclopedical of all writers, never thought of claiming for
them — they have become so discredited, that it is difficult to call
back attention to them as they stood in the Aristotelian age. We have to
 remind the reader, again, that though language was then used with great
 ability for rhetorical and dialectical purposes, there existed as yet
hardly any systematic or scientific study of it in either of these
branches. The scheme and the terminology of any such science were alike
unknown, and Aristotle was obliged to construct it himself from the
foundation. The rhetorical and dialectical teaching as then given (he
tells us) was mere unscientific routine, prescribing specimens of art to
 be committed to memory: respecting syllogism (or the conditions of
legitimate deductive inference) absolutely nothing had been said.<a name="FnAnchor5_36" href="#Footnote5_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Under these circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
 his theory of names, notions, and propositions as employed for purposes
 of exposition and ratiocination, is a remarkable example of original
inventive power. He had to work it out by patient and laborious
research. No way was open to him except the diligent comparison and
analysis of propositions. And though all students have now become
familiar with the various classes of terms and propositions, together
with their principal characteristics and relations, yet to frame and
designate such classes for the first time without any precedent to
follow, to determine for each the rules and conditions of logical
convertibility, to put together the constituents of the Syllogism, with
its graduation of Figures and difference of Modes, and with a selection,
 justified by reasons given, between the valid and the invalid modes —
all this implies a high order of original systematizing genius, and must
 have required the most laborious and multiplied comparisons between
propositions in detail.</p>

<p>
The preceding abridgment of Aristotle’s exposition of the Syllogism
applies only to propositions simply affirmative or simply negative. But
Aristotle himself, as already remarked, complicates the exposition by
putting the Modal propositions (Possible, Necessary) upon the same line
as the above-mentioned Simple propositions. I have noticed, in dealing
with the treatise De Interpretatione, the confusion that has arisen from
 thus elevating the Modals into a line of classification co-ordinate
with propositions simply Assertory. In the Analytica, this confusion is
still more sensibly felt, from the introduction of syllogisms in which
one of the premisses is necessary, while the other is only possible. We
may remark, however, that, in the Analytica, Aristotle is stricter in
defining the Possible than he has been in the De Interpretatione; for he
 now disjoins the Possible altogether from the Necessary, making it
equivalent to the Problematical (not merely <i>may be</i>, but <i>may be or may not be</i>).<a name="FnAnchor5_37" href="#Footnote5_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 In the middle, too, of his diffuse exposition of the Modals, he inserts
 one important remark, respecting universal propositions generally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
 which belongs quite as much to the preceding exposition about
propositions simply assertory. He observes that universal propositions
have nothing to do with time, present, past, or future; but are to be
understood in a sense absolute and unqualified.<a name="FnAnchor5_38" href="#Footnote5_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>

162, b. 23; 166, a. 12, b. 15, Brand.). Respecting the want of clearness

<p>
Having finished with the Modals, Aristotle proceeds to lay it down, that
 all demonstration must fall under one or other of the three figures
just described; and therefore that all may be reduced ultimately to the
two first modes of the First figure. You cannot proceed a step with two
terms only and one proposition only. You must have two propositions
including three terms; the middle term occupying the place assigned to
it in one or other of the three figures.<a name="FnAnchor5_39" href="#Footnote5_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> This is obviously true when you demonstrate by direct or ostensive syllogism; and it is no less true when you proceed by <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>. This last is one mode of syllogizing from an hypothesis or assumption:<a name="FnAnchor5_40" href="#Footnote5_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a>
 your conclusion being disputed, you prove it indirectly, by assuming
its contradictory to be true, and constructing a new syllogism by means
of that contradictory together with a second premiss admitted to be
true; the conclusion of this new syllogism being a proposition obviously
 false or known beforehand to be false. Your demonstration must be
conducted by a regular syllogism, as it is when you proceed directly and
 ostensively. The difference is, that the conclusion which you obtain is
 not that which you wish ultimately to arrive at, but something
notoriously false. But as this false conclusion arises from your
assumption or hypothesis that the contradictory of the conclusion
originally disputed was true, you have indirectly made out your case
that this contradictory must have been false, and therefore that the
conclusion originally disputed was true. All this, however, has been
demonstration by regular syllogism, but starting from an hypothesis
assumed and admitted as one of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor5_41" href="#Footnote5_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a></p>

<p>
It deserves to be remarked that Aristotle uses the phrase &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>, not &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;. This bears upon the question as to his views upon what subsequently received the title of <i>hypothetical syllogisms</i>; a subject to which I shall advert in a future <a href="#Footnote5_88">note</a>.</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle here again enforces what he had before urged — that in every
valid syllogism, one premiss at least must be affirmative, and one
premiss at least must be universal. If the conclusion be universal, both
 premisses must be so likewise; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>if
 it be particular, one of the premisses may not be universal. But
without one universal premiss at least, there can be no syllogistic
proof. If you have a thesis to support, you cannot assume (or ask to be
conceded to you) that very thesis, without committing <i>petitio principii,</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>quæsiti</i> or <i>probandi</i>);
 you must assume (or ask to have conceded to you) some universal
proposition containing it and more besides; under which universal you
may bring the subject of your thesis as a minor, and thus the premisses
necessary for supporting it will be completed. Aristotle illustrates
this by giving a demonstration that the angles at the base of an
isosceles triangle are equal; justifying every step in the reasoning by
an appeal to some universal proposition.<a name="FnAnchor5_42" href="#Footnote5_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

13-22) is different from that which we read in Euclid, and is not easy
to follow. It is more clearly explained by Waitz (p. 434) than either by
 Julius Pacius or by M. Barth. St. Hilaire (p. 108).</p></div>

Again, every demonstration is effected by two propositions (an <i>even</i> number) and by three terms (an <i>odd</i>
 number); though the same proposition may perhaps be demonstrable by
more than one pair of premisses, or through more than one middle term;<a name="FnAnchor5_43" href="#Footnote5_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
 that is, by two or more distinct syllogisms. If there be more than
three terms and two propositions, either the syllogism will no longer be
 one but several; or there must be particulars introduced for the
purpose of obtaining an universal by induction; or something will be
included, superfluous and not essential to the demonstration, perhaps
for the purpose of concealing from the respondent the real inference
meant.<a name="FnAnchor5_44" href="#Footnote5_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> In the case (afterwards called <i>Sorites</i>)
 where the ultimate conclusion is obtained through several mean terms in
 continuous series, the number of terms will always exceed by one the
number of propositions; but the numbers may be odd or even, according to
 circumstances. As terms are added, the total of intermediate
conclusions, if drawn out in form, will come to be far greater than that
 of the terms or propositions, multiplying as it will do in an
increasing ratio to them.<a name="FnAnchor5_45" href="#Footnote5_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a></p>

<p>
It will be seen clearly from the foregoing remarks that there is a great
 difference between one thesis and another as to facility of attack or
defence in Dialectic. If the thesis be an Universal Affirmative
proposition, it can be demonstrated only in the First figure, and only
by one combination of premisses; while, on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>other
 hand, it can be impugned either by an universal negative, which can be
demonstrated both in the First and Second figures, or by a particular
negative, which can be demonstrated in all the three figures. Hence an
Universal Affirmative thesis is at once the hardest to defend and the
easiest to oppugn: more so than either a Particular Affirmative, which
can be proved both in the First and Third figures; or a Universal
Negative, which can be proved either in First or Second.<a name="FnAnchor5_46" href="#Footnote5_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 To the opponent, an universal thesis affords an easier victory than a
particular thesis; in fact, speaking generally, his task is easier than
that of the defendant.</p>

In the Analytica Priora, Aristotle proceeds to tell us that he
contemplates not only theory, but also practice and art. The reader must
 be taught, not merely to understand the principles of Syllogism, but
likewise where he can find the matter for constructing syllogisms
readily, and how he can obtain the principles of demonstration pertinent

A thesis being propounded in appropriate terms, with subject and
predicate, how are you the propounder to seek out arguments for its
defence? In the first place, Aristotle reverts to the distinction
already laid down at the beginning of the Categoriæ.<a name="FnAnchor5_48" href="#Footnote5_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
 Individual things or persons are subjects only, never appearing as
predicates — this is the lowest extremity of the logical scale: at the
opposite extremity of the scale, there are the highest generalities,
predicates only, and not subjects of any predication, though sometimes
supposed to be such, as matters of dialectic discussion.<a name="FnAnchor5_49" href="#Footnote5_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 Between the lowest and highest we have intermediate or graduate
generalities, appearing sometimes as subjects, sometimes as predicates;
and it is among these that the materials both of problems for debate,
and of premisses for proof, are usually found.<a name="FnAnchor5_50" href="#Footnote5_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a></p>

that even the <i>principia</i> of science may be debated; for example, in book <span class="smcap">B</span>. of the Metaphysica. Aristotle does not recognize either &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957; or &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957; as true genera, but only as predicates.</p></div>

<p>
You must begin by putting down, along with the matter in hand itself, its definition and its <i>propria</i>; after that, its other predicates; next, those predicates which <i>cannot</i> belong to it; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>lastly,
 those other subjects, of which it may itself be predicated. You must
classify its various predicates distinguishing the essential, the <i>propria</i>, and the accidental; also distinguishing the true and unquestionable, from the problematical and hypothetical.<a name="FnAnchor5_51" href="#Footnote5_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
 You must look out for those predicates which belong to it as subject
universally, and not to certain portions of it only; since universal
propositions are indispensable in syllogistic proof, and indefinite
propositions can only be reckoned as particular. When a subject is
included in some larger genus — as, for example, man in animal — you
must not look for the affirmative or negative predicates which belong to
 animal universally (since all these will of course belong to man also)
but for those which distinguish man from other animals; nor must you, in
 searching for those lower subjects of which man is the predicate, fix
your attention on the higher genus animal; for animal will of course be
predicable of all those of which man is predicable. You must collect
what pertains to man specially, either as predicate or subject; nor
merely that which pertains to him necessarily and universally, but also
usually and in the majority of cases; for most of the problems debated
belong to this latter class, and the worth of the conclusion will be
co-ordinate with that of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor5_52" href="#Footnote5_52"><span class="sp"><span class="correction" title="no footnote number in text of 2nd ed.">52</span></span></a> Do not select predicates that are predicable<a name="FnAnchor5_53" href="#Footnote5_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> both of the predicate and subject; for no valid affirmative conclusion can be obtained from them.</p>

predicates applicable both to the predicate and to the subject, is
curious. We should hardly understand it, if it were not explained a
little further on, p. 44, b. 21. Both the Scholiast and the modern
commentators understand &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7953;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; in this sense; and I do not
venture to depart from them. At the same time, when I read six lines
afterwards (p. 44, b. 26) the words &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7984; &#964;&#8048; &#7953;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#7953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#8179; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940;
&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; — in which the same meaning as that which the commentators ascribe
 to &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7953;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; is given in its own special and appropriate terms,
and thus the same supposition unnecessarily repeated — I cannot help
suspecting that Aristotle intends &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7953;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; to mean something
different; to mean such wide and universal predicates as &#964;&#8056; &#7955;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;
 which soar above the Categories and apply to every thing, but denote no
 real <i>genera</i>.</p></div>
<p>
Thus, when the thesis to be maintained is an universal affirmative (<i>e.g.</i>
 A is predicable of all E), you will survey all the subjects to which A
will apply as predicate, and all the predicates applying to E as
subject. If these two lists coincide in any point, a middle term will be
 found for the construction of a good syllogism in the First figure. Let
 B represent the list of predicates belonging universally to A; D, the
list of predicates which cannot belong to it; C, the list of subjects to
 which A pertains universally as predicate. Likewise, let F represent
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>list
 of predicates belonging universally to E; H, the list of predicates
that cannot belong to E; G, the list of subjects to which E is
applicable as predicate. If, under these suppositions, there is any
coincidence between the list C and the list F, you can construct a
syllogism (in <i>Barbara</i>, Fig. 1), demonstrating that A belongs to <i>all</i>
 E; since the predicate in F belongs to all E, and A universally to the
subject in C. If the list C coincides in any point with the list G, you
can prove that A belongs to <i>some</i> E, by a syllogism (in <i>Darapti</i>,
 Fig. 3). If, on the other hand, the list F coincides in any point with
the list D, you can prove that A cannot belong to any E: for the
predicate in D cannot belong to any A, and therefore (by converting
simply the universal negative) A cannot belong as predicate to any D;
but D coincides with F, and F belongs to all E; accordingly, a syllogism
 (in <i>Celarent</i>, Fig. 1) may be constructed, shewing that A cannot
belong to any E. So also, if B coincides in any point with H, the same
conclusion can be proved; for the predicate in B belongs to all A, but B
 coincides with H, which belongs to no E; whence you obtain a syllogism
(in <i>Camestres</i>, Fig. 2), shewing that no A belongs to E.<a name="FnAnchor5_54" href="#Footnote5_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
 In collecting the predicates and subjects both of A and of E, the
highest and most universal expression of them is to be preferred, as
affording the largest grasp for the purpose of obtaining a suitable
middle term.<a name="FnAnchor5_55" href="#Footnote5_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
 It will be seen (as has been declared already) that every syllogism
obtained will have three terms and two propositions; and that it will be
 in one or other of the three figures above described.<a name="FnAnchor5_56" href="#Footnote5_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a></p>

 Ibid. p. 44, a. 39. Alexander and Philoponus (Scholia, p. 177, a. 19,
39, Brandis) point out an inconsistency between what Aristotle says here
 and what he had said in one of the preceding paragraphs, dissuading the
 inquirer from attending to the highest generalities, and recommending
him to look only at both subject and predicate in their special place on
 the logical scale. Alexander’s way of removing the inconsistency is not
 successful: I doubt if there be an inconsistency. I understand
Aristotle <i>here</i> to mean only that the universal expression KZ (&#964;&#8056;
&#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#918;) is to be preferred to the indefinite or indeterminate (simply
 Z, &#7936;&#948;&#953;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;), also K&#915; (&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#915;) to simple &#915; (&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;). This
appears to me not inconsistent with the recommendation which Aristotle
had given before.</p></div>

<p>
The way just pointed out is the only way towards obtaining a suitable
middle term. If, for example, you find some predicate applicable both to
 A and E, this will not conduct you to a valid syllogism; you will only
obtain a syllogism in the Second figure with two affirmative premisses,
which will not warrant any conclusion. Or if you find some predicate
which cannot belong either to A or to E, this again will only give you a
 syllogism in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>the
 Second figure with two negative premisses, which leads to nothing. So
also, if you have a term of which A can be predicated, but which cannot
be predicated of E, you derive from it only a syllogism in the First
figure, with its minor negative; and this, too, is invalid. Lastly, if
you have a subject, of which neither A nor E can be predicated, your
syllogism constructed from these conditions will have both its premisses
 negative, and will therefore be worthless.<a name="FnAnchor5_57" href="#Footnote5_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a></p>

<p>
In the survey prescribed, nothing is gained by looking out for
predicates (of A and E) which are different or opposite: we must collect
 such as are identical, since our purpose is to obtain from them a
suitable middle term, which must be the same in both premisses. It is
true that if the list B (containing the predicates universally belonging
 to A) and the list F (containing the predicates universally belonging
to E) are incompatible or contrary to each other, you will arrive at a
syllogism proving that no A can belong to E. But this syllogism will
proceed, not so much from the fact that B and F are incompatible, as
from the other fact, distinct though correlative, that B will to a
certain extent coincide with H (the list of predicates which cannot
belong to E). The middle term and the syllogism constituted thereby, is
derived from the coincidence between B and H, not from the opposition
between B and F. Those who derive it from the latter, overlook or
disregard the real source, and adopt a point of view merely incidental
and irrelevant.<a name="FnAnchor5_58" href="#Footnote5_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a></p>

The precept here delivered — That in order to obtain middle terms and
good syllogisms, you must study and collect both the predicates and the
subjects of the two terms of your thesis — Aristotle declares to be
equally applicable to all demonstration, whether direct or by way of <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>.
 In both the process of demonstration is the same — involving two
premisses, three terms, and one of the three a suitable middle term. The
 only difference is, that in the direct demonstration, both premisses
are propounded as true, while in the <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>, one of the premisses is assumed as true though known to be false, and the conclusion also.<a name="FnAnchor5_59" href="#Footnote5_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> In the other cases of hypothetical syllogism your attention must be directed, not to the original <i>quæsitum</i>,
 but to the condition annexed thereto; yet the search for predicates,
subjects, and a middle term, must be conducted in the same manner.<a name="FnAnchor5_60" href="#Footnote5_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> Sometimes, by the help <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>of a condition extraneous to the premisses, you may demonstrate an universal from a particular: <i>e.g.</i>,
 Suppose C (the list of subjects to which A belongs as predicate) and G
(the list of subjects to which E belongs as predicate) to be identical;
and suppose farther that the subjects in G are the <i>only</i> ones to which E belongs as predicate (this seems to be the <i>extraneous</i> or <i>extra-syllogistic</i>
 condition assumed, on which Aristotle’s argument turns); then, A will
be applicable to all E. Or if D (the list of predicates which cannot
belong to A) and G (the list of subjects to which E belongs as
predicate) are identical; then, assuming the like extraneous condition, A
 will not be applicable to any E.<a name="FnAnchor5_61" href="#Footnote5_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
 In both these cases, the conclusion is more universal than the
premisses; but it is because we take in an hypothetical assumption, in
addition to the premisses. </p>

Aristotle concludes by saying that syllogisms from an hypothesis ought
to be reviewed and classified into varieties — &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#941;&#968;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#954;&#945;&#8054;

himself ever executed this classification. It was done in the Analytica
of his successor Theophrastus (Schol. p. 179, a. 6, 24). Compare the
note of M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, p. 140.</p></div>

<p>
Aristotle has now shown a method of procedure common to all
investigations and proper for the solution of all problems, wherever
soluble. He has shown, first, all the conditions and varieties of
probative Syllogism, two premisses and three terms, with the place
required for the middle term in each of the three figures; next, the
quarter in which we are to look for all the materials necessary or
suitable for constructing valid syllogisms. Having the two terms of the
thesis given, we must study the predicates and subjects belonging to
both, and must provide a large list of them; out of which list we must
make selection according to the purpose of the moment. Our selection
will be different, according as we wish to prove or to refute, and
according as the conclusion that we wish to prove is an universal or a
particular. The lesson here given will be most useful in teaching the
reasoner to confine his attention to the sort of materials really
promising, so that he may avoid wasting his time upon such as are
irrelevant.<a name="FnAnchor5_62" href="#Footnote5_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote5_62" id="Footnote5_62"></a><a href="#FnAnchor5_62">62</a></span> Ibid. b. 36-xxx. p. 46, a. 10.</p></div>
<p>
This method of procedure is alike applicable to demonstration in Philosophy or in any of the special sciences,<a name="FnAnchor5_63" href="#Footnote5_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> and to debate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>in Dialectic. In both, the premisses or <i>principia</i>
 of syllogisms must be put together in the same manner, in order to make
 the syllogism valid. In both, too, the range of topics falling under
examination is large and varied; each topic will have its own separate
premisses or <i>principia</i>, which must be searched out and selected in the way above described. Experience alone can furnish these <i>principia</i>,
 in each separate branch or department. Astronomical experience — the
observed facts and phenomena of astronomy — have furnished the data for
the scientific and demonstrative treatment of astronomy. The like with
every other branch of science or art.<a name="FnAnchor5_64" href="#Footnote5_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
 When the facts in each branch are brought together, it will be the
province of the logician or analytical philosopher to set out the
demonstrations in a manner clear and fit for use. For if nothing in the
way of true matter of fact has been omitted from our observation, we
shall be able to discover and unfold the demonstration, on every point
where demonstration is possible; and, wherever it is not possible, to
make the impossibility manifest.<a name="FnAnchor5_65" href="#Footnote5_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a></p>

distinguishable from philosophy on one side, and from dialectic on the
other, had in view geometrical demonstrations.</p></div>

What Aristotle says here — of astronomical observation and experience as
 furnishing the basis for astronomical science — stands in marked
contrast with Plato, who rejects this basis, and puts aside, with a sort
 of contempt, astronomical observation (Republic, vii. pp. 530-531);
treating acoustics also in a similar way. Compare Aristot. Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#923;</span>. p. 1073, a. 6, seq., with the commentary of Bonitz, p. 506.</p></div>

<p>
For the fuller development of these important principles, the reader is
referred to the treatise on Dialectic, entitled Topica, which we shall
come to in a future <a href="#ch9">chapter</a>. There is nothing in all
Aristotle’s writings more remarkable than the testimony here afforded,
how completely he considered all the generalities of demonstrative
science and deductive reasoning to rest altogether on experience and
inductive observation. </p>
<p>
We are next introduced to a comparison between the syllogistic method,
as above described and systematized, and the process called logical
Division into <i>genera</i> and <i>species</i>; a process much relied
upon by other philosophers, and especially by Plato. This logical
Division, according to Aristotle, is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>mere fragment of the syllogistic procedure; nothing better than a feeble syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor5_66" href="#Footnote5_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
 Those who employed it were ignorant both of Syllogism and of its
conditions. They tried to demonstrate — what never can be demonstrated —
 the essential constitution of the subject.<a name="FnAnchor5_67" href="#Footnote5_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a>
 Instead of selecting a middle term, as the Syllogism requires, more
universal than the subject but less universal (or not more so) than the
predicate, they inverted the proper order, and took for their middle
term the highest universal. What really requires to be demonstrated,
they never demonstrated but assume.<a name="FnAnchor5_68" href="#Footnote5_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a></p>

Thus, they take the subject man, and propose to prove that man is
mortal. They begin by laying down that man is an animal, and that every
animal is either mortal or immortal. Here, the most universal term,
animal, is selected as middle or as medium of proof; while after all,
the conclusion demonstrated is, not that man is mortal, but that man is
either mortal or immortal. The position that man is mortal, is assumed
but not proved.<a name="FnAnchor5_69" href="#Footnote5_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
 Moreover, by this method of logical division, all the steps are
affirmative and none negative; there cannot be any refutation of error.
Nor can any proof be given thus respecting <i>genus</i>, or <i>proprium</i>, or <i>accidens</i>; the <i>genus</i> is assumed, and the method proceeds from thence to <i>species</i> and <i>differentia</i>.
 No doubtful matter can be settled, and no unknown point elucidated by
this method; nothing can be done except to arrange in a certain order
what is already ascertained and unquestionable. To many investigations,
accordingly, the method is altogether inapplicable; while even where it
is applicable, it leads to no useful conclusion.<a name="FnAnchor5_70" href="#Footnote5_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a></p>

We now come to that which Aristotle indicates as the third section of
this First Book of the Analytica Priora. In the first section he
explained the construction and constituents of Syllogism, the varieties
of figure and mode, and the conditions indispensable to a valid
conclusion. In the second section he tells us where we are to look for
the premisses of syllogisms, and how we may obtain a stock of materials,

argumentation as it actually occurs (often invalid, and even when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>valid,

<p>
When a piece of reasoning is before us, we must first try to disengage
the two syllogistic premisses (which are more easily disengaged than the
 three terms), and note which of them is universal or particular. The
reasoner, however, may not have set out both of them clearly: sometimes
he will leave out the major, sometimes the minor, and sometimes, even
when enunciating both of them, he will join with them irrelevant matter.
 In either of these cases we must ourselves supply what is wanting and
strike out the irrelevant. Without this aid, reduction to regular
syllogism is impracticable; but it is not always easy to see what the
exact deficiency is. Sometimes indeed the conclusion may follow
necessarily from what is implied in the premisses, while yet the
premisses themselves do not form a correct syllogism; for though every
such syllogism carries with it necessity, there may be necessity without
 a syllogism. In the process of reduction, we must first disengage and
set down the two premisses, then the three terms; out of which three,
that one which appears twice will be the middle term. If we do not find
one term twice repeated, we have got no middle and no real syllogism.
Whether the syllogism when obtained will be in the first, second, or
third figure, will depend upon the place of the middle term in the two
premisses. We know by the nature of the conclusion which of the three
figures to look for, since we have already seen what conclusions can be
demonstrated in each.<a name="FnAnchor5_73" href="#Footnote5_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a></p>

<p>
Sometimes we may get premisses which look like those of a true
syllogism, but are not so in reality; the major proposition ought to be
an universal, but it may happen to be only indefinite, and the syllogism
 will not in all cases be valid; yet the distinction between the two
often passes unnoticed.<a name="FnAnchor5_74" href="#Footnote5_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> Another source <span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>of
 fallacy is, that we may set out the terms incorrectly; by putting (in
modern phrase) the abstract instead of the concrete, or abstract in one
premiss and concrete in the other.<a name="FnAnchor5_75" href="#Footnote5_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a>
 To guard against this, we ought to use the concrete term in preference
to the abstract. For example, let the major proposition be, Health
cannot belong to any disease; and the minor. Disease can belong to any
man; <i>Ergo</i>, Health cannot belong to any man. This conclusion seems
 valid, but is not really so. We ought to substitute concrete terms to
this effect:— It is impossible that the sick can be well; Any man may be
 sick; <i>Ergo</i>, It is impossible that any man can be well. To the
syllogism, now, as stated in these concrete terms, we may object, that
the major is not true. A person who is at the present moment sick may at
 a future time become well. There is therefore no valid syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor5_76" href="#Footnote5_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> When we take the concrete man, we may say with truth that the two contraries, health-sickness, knowledge-ignorance, <i>may</i> both alike belong to him; though not to the same individual at the same time. </p>

M. B. St. Hilaire observes in his note (p. 155): “L’erreur vient
uniquement de ce qu’on confond l’universel et l’indeterminé séparés par
une nuance très faible d’expression, qu’on ne doit pas cependant
negliger.” Julius Pacius (p. 264) gives the same explanation at greater
length; but the example chosen by Aristotle (&#8001; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;

Again, we must not suppose that we can always find one distinct and
separate name belonging to each term. Sometimes one or all of the three
terms can only be expressed by an entire phrase or proposition. In such
cases it is very difficult to reduce the reasoning into regular
syllogism. We may even be deceived into fancying that there are
syllogisms without any middle term at all, because there is no single
word to express it. For example, let A represent equal to two right
angles; B, triangle; C, isosceles. Then we have a regular syllogism,
with an explicit and single-worded middle term; A belongs first to B,
and then to C through B as middle term (triangle). But how do we know
that A belongs to B? We know it by demonstration; for it is a
demonstrable truth that every triangle has its three angles equal to two
 right angles. Yet there is no other more general truth about triangles
from which it is a deduction; it belongs to the triangle <i>per se</i>, and follows from the fundamental properties of the figure.<a name="FnAnchor5_77" href="#Footnote5_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a>
 There is, however, a middle term in the demonstration, though it is not
 single-worded and explicit; it is a declaratory proposition or a fact.
We must not suppose that there can be any demonstration without a middle
 term, either single-worded or many-worded. </p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>When
we are reducing any reasoning to a syllogistic form, and tracing out the
 three terms of which it is composed, we must expose or set out these
terms in the nominative case; but when we actually construct the
syllogism or put the terms into propositions, we shall find that one or
other of the oblique cases, genitive, dative, &amp;c., is required.<a name="FnAnchor5_78" href="#Footnote5_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a>
 Moreover, when we say, ‘this belongs to that,’ or ‘this may be truly
predicated of that,’ we must recollect that there are many distinct
varieties in the relation of predicate to subject. Each of the
Categories has its own distinct relation to the subject; predication <i>secundum quid</i> is distinguished from predication <i>simpliciter</i>, simple from combined or compound, &amp;c. This applies to negatives as well as affirmatives.<a name="FnAnchor5_79" href="#Footnote5_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> There will be a material difference in setting out the terms of the syllogism, according as the predication is qualified (<i>secundum quid</i>) or absolute (<i>simpliciter</i>).
 If it be qualified, the qualification attaches to the predicate, not to
 the subject: when the major proposition is a qualified predication, we
must consider the qualification as belonging, not to the middle term,
but to the major term, and as destined to re-appear in the conclusion.
If the qualification be attached to the middle term, it cannot appear in
 the conclusion, and any conclusion that embraces it will not be proved.
 Suppose the conclusion to be proved is. The wholesome is knowledge <i>quatenus bonum</i> or <i>quod bonum est</i>; the three terms of the syllogism must stand thus:— </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
 <p> <i>Major</i> — <i>Bonum</i> is knowable, <i>quatenus bonum</i> or <i>quod bonum est</i>.</p>
  <p><i>Minor</i> — The wholesome is <i>bonum</i>.</p>
 <p> <i>Ergo</i> — The wholesome is knowable, <i>quatenus bonum</i>, &amp;c. </p></blockquote>
<p class="noind">
For every syllogism in which the conclusion is qualified, the terms must be set out accordingly.<a name="FnAnchor5_80" href="#Footnote5_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> </p>

We are permitted, and it is often convenient, to exchange one phrase or
term for another of equivalent signification, and also one word against
any equivalent phrase. By doing this, we often <span class="correction" title="amended from 'faciliate'">facilitate</span> the setting out of the terms. We must carefully <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>note
 the different meanings of the same substantive noun, according as the
definite article is or is not prefixed. We must not reckon it the same
term, if it appears in one premiss with the definite article, and in the
 other without the definite article.<a name="FnAnchor5_81" href="#Footnote5_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a> Nor is it the same proposition to say B is predicable of C (indefinite), and B is predicable of <i>all</i>
 C (universal). In setting out the syllogism, it is not sufficient that
the major premiss should be indefinite; the major premiss must be
universal; and the minor premiss also, if the conclusion is to be
universal. If the major premiss be universal, while the minor premiss is
 only affirmative indefinite, the conclusion cannot be universal, but
will be no more than indefinite, that is, counting as particular.<a name="FnAnchor5_82" href="#Footnote5_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a></p>

 &#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#957;, of stating the premisses of the syllogism: two terms only,
the major and the middle, being enunciated, while the third or minor was
 included potentially, but not enunciated. Theophrastus, however, did
not recognize the distinction of meaning to which Aristotle alludes in
this chapter. He construed as an universal minor, what Aristotle treats
as only an indefinite minor. The liability to mistake the Indefinite for
 an Universal is here again adverted to.</p></div>

There is no fear of our being misled by setting out a particular case
for the purpose of the general demonstration; for we never make
reference to the specialties of the particular case, but deal with it as
 the geometer deals with the diagram that he draws. He calls the line A
B, straight, a foot long, and without breadth, but he does not draw any
conclusion from these assumptions. All that syllogistic demonstration
either requires or employs, is, terms that are related to each other
either as whole to part or as part to whole. Without this, no
demonstration can be made: the exposition of the particular case is
intended as an appeal to the senses, for facilitating the march of the
student, but is not essential to demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor5_83" href="#Footnote5_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a></p>

 himself by visible particular diagrams or illustrations. (Plato, Repub.

Aristotle reminds us once more of what he had before said, that in the
Second and Third figures, not all varieties of conclusion are possible,
but only some varieties; accordingly, when we are reducing a piece of
reasoning to the syllogistic form, the nature of the conclusion will
inform us which of the three <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>figures
 we must look for. In the case where the question debated relates to a
definition, and the reasoning which we are trying to reduce turns upon
one part only of that definition, we must take care to look for our
three terms only in regard to that particular part, and not in regard to
 the whole definition.<a name="FnAnchor5_84" href="#Footnote5_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>
 All the modes of the Second and Third figures can be reduced to the
First, by conversion of one or other of the premisses; except the fourth
 mode (<i>Baroco</i>) of the Second, and the fifth mode (<i>Bocardo</i>) of the Third, which can be proved only by <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor5_85" href="#Footnote5_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a></p>

<p>
No syllogisms from an Hypothesis, however, are reducible to any of the
three figures; for they are not proved by syllogism alone: they require
besides an extra-syllogistic assumption granted or understood between
speaker and hearer. Suppose an hypothetical proposition given, with
antecedent and consequent: you may perhaps prove or refute by syllogism
either the antecedent separately, or the consequent separately, or both
of them separately; but you cannot directly either prove or refute by
syllogism the conjunction of the two asserted in the hypothetical. The
speaker must ascertain beforehand that this will be granted to him;
otherwise he cannot proceed.<a name="FnAnchor5_86" href="#Footnote5_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> The same is true about the procedure by <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>, which involves an hypothesis over and above the syllogism. In employing such <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>,
 you prove syllogistically a certain conclusion from certain premisses;
but the conclusion is manifestly false; therefore, one at least of the
premisses from which it follows must be false also. But if this
reasoning is to have force, the hearer must know <i>aliunde</i> that the
 conclusion is false; your syllogism has not shown it to be false, but
has shown it to be hypothetically true; and unless the hearer is
prepared to grant the conclusion to be false, your purpose is not
attained. Sometimes he will grant it without being expressly asked, when
 the falsity is glaring: <i>e.g.</i> you prove that the diagonal of a
square is incommensurable with the side, because if it were taken as
commensurable, an odd number might be shown to be equal to an even
number. Few disputants will hesitate to grant that this conclusion is
false, and therefore that its contradictory is true; yet this last (viz.
 that the contradictory is true) has not been proved syllogistically;
you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>must assume it by hypothesis, or depend upon the hearer to grant it.<a name="FnAnchor5_87" href="#Footnote5_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a></p>

M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire remarks in the note to his translation of the
Analytica Priora (p. 178): “Ce chapitre suffit à prouver qu’Aristote a
distingué très-nettement les syllogismes par l’absurde, des syllogismes
hypothétiques. Cette dernière dénomination est tout à fait pour lui ce
qu’elle est pour nous.” Of these two statements, I think the <i>latter</i>
 is more than we can venture to affirm, considering that the general
survey of hypothetical syllogisms, which Aristotle intended to draw up,
either never was really completed, or at least has perished: the <i>former</i> appears to me incorrect. Aristotle decidedly reckons the <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i> among hypothetical proofs. But he understands by <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>
 something rather wider than what the moderns understand by it. It now
means only, that you take the contradictory of the conclusion together
with one of the premisses, and by means of these two demonstrate a
conclusion contradictory or contrary to the other premiss. But Aristotle
 understood by it this, and something more besides, namely, whenever, by
 taking the contradictory of the conclusion, together with some other
incontestable premiss, you demonstrate, by means of the two, some new
conclusion notoriously false. What I here say, is illustrated by the
very example which he gives in this chapter. The incommensurability of
the diagonal (with the side of the square) is demonstrated by <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>;
 because if it be supposed commensurable, you may demonstrate that an
odd number is equal to an even number; a conclusion which every one will
 declare to be inadmissible, but which is not the contradictory of
either of the premisses whereby the true proposition was demonstrated.</p></div>

<p>
Syllogisms from Hypothesis were many and various, and Aristotle intended
 to treat them in a future treatise; but all that concerns the present
treatise, in his opinion, is, to show that none of them can be reduced
to the three Figures. Among the Syllogisms from Hypothesis, two
varieties recognized by Aristotle (besides &#959;&#7984; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;) were &#959;&#7985;
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#957; and &#959;&#7985; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945;. The same proposition which
Aristotle entitles &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#957;, was afterwards designated by the
Stoics &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#957; (Alexander ap. Schol. p. 178, b. 6-24). </p>
<p>
It seems that Aristotle never realized this intended future treatise on
Hypothetical Syllogisms; at least Alexander did not know it. The subject
 was handled more at large by Theophrastus and Eudêmus after Aristotle
(Schol. p. 184, b. 45. Br.; Boethius, De Syllog. Hypothetico, pp.
606-607); and was still farther expanded by Chrysippus and the Stoics. </p>
<p>
Compare Prantl, Geschichte der Logik, I. pp. 295, 377, seq. He treats
the Hypothetical Syllogism as having no logical value, and commends
Aristotle for declining to develop or formulate it; while Ritter (Gesch.
 Phil. iii. p. 93), and, to a certain extent, Ueberweg (System der
Logik, sect. 121, p. 326), consider this to be a defect in Aristotle.</p></div>
<p>
In the last chapter of the first book of the Analytica Priora, Aristotle
 returns to the point which we have already considered in the treatise
De Interpretatione, viz. what is really a <i>negative</i> proposition;
and how the adverb of negation must be placed in order to constitute
one. We must place this adverb immediately before the copula and in
conjunction with the copula: we must not place it after the copula and
in conjunction with the predicate; for, if we do so, the proposition
resulting will not be negative but affirmative (&#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, by
transposition, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span> to the technical term introduced afterwards by Theophrastus). Thus of the four propositions: </p>
<center><table width="50%">
 <tbody><tr><td> 1. Est bonum. </td>        <td>  2. Non est bonum.</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td> 4. Non est non bonum. </td> <td>3. Est non bonum.</td> </tr></tbody></table></center>
<p class="noind">
No. 1 is affirmative; No. 3 is affirmative (&#7952;&#954; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;); Nos. 2 and 4
 are negative. Wherever No. 1 is predicable, No. 4 will be predicable
also; wherever No. 3 is predicable, No. 2 will be predicable also — but
in neither case <i>vice versâ</i>.<a name="FnAnchor5_89" href="#Footnote5_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> Mistakes often flow from incorrectly setting out the two contradictories.</p>

ANALYTICA PRIORA II.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Second Book of the Analytica Priora seems conceived with a view
mainly to Dialectic and Sophistic, as the First Book bore more upon
Demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor6_1" href="#Footnote6_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 Aristotle begins the Second Book by shortly recapitulating what he had
stated in the First; and then proceeds to touch upon some other
properties of the Syllogism. Universal syllogisms (those in which the
conclusion is universal) he says, have always more conclusions than one;
 particular syllogisms sometimes, but not always, have more conclusions
than one. If the conclusion be universal, it may always be converted — <i>simply</i>, when it is negative, or <i>per accidens</i>,
 when it is affirmative; and its converse thus obtained will be proved
by the same premisses. If the conclusion be particular, it will be
convertible simply when affirmative, and its converse thus obtained will
 be proved by the same premisses; but it will not be convertible at all
when negative, so that the conclusion proved will be only itself singly.<a name="FnAnchor6_2" href="#Footnote6_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Moreover, in the universal syllogisms of the First figure (<i>Barbara</i>, <i>Celarent</i>),
 any of the particulars comprehended under the minor term may be
substituted in place of the minor term as subject of the conclusion, and
 the proof will hold good in regard to them. So, again, all or any of
the particulars comprehended in the middle term may be introduced as
subject of the conclusion in place of the minor term; and the conclusion
 will still remain true. In the Second figure, the change is admissible
only in regard to those particulars comprehended under the subject of
the conclusion or minor term, and not (at least upon the strength of the
 syllogism) in regard to those comprehended under the middle term.
Finally, wherever the conclusion is particular, the change is
admissible, though not by reason of the syllogism in regard to
particulars comprehended under the middle term; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>it is not admissible as regards the minor term, which is itself particular.<a name="FnAnchor6_3" href="#Footnote6_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

 Analyt. Prior. II. i. p. 53, a. 14-35. M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire,
following Pacius, justly remarks (note, p. 203 of his translation) that
the rule as to particulars breaks down in the cases of <i>Baroco</i>, <i>Disamis</i>, and <i>Bocardo</i>.</p>
<p>
On the chapter in general he remarks (note, p. 204):— “Cette théorie des
 conclusions diverses, soit patentes soit cachées, d’un même syllogisme,
 est surtout utile en dialectique, dans la discussion; où il faut faire
la plus grande attention à ce qu’on accorde à l’adversaire, soit
explicitement, soit implicitement.” This illustrates the observation
cited in the preceding note from the Scholiasts.</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle has hitherto regarded the Syllogism with a view to its <i>formal</i> characteristics: he now makes an important observation which bears upon its <i>matter</i>. Formally speaking, <span class="correction" title="amended from 'the the'">the</span>
 two premisses are always assumed to be true; but in any real case of
syllogism (form and matter combined) it is possible that either one or
both may be false. Now, Aristotle remarks that if both the premisses are
 true (the syllogism being correct in form), the conclusion must of
necessity be true; but that if either or both the premisses are false,
the conclusion need not necessarily be false likewise. The premisses
being false, the conclusion may nevertheless be true; but it will not be
 true because of or by reason of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor6_4" href="#Footnote6_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>
The true conclusion is not true by reason of these false premisses, but
by reason of certain other premisses which are true, and which may be
produced to demonstrate it. Compare Analyt. Poster. I. ii. p. 71, b. 19.</p></div>
<p>
First, he would prove that if the premisses be true, the conclusion must
 be true also; but the proof that he gives does not seem more evident
than the <i>probandum</i> itself. Assume that if A exists, B must exist
also: it follows from hence (he argues) that if B does not exist,
neither can A exist; which he announces as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, seeing that it contradicts the fundamental supposition of the existence of A.<a name="FnAnchor6_5" href="#Footnote6_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Here the <i>probans</i> is indeed equally evident with the <i>probandum</i>,
 but not at all more evident; one who disputes the latter, will dispute
the former also. Nothing is gained in the way of proof by making either
of them dependent on the other. Both of them are alike self-evident;
that is, if a man hesitates to admit either of them, you have no means
of removing his scruples except by inviting him to try the general maxim
 upon as many particular cases as he chooses, and to see whether it does
 not hold good without a single exception. </p>

<p>
In regard to the case here put forward as illustration, Aristotle has an observation which shows his anxiety to maintain <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>the
 characteristic principles of the Syllogism; one of which principles he
had declared to be — That nothing less than three terms and two
propositions, could warrant the inferential step from premisses to
conclusion. In the present case he assumed, If A exists, then B must
exist; giving only one premiss as ground for the inference. This (he
adds) does not contravene what has been laid down before; for A in the
case before us represents two propositions conceived in conjunction.<a name="FnAnchor6_6" href="#Footnote6_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Here he has given the type of hypothetical reasoning; not recognizing it as a variety <i>per se</i>,
 nor following it out into its different forms (as his successors did
after him), but resolving it into the categorical syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor6_7" href="#Footnote6_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 He however conveys very clearly the cardinal principle of all
hypothetical inference — That if the antecedent be true, the consequent
must be true also, but not <i>vice versâ</i>; if the consequent be false, the antecedent must be false also, but not <i>vice versâ</i>. </p>

 Aristotle, it should be remarked, uses the word &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, not in the
 sense which it subsequently acquired, as the antithesis of &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;
in application to the proposition and syllogism, but in the sense of
affirmative as opposed to &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;.</p></div>
<p>
Having laid down the principle, that the conclusion may be true, though
one or both the premisses are false, Aristotle proceeds, at great
length, to illustrate it in its application to each of the three
syllogistic figures.<a name="FnAnchor6_8" href="#Footnote6_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> No portion of the Analytica is traced out more perspicuously than the exposition of this most important logical doctrine.</p>

<p>
It is possible (he then continues, again at considerable length) to invert the syllogism and to demonstrate <i>in a circle</i>.
 That is, you may take the conclusion as premiss for a new syllogism,
together with one of the old premisses, transposing its terms; and thus
you may demonstrate the other premiss. You may do this successively,
first with the major, to demonstrate the minor; next, with the minor, to
 demonstrate the major. Each of the premisses will thus in turn be made a
 demonstrated conclusion; and the circle will be complete. But this can
be done perfectly only in <i>Barbara</i>, and when, besides, all the
three terms of the syllogism reciprocate with each other, or are
co-extensive in import; so that each of the two premisses admits of
being simply converted. In all other cases, the process of circular
demonstration, where possible at all, is more or less imperfect.<a name="FnAnchor6_9" href="#Footnote6_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>
Having thus shown under what conditions the conclusion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>can
 be employed for the demonstration of the premisses, Aristotle proceeds
to state by what transformation it can be employed for the refutation of
 them. This he calls <i>converting</i> the syllogism; a most inconvenient use of the term <i>convert</i>
 (&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;), since he had already assigned to that same term more
than one other meaning, distinct and different, in logical procedure.<a name="FnAnchor6_10" href="#Footnote6_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> What it here means is <i>reversing</i>
 the conclusion, so as to exchange it either for its contrary, or for
its contradictory; then employing this reversed proposition as a new
premiss, along with one of the previous premisses, so as to disprove the
 other of the previous premisses — <i>i.e.</i> to prove its contrary or
contradictory. The result will here be different, according to the
manner in which the conclusion is reversed; according as you exchange it
 for its contrary or its contradictory. Suppose that the syllogism
demonstrated is: A belongs to all B, B belongs to all C; <i>Ergo</i>, A belongs to all C (<i>Barbara</i>). Now, if we reverse this conclusion by taking its <i>contrary</i>,
 A belongs to no C, and if we combine this as a new premiss with the
major of the former syllogism, A belongs to all B, we shall obtain as a
conclusion B belongs to no C; which is the <i>contrary</i> of the minor, in the form <i>Camestres</i>. If, on the other hand, we reverse the conclusion by taking its <i>contradictory</i>,
 A does not belong to all C, and combine this with the same major, we
shall have as conclusion, B does not belong to all C; which is the <i>contradictory</i> of the minor, and in the form <i>Baroco</i>: though in the one case as in the other the minor is disproved. The major is <i>contradictorily</i>
 disproved, whether it be the contrary or the contradictory of the
conclusion that is taken along with the minor to form the new syllogism;
 but still the form varies from <i>Felapton</i> to <i>Bocardo</i>.
Aristotle shows farther how the same process applies to the other modes
of the First, and to the modes of the Second and Third figures.<a name="FnAnchor6_11" href="#Footnote6_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 The new syllogism, obtained by this process of reversal, is always in a
 different figure from the syllogism reversed. Thus syllogisms in the
First figure are reversed by the Second and Third; those in the second,
by the First and Third; those in the Third, by the First and Second.<a name="FnAnchor6_12" href="#Footnote6_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>
Of this reversing process, one variety is what is called the <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>;
 in which the conclusion is reversed by taking its contradictory (never
its contrary), and then joining this last with one of the premisses, in
order to prove the contradictory<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span> or contrary of the other premiss.<a name="FnAnchor6_13" href="#Footnote6_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>
 is distinguished from the other modes of reversal by these
characteristics: (1) That it takes the contradictory, and not the
contrary, of the conclusion; (2) That it is destined to meet the case
where an opponent declines to admit the conclusion; whereas the other
cases of reversion are only intended as confirmatory evidence towards a
person who already admits the conclusion; (3) That it does not appeal to
 or require any concession on the part of the opponent; for if he
declines to admit the conclusion, you presume, as a matter of course,
that he must adhere to the contradictory of the conclusion; and you
therefore take this contradictory for granted (without asking his
concurrence) as one of the bases of a new syllogism; (4) That it
presumes as follows:— When, by the contradictory of the conclusion
joined with one of the premisses, you have demonstrated the opposite of
the other premiss, the original conclusion itself is shown to be beyond
all impeachment on the score of form, <i>i.e.</i> beyond impeachment by
any one who admits the premisses. You assume to be true, for the
occasion, the very proposition which you mean finally to prove false;
your purpose in the new syllogism is, not to demonstrate the original
conclusion, but to prove it to be true by demonstrating its
contradictory to be false.<a name="FnAnchor6_14" href="#Footnote6_14"><span class="sp"><span class="correction" title="missing in 2nd edition">14</span></span></a></p>

By the <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> you can in all the three figures
demonstrate all the four varieties of conclusion, universal and
particular, affirmative and negative; with the single exception, that
you cannot by this method demonstrate in the First figure the Universal
Affirmative.<a name="FnAnchor6_15" href="#Footnote6_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 With this exception, every true conclusion admits of being demonstrated
 by either of the two ways, either directly and ostensively, or by
reduction to the impossible.<a name="FnAnchor6_16" href="#Footnote6_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>
In the Second and Third figures, though not in the First, it is possible
 to obtain conclusions even from two premisses which are contradictory
or contrary to each other; but the conclusion will, as a matter of
course, be a self-contradictory one. Thus if in the Second figure you
have the two premisses — All Science is good; No Science is good — you
get the conclusion (in <i>Camestres</i>), No Science is Science. In opposed propositions, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>the
 same predicate must be affirmed and denied of the same subject in one
of the three different forms — All and None, All and Not All, Some and
None. This shows why such conclusions cannot be obtained in the First
figure; for it is the characteristic of that figure that the middle term
 must be predicate in one premiss, and subject in the other.<a name="FnAnchor6_17" href="#Footnote6_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 In dialectic discussion it will hardly be possible to get contrary or
contradictory premisses conceded by the adversary immediately after each
 other, because he will be sure to perceive the contradiction: you must
mask your purpose by asking the two questions not in immediate
succession, but by introducing other questions between the two, or by
other indirect means as suggested in the Topica.<a name="FnAnchor6_18" href="#Footnote6_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>

Aristotle now passes to certain general heads of Fallacy, or general
liabilities to Error, with which the syllogizing process is beset. What
the reasoner undertakes is, to demonstrate the conclusion before him,
and to demonstrate it in the natural and appropriate way; that is, from
premisses both more evident in themselves and logically prior to the
conclusion. Whenever he fails thus to demonstrate, there is error of
some kind; but he may err in several ways: (1) He may produce a
defective or informal syllogism; (2) His premisses may be more
unknowable than his conclusion, or equally unknowable; (3) His
premisses, instead of being logically prior to the conclusion, may be
logically posterior to it.<a name="FnAnchor6_19" href="#Footnote6_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

<p>
Distinct from all these three, however, Aristotle singles out and dwells upon another mode of error, which he calls <i>Petitio Principii</i>. Some truths, the <i>principia</i>,
 are by nature knowable through or in themselves, others are knowable
only through other things. If you confound this distinction, and ask or
assume something of the latter class as if it belonged to the former,
you commit a <i>Petitio Principii</i>. You may commit it either by assuming at once that which ought to be demonstrated, or by assuming, as if it were a <i>principium</i>, something else among those matters which in natural propriety would be demonstrated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>by means of a <i>principium</i>.
 Thus, there is (let us suppose) a natural propriety that C shall be
demonstrated through A; but you, overlooking this, demonstrate B through
 C, and A through B. By thus inverting the legitimate order, you do what
 is tantamount to demonstrating A through itself; for your demonstration
 will not hold unless you assume A at the beginning, in order to arrive
at C. This is a mistake made not unfrequently, and especially by some
who define parallel lines; for they give a definition which cannot be
understood unless parallel lines be presupposed.<a name="FnAnchor6_20" href="#Footnote6_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

 is, in the phrase of Aristotle, not &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, but &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8135;
 &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; or &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8134;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; (xvi. p. 64, b. 28, 34).</p></div>
<p>
When the problem is such, that it is uncertain whether A can be
predicated either of C or of B, if you then assume that A is predicable
of B, you may perhaps not commit <i>Petitio Principii</i>, but you
certainly fail in demonstrating the problem; for no demonstration will
hold where the premiss is equally uncertain with the conclusion. But if,
 besides, the case be such, that B is identical with C, that is, either
co-extensive and reciprocally convertible with C, or related to C as
genus or species, — in either of these cases you commit <i>Petitio Principii</i> by assuming that A may be predicated of B.<a name="FnAnchor6_21" href="#Footnote6_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 For seeing that B reciprocates with C, you might just as well
demonstrate that A is predicable of B, because it is predicable of C;
that is, you might demonstrate the major premiss by means of the minor
and the conclusion, as well as you can demonstrate the conclusion by
means of the major and the minor premiss. If you cannot so demonstrate
the major premiss, this is not because the structure of the syllogism
forbids it, but because the predicate of the major premiss is more
extensive than the subject thereof. If it be co-extensive and
convertible with the subject, we shall have a circular proof of three
propositions in which each may be alternately premiss and conclusion.
The like will be the case, if the <i>Petitio Principii</i> is in the
minor premiss and not in the major. In the First syllogistic figure it
may be in either of the premisses; in the Second figure it can only be
in the minor premiss, and that only in one mode (<i>Camestres</i>) of the figure.<a name="FnAnchor6_22" href="#Footnote6_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>The essence of <i>Petitio Principii</i> consists in this, that you exhibit as true <i>per se</i> that which is not really true <i>per se</i>.<a name="FnAnchor6_23" href="#Footnote6_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 You may commit this fault either in Demonstration, when you assume for
true what is not really true, or in Dialectic, when you assume as
probable and conformable to authoritative opinion what is not really so.<a name="FnAnchor6_24" href="#Footnote6_24"><span class="sp"><span class="correction" title="missing in 2nd edition">24</span></span></a></p>

<p>
This chapter, in which Aristotle declares the nature of Petitio
Principii, is obscure and difficult to follow. It has been explained at
some length, first by Philoponus in the Scholia (p. 192, a. 35, b. 24),
afterwards by Julius Pacius (p. 376, whose explanation is followed by M.
 B. St. Hilaire, p. 288), and by Waitz, (I. p. 514). But the translation
 and comment given by Mr. Poste appear to me the best: “Assuming the
conclusion to be affirmative, let us examine a syllogism in Barbara:— </p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All B is A. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All C is B. <br>
&#8756;&nbsp; All C is A.</blockquote>
<p class="noind">
And let us first suppose that the major premiss is a Petitio Principii; <i>i.e.</i> that the proposition <i>All B is A</i> is identical with the proposition <i>All C is A</i>. This can only be because the terms B and C are identical. Next, let us suppose that the minor premiss is a Petitio Principii: <i>i.e.</i> that the proposition <i>All C is B</i> is identical with the proposition <i>All C is A</i>.
 This can only be because B and A are identical. The identity of the
terms is, their convertibility or their sequence (&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;, &#7957;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;). This
 however requires some limitation; for as the major is always predicated
 (&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;, &#7957;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;) of the middle, and the middle of the minor, if this
were enough to constitute Petitio Principii, every syllogism with a
problematical premiss would be a Petitio Principii.” (See the Appendix
A, pp. 178-183, attached to Mr. Poste’s edition of Aristotle’s
Sophistici Elenchi.) </p>
<p>
Compare, about Petitio Principii, Aristot. Topic. VIII. xiii. p. 162, b.
 34, in which passage Aristotle gives to the fallacy called Petitio
Principii a still larger sweep than what he assigns to it in the
Analytica Priora. Mr. Poste’s remark is perfectly just, that according
to the above passage in the Analytica, every syllogism with a
problematical (<i>i.e.</i> real as opposed to verbal) premiss would be a
 Petitio Principii; that is, all real deductive reasoning, in the
syllogistic form, would be a Petitio Principii. To this we may add,
that, from the passage above referred to in the Topica, all inductive
reasoning also (reasoning from parts to whole) would involve Petitio
Principii.</p>
<p>
Mr. Poste’s explanation of this difficult passage brings into view the
original and valuable exposition made by Mr. John Stuart Mill of the
Functions and Logical Value of the Syllogism. — System of Logic, Book
II. ch. iii. sect 2:— ”It must be granted, that in every syllogism,
considered as an argument to prove the conclusion, there is a Petitio
Principii,” &amp;c.</p>
<p>
Petitio Principii, if ranked among the Fallacies, can hardly be extended
 beyond the first of the five distinct varieties enumerated in the
Topica, VIII. xiii.</p></div>

<p>
We must be careful to note, that when Aristotle speaks of a <i>principium</i>
 as knowable in itself, or true in itself, he does not mean that it is
innate, or that it starts up in the mind ready made without any gradual
building up or preparation. What he means is, that it is not
demonstrable deductively from anything else prior or more knowable by
nature than itself. He declares (as we shall see) that <i>principia</i> are acquired, and mainly by Induction.</p>
<p>
Next to <i>Petitio Principii</i>, Aristotle indicates another fallacious or erroneous procedure in dialectic debate; misconception or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>misstatement of the real grounds on which a conclusion rests — <i>Non per Hoc</i>.
 You may impugn the thesis (set up by the respondent) directly, by
proving syllogistically its contrary or contradictory; or you may also
impugn it indirectly by <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>; <i>i.e.</i> you
prove by syllogism some absurd conclusion, which you contend to be
necessarily true, if the thesis is admitted. Suppose you impugn it in
the first method, or directly, by a syllogism containing only two
premisses and a conclusion: <i>Non per Hoc</i> is inapplicable here, for
 if either premiss is disallowed, the conclusion is unproved; the
respondent cannot meet you except by questioning one or both of the
premisses of your impugning syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor6_25" href="#Footnote6_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> But if you proceed by the second method or indirectly, <i>Non per Hoc</i>
 may become applicable; for there may then be more than two premisses,
and he may, while granting that the absurd conclusion is correctly made
out, contend that the truth or falsehood of his thesis is noway
implicated in it. He declares (in Aristotle’s phrase) that the absurdity
 or falsehood just made out does not follow as a consequence from his
thesis, but from other premisses independent thereof; that it would
stand equally proved, even though his thesis were withdrawn.<a name="FnAnchor6_26" href="#Footnote6_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
 In establishing the falsehood or absurdity you must take care that it
shall be one implicated with or dependent upon his thesis. It is this
last condition that he (the respondent) affirms to be wanting.<a name="FnAnchor6_27" href="#Footnote6_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

 Mr. Poste, who has extracted and illustrated it in Appendix B. (p. 190)
 of the notes to his edition of the Sophistici Elenchi. The six
illustrative diagrams given by Julius Pacius afford great help, though
the two first of them appear to me incorrectly printed, as to the
brackets connecting the different propositions.</p></div>

Instead of the preposition &#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;, Aristotle on two occasions employs &#948;&#953;&#940; — &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; <span class="gesp">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> — p. 65, b. 33, p. 66, a. 3.</p>

<p>
Aristotle tells us that this was a precaution which the defender of a
thesis was obliged often to employ in dialectic debate, in order to
guard against abuse or misapplication of <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> on the part of opponents, who (it appears) sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>took
 credit for success, when they had introduced and demonstrated some
absurd conclusion that had little or no connection with the thesis.<a name="FnAnchor6_28" href="#Footnote6_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 But even when the absurd conclusion is connected with the thesis
continuously, by a series of propositions each having a common term with
 the preceding, in either the ascending or the descending scale, we have
 here more than three propositions, and the absurd conclusion may
perhaps be proved by the other premisses, without involving the thesis.
In this case the respondent will meet you with <i>Non per Hoc</i>:<a name="FnAnchor6_29" href="#Footnote6_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 he will point out that his thesis is not one of the premisses requisite
 for demonstrating your conclusion, and is therefore not overthrown by
the absurdity thereof. Perhaps the thesis may be false, but you have not
 shown it to be so, since it is not among the premisses necessary for
proving your <i>absurdum</i>. An <i>absurdum</i> may sometimes admit of being demonstrated by several lines of premisses,<a name="FnAnchor6_30" href="#Footnote6_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
 each involving distinct falsehood. Every false conclusion implies
falsity in one or more syllogistic or prosyllogistic premisses that have
 preceded it, and is <i>owing to</i> or occasioned by this first falsehood.<a name="FnAnchor6_31" href="#Footnote6_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

He makes express reference to the Topica (<i>i.e.</i>
 to the fifth chapter of Sophist. Elenchi, which he regards as part of
the Topica), where the same fallacy is designated by a different title, <i>Non Causa pro Causâ</i>,

Anal. Priora was composed later than the fifth chapter of Soph. El.;
whether this is true of the two treatises as wholes is not so certain. I
 think it probable that the change of designation for the same fallacy
was deliberately adopted. It is an improvement to dismiss the vague term
 Cause.</p></div>

In impugning the thesis and in extracting from your opponent the proper
concessions to enable you to do so, you will take care to put the
interrogations in such form and order as will best disguise the final
conclusion which you aim at establishing. If you intend to arrive at it
through preliminary syllogisms (prosyllogisms), you will ask assent to
the necessary premisses in a confused or inverted order, and will
refrain from enunciating at once the conclusion from any of them.
Suppose that you wish to end by showing that A may be predicated of F,
and suppose that there must be intervening steps through B, C, D, E. You
 will not put the questions in this regular order, but will first ask
him to grant that A may be predicated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>of
 B; next, that D may be predicated of E; afterwards, that B may be
predicated of C, &amp;c. You will thus try to obtain all the concessions
 requisite for your final conclusion, before he perceives your drift. If
 you can carry your point by only one syllogism, and have only one
middle term to get conceded, you will do well to put the middle term
first in your questions. This is the best way to conceal your purpose
from the respondent.<a name="FnAnchor6_32" href="#Footnote6_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> </p>

Pacius, p. 385. Since the middle term does not appear in the conclusion,
 the respondent is less likely to be prepared for the conclusion that
you want to establish. To put the middle term first, in enunciating the
Syllogism, is regarded by Aristotle as a perverted and embarrassing
order, yet it is the received practice among modern logicians.</p></div>
<p>
It will be his business to see that he is not thus tripped up in the syllogistic process.<a name="FnAnchor6_33" href="#Footnote6_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
 If you ask the questions in the order above indicated, without
enunciating your preliminary conclusions, he must take care not to
concede the same term twice, either as predicate, or as subject, or as
both; for you can arrive at no conclusion unless he grants you a middle
term; and no term can be employed as middle, unless it be repeated
twice. Knowing the conditions of a conclusion in each of the three
figures, he will avoid making such concessions as will empower you to
conclude in any one of them.<a name="FnAnchor6_34" href="#Footnote6_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> If the thesis which he defends is affirmative, the <i>elenchus</i>
 by which you impugn it must be a negative; so that he will be careful
not to concede the premisses for a negative conclusion. If his thesis be
 negative, your purpose will require you to meet him by an affirmative;
accordingly he must avoid granting you any sufficient premisses for an
affirmative conclusion. He may thus make it impossible for you to prove
syllogistically the contrary or contradictory of his thesis; and it is
in proving this that the <i>elenchus</i> or refutation consists. If he
will not grant you any affirmative proposition, nor any universal
proposition, you know, by the rules previously laid down, that no valid
syllogism can be constructed; since nothing can be inferred either from
two premisses both negative, or from two premisses both particular.<a name="FnAnchor6_35" href="#Footnote6_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>

to his translation of the Analytica Priora, p. 303.</p></div>

 Ibid. xx. p. 66, b. 4-17. The reader will observe how completely this
advice given by Aristotle is shaped for the purpose of obtaining victory
 in the argument and how he leaves out of consideration both the truth
of what the opponent asks to be conceded, and the belief entertained by
the defendant. This is exactly the procedure which he himself makes a
ground of contemptuous reproach against the Sophists.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>We
have already seen that error may arise by wrong enunciation or
arrangement of the terms of a syllogism, that is, defects in its form;
but sometimes also, even when the form is correct, error may arise from
wrong belief as to the matters affirmed or denied.<a name="FnAnchor6_36" href="#Footnote6_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
 Thus the same predicate may belong, immediately and essentially, alike
to several distinct subjects; but you may believe (what is the truth)
that it belongs to one of them, and you may at the same time believe
(erroneously) that it does not belong to another. Suppose that A is
predicable essentially both of B and C, and that A, B, and C, are all
predicable essentially of D. You may know that A is predicable of all B,
 and that B is predicable of all D; but you may at the same time believe
 (erroneously) that A is not predicable of any C, and that C is
predicable of all D. Under this state of knowledge and belief, you may
construct two valid syllogisms; the first (in <i>Barbara</i>, with B for its middle term) proving that A belongs to <i>all</i> D; the second (in <i>Celarent</i>, with C for its middle term) proving that A belongs to <i>no</i>
 D. The case will be the same, even if all the terms taken belong to the
 same ascending or descending logical series. Here, then, you <i>know</i> one proposition; yet you <i>believe</i> the proposition contrary to it.<a name="FnAnchor6_37" href="#Footnote6_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 How can such a mental condition be explained? It would, indeed, be an
impossibility, if the middle term of the two syllogisms were the same,
and if the premisses of the one syllogism thus contradicted directly and
 in terms, the premisses of the other: should that happen, you cannot
know one side of the alternative and believe the other. But if the
middle term be different, so that the contradiction between the
premisses of the one syllogism and those of the other, is not direct,
there is no impossibility. Thus, you know that A is predicable of all B,
 and B of all D; while you believe at the same time that A is predicable
 of <i>no</i> C, and C of <i>all</i> D; the middle term being in one syllogism B, in the other, C.<a name="FnAnchor6_38" href="#Footnote6_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
 This last form of error is analogous to what often occurs in respect to
 our knowledge of particulars. You know that A belongs to all B, and B
to all C; you know, therefore, that A belongs to all C. Yet you may <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>perhaps
 be ignorant of the existence of C. Suppose A to denote equal to two
right angles; B, to be the triangle generally; C, a particular visible
triangle. You know A B the universal proposition; yet you may at the
same time believe that C does not exist; and thus it may happen that you
 know, and do not know, the same thing at the same time. For, in truth,
the knowledge, that every triangle has its three angles equal to two
right angles, is not (as a mental fact) simple and absolute, but has two
 distinct aspects; one as concerns the universal, the other as concerns
the several particulars. Now, assuming the case above imagined, you
possess the knowledge in the first of these two aspects, but not in the
second; so that the apparent contrariety between knowledge and no
knowledge is not real.<a name="FnAnchor6_39" href="#Footnote6_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
 And in this sense the doctrine of Plato in the Menon is partially true —
 that learning is reminiscence. We can never know beforehand particular
cases <i>per se</i>; but in proportion as we extend our induction to each case <span class="correction" title="amended from 'suscessively'">successively</span>,
 we, as it were, recognize that, which we knew beforehand as a general
truth, to be realized in each. Thus when we ascertain the given figure
before us to be a triangle, we know immediately that its three angles
are equal to two right angles.<a name="FnAnchor6_40" href="#Footnote6_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

<p>
We thus, by help of the universal, acquire a theoretical knowledge of
particulars, but we do not know them by the special observation properly
 belonging to each particular case: so that we may err in respect to
them without any positive contrariety between our cognition and our
error; since what we know is the universal, while what we err in is the
particular. We may even know that A is predicable of all B, and that B
is predicable of all C; and yet we may believe that A is not predicable
of C. We may know that every mule is barren, and that the animal before
us is a mule, yet still we may believe her to be in foal; for perhaps we
 may never have combined in our minds the particular case along with the
 universal proposition.<a name="FnAnchor6_41" href="#Footnote6_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> <i>A fortiori</i>,
 therefore, we may make the like mistake, if we know the universal only,
 and do not know the particular. And this is perfectly possible. For
take any one of the visible particular instances, even one which we have
 already inspected, so soon as it is out of sight we do not know it by
actual and present <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>cognition;
 we only know it, partly from the remembrance of past special
inspection, partly from the universal under which it falls.<a name="FnAnchor6_42" href="#Footnote6_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
 We may know in one, or other, or all, of these three distinct ways:
either by the universal; or specially (as remembered): or by combination
 of both — actual and present cognition, that is, by the application of a
 foreknown generality to a case submitted to our senses. And as we may
know in each of these three ways, so we may also err or be deceived in
each of the same three ways.<a name="FnAnchor6_43" href="#Footnote6_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
 It is therefore quite possible that we may know, and that we may err or
 be deceived about the same thing, and that, too, without any
contrariety. This is what happens when we know both the two premisses of
 the syllogism, but have never reflected on them before, nor brought
them into conjunction in our minds. When we believe that the mule before
 us is in foal, we are destitute of the actual knowledge; yet our
erroneous belief is not for that reason contrary to knowledge; for an
erroneous belief, contrary to the universal proposition, must be
represented by a counter-syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor6_44" href="#Footnote6_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

Complete cognition (&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, according to the view here set forth)
consists of one mental act corresponding to the major premiss; another
corresponding to the minor; and a third including both the two in
conscious juxta-position. The third implies both the first and the
second; but the first and the second do not necessarily imply the third,
 nor does either of them imply the other; though a person cognizant of
the first is <i>in a certain way, and to a certain extent</i>, cognizant of <i>all</i>
 the particulars to which the second applies. Thus the person who knows
Ontology (the most universal of all sciences, &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8087; &#8004;&#957;), knows <i>in a certain way</i> all <i>scibilia</i>.

erroneous belief, where a man believes the contrary of a true

It is impossible, however, for a man to believe that one contrary is
predicable of its contrary, or that one contrary is identical with its
contrary, essentially and as an universal proposition; though he may
believe that it is so by accident (<i>i.e.</i> in some particular case, by reason of the peculiarities of that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>case).

This distinction is illustrated by what we read in Plato, Republic, v.
pp. 478-479. The impossibility of believing that one contrary is
identical with its contrary, is maintained by Sokrates in Plato,
Theætetus, p. 190, B-D, as a part of the long discussion respecting
&#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;: either there is no such thing as &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;, or a man may
know, and not know, the same thing, ibid. p. 196 C. Aristotle has here
tried to show in what sense this last-mentioned case is possible.</p></div>
<p>
Whenever (Aristotle next goes on to say) the extremes of a syllogism reciprocate or are co-extensive with each other (<i>i.e.</i> when the conclusion being affirmative is convertible simply), the middle term must reciprocate or be co-extensive with both.<a name="FnAnchor6_46" href="#Footnote6_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 If there be four terms (A, B, C, D), such that A reciprocates with B,
and C with D, and if either A or C must necessarily be predicable of
every subject; then it follows that either B or D must necessarily also
be predicable of every subject. Again, if either A or B must necessarily
 be predicable of every subject, but never both predicable of the same
at once; and if, either C or D must be predicable of every subject, but
never both predicable of the same at once; then, if A and C reciprocate,
 B and D will also reciprocate.<a name="FnAnchor6_47" href="#Footnote6_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 When A is predicable of all B and all C, but of no other subject
besides, and when B is predicable of all C, then A and B must
reciprocate with each other, or be co-extensive with each other; that
is, B may be predicated of every subject of which A can be predicated,
though B cannot be predicated of A itself.<a name="FnAnchor6_48" href="#Footnote6_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> Again, when A and B are predicable of all C, and when C reciprocates with B, then A must also be predicable of all B.<a name="FnAnchor6_49" href="#Footnote6_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote6_46" id="Footnote6_46"></a><a href="#FnAnchor6_46">46</a></span> Ibid. II. xxii. p. 67, b. 27, seq. In this chapter Aristotle introduces us to affirmative universal propositions convertible <i>simpliciter</i>;
 that is, in which the predicate must be understood to be distributed as
 well as the subject. Here, then, the quantity of the predicate is
determined in thought. This is (as Julius Pacius remarks, p. 371) in
order to lay down principles for the resolution of Induction into
Syllogism, which is to be explained in the next chapter. In these
peculiar propositions, the reason urged by Sir W. Hamilton for his
favourite precept of verbally indicating the quantity of the predicate,
is well founded as a fact: though <i>he</i> says that in <i>all</i> propositions the quantity of the predicate is understood in thought, which I hold to be incorrect.</p>
<p>
We may remark that this recognition by Aristotle of a class of universal
 affirmative propositions in which predicate and subject reciprocate,
contrived in order to force Induction into the syllogistic framework, is
 at variance with his general view both of reciprocating propositions
and of Induction. He tells us (Analyt. Post. I. iii. p. 73, a. 18) that
such reciprocating propositions are very rare, which would not be true
if they are taken to represent every Induction; and he forbids us
emphatically to annex the mark of universality to the predicate; which
he has no right to do, if he calls upon us to reason on the predicate as
 distributed (Analyt. Prior. I. xxvii., p. 43, b. 17; De Interpret. p.
17, b. 14).</p></div>

 suppose two pairs of opposites, A and B, C and D; let A be more
eligible than B, and D more eligible than C. Then, if A C is more
eligible than B D, A will also be more eligible than D. For A is as much
 worthy of pursuit as B is worthy of avoidance, they being two
opposites; the like also respecting C and D. If then A and D are equally
 worthy of pursuit, B and C are equally worthy of avoidance; for each is
 equal to each. Accordingly the two together, A C, will be equal to the
two together, B D. But this would be contrary to the supposition; since
we assumed A to be more eligible than B, and D to be more eligible than
C. It will be seen that on this supposition A is more worthy of pursuit
than D, and that C is less worthy of avoidance than B; the greater good
and the lesser evil being more eligible than the lesser good and the
greater evil. Now apply this to a particular case of a lover, so far
forth as lover. Let A represent his possession of those qualities which
inspire reciprocity of love towards him in the person beloved; B, the
absence of those qualities; D, the attainment of actual sexual
enjoyment; C, the non-attainment thereof. In this state of
circumstances, it is evident that A is more eligible or worthy of
preference than D. The being loved is a greater object of desire to the
lover <i>qua</i> lover than sexual gratification; it is the real end or
purpose to which love aspires; and sexual gratification is either not at
 all the purpose, or at best only subordinate and accessory. The like is
 the case with our other appetites and pursuits.<a name="FnAnchor6_50" href="#Footnote6_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a></p>

the conclusion which he here emphatically asserts; but I am surprised
that he should consider it to be proved by the reasoning that precedes.</p>

beautiful youth: (see Plato, Sympos. pp. 218-222; also Xenophon, Sympos.

Such is the relation of the terms of a syllogism in regard to
reciprocation and antithesis. Let it next be understood that the canons
hitherto laid down belong not merely to demonstrative and dialectic
syllogisms, but to rhetorical and other syllogisms also; all of which
must be constructed in one or other of the three figures. In fact, every
 case of belief on evidence, whatever be the method followed, must be
tested by these same canons. We believe everything either through
Syllogism or upon Induction.<a name="FnAnchor6_51" href="#Footnote6_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> </p>

says) is a process in which we invert the order of the terms. Instead of
 concluding from the major through the middle to the minor (<i>i.e.</i>
concluding that the major is predicable of the minor), we now begin from
 the minor and conclude from thence through the middle to the major (<i>i.e.</i> we conclude that the major is predicable of the middle).<a name="FnAnchor6_52" href="#Footnote6_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
 In Syllogism as hitherto described, we concluded that A the major was
predicable of C the minor, through the middle B; in the Syllogism from
Induction we begin by affirming that A the major is predicable of C the
minor; next, we affirm that B the middle is also predicable of C the
minor. The two premisses, standing thus, correspond to the Third figure
of the Syllogism (as explained in the preceding pages) and would not
therefore by themselves justify anything more than a <i>particular</i>
affirmative conclusion. But we reinforce them by introducing an
extraneous assumption:— That the minor C is co-extensive with the middle
 B, and comprises the entire aggregate of individuals of which B is the
universal or class-term. By reason of this assumption the minor
proposition becomes convertible simply, and we are enabled to infer
(according to the last preceding chapter) an universal affirmative
conclusion, that the major term A is predicable of the middle term B.
Thus, let A (the major term) mean the class-term, long-lived; let B (the
 middle term) mean the class-term, bile-less, or the having no bile; let
 C (the minor term) mean the individual animals — man, horse, mule,
&amp;c., coming under the class-term B, bile-less.<a name="FnAnchor6_53" href="#Footnote6_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> We are supposed to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>know, or to have ascertained, that A may be predicated of all C; (<i>i.e.</i> that all men, horses, mules, &amp;c., are long-lived); we farther <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>know that B is predicable of all C (<i>i.e.</i>
 that men, horses, mules, &amp;c., belong to the class bile-less). Here,
 then, we have two premisses in the Third syllogistic figure, which in
themselves would warrant us in drawing the particular affirmative
conclusion, that A is predicable of <i>some</i> B, but no more. Accordingly, Aristotle directs us to supplement these premisses<a name="FnAnchor6_54" href="#Footnote6_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> by the extraneous <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>assumption
 or postulate, that C the minor comprises all the individual animals
that are bile-less, or all those that correspond to the class-term B; in
 other words, the assumption, that B the middle does not denote any more
 individuals than those which are covered by C the minor — that B the
middle does not stretch beyond or overpass C the minor.<a name="FnAnchor6_55" href="#Footnote6_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> Having the two premisses, and this postulate besides, we acquire the right to conclude that A is predicable of <i>all</i>
 B. But we could not draw that conclusion from the premisses alone, or
without the postulate which declares B and C to be co-extensive. The
conclusion, then, becomes a particular exemplification of the general
doctrine laid down in the last chapter, respecting the reciprocation of
extremes and the consequences thereof. We thus see that this very
peculiar Syllogism from Induction is (as indeed Aristotle himself
remarks) the opposite or antithesis of a genuine Syllogism. It has no
proper middle term; the conclusion in which it results is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>the first or major proposition, the characteristic feature of which it is to be <i>immediate</i>,
 or not to be demonstrated through a middle term. Aristotle adds that
the genuine Syllogism, which demonstrates through a middle term, is by
nature prior and more effective as to cognition; but that the Syllogism
from Induction is <i>to us</i> plainer and clearer.<a name="FnAnchor6_56" href="#Footnote6_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a></p>

Waitz in his note (p. 532) says: “Fit Inductio, cum per minorem terminum demonstratur <i>medium prædicari de majore</i>.” This is an erroneous explanation. It should have been: “demonstratur <i>majorem prædicari de medio</i>.”

&#964;&#8183; &#914; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;.</p>
<p>
I have transcribed this Greek text as it stands in the editions of
Buhle, Bekker, Waitz, and F. Didot. Yet, notwithstanding these high
authorities, I venture to contend that it is not wholly correct; that
the word <span class="gesp">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, which I have emphasized,
is neither consistent with the context, nor suitable for the point which
 Aristotle is illustrating. Instead of <span class="gesp">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>,
 we ought in that place to read &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;; and I have given the sense of
the passage in my English text as if it did stand &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; in that place.</p>
<p>
I proceed to justify this change. If we turn back to the edition by
Julius Pacius (1584, p. 377), we find the text given as follows after
the word &#7969;&#956;&#943;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; (down to that word the text is the same): &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#8052; &#915; &#8005;&#955;&#8179;
&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;· &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#915; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;· &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#914;, &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957; &#967;&#959;&#955;&#942;&#957;,
&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8054; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#915;. &#949;&#7984; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#915; &#964;&#8183; &#914;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056;
&#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;, &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#964;&#8056; &#913; &#964;&#8183; &#914; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;. Earlier than Pacius, the edition of
Erasmus (Basil. 1550) has the same text in this chapter.</p>
<p>
Here it will be seen that in place of the words given in Waitz’s text, &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; <span class="gesp">&#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;, Pacius gives &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; <span class="gesp">&#964;&#8056; &#915;</span>
 &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;: annexing however to the letter &#915; an asterisk referring to
the margin, where we find the word &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; inserted in small letters,
seemingly as a various reading not approved by Pacius. And M. Barthélemy
 St. Hilaire has accommodated his French translation (p. 328) to the
text of Pacius: “Donc A est à C tout entier, car tout C est longève.”
Boethius in his Latin translation (p. 519) recognizes as his original
&#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;, but he alters the text in the words
immediately preceding:— “Ergo <i>toti B</i> (instead of <i>toti C</i>)
inest A, omne enim quod sine cholera est, longævum,” &amp;c. (p. 519).
The edition of Aldus (Venet. 1495) has the text conformable to the Latin
 of Boethius: &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#8052; &#914; &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;· &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;.
Three distinct Latin translations of the 16th century are adapted to the
 same text, viz., that of Vives and Valentinus (Basil. 1542); that
published by the Junta (Venet. 1552); and that of Cyriacus (Basil.
1563). Lastly, the two Greek editions of Sylburg (1587) and Casaubon
(Lugduni 1590), have the same text also: &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#8052; &#914; &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;· &#960;&#8118;&#957;
&#947;&#8048;&#961; [&#964;&#8056; &#915;] &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;. Casaubon prints in brackets the words
[&#964;&#8056; &#915;] before &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;.</p>
<p>
Now it appears to me that the text of Bekker and Waitz (though Waitz
gives it without any comment or explanation) is erroneous; neither
consisting with itself, nor conforming to the general view enunciated by
 Aristotle of the Syllogism from Induction. I have cited two distinct
versions, each different from this text, as given by the earliest
editors; in both the confusion appears to have been felt, and an attempt
 made to avoid it, though not successfully. </p>
<p>
Aristotle’s view of the Syllogism from Induction is very clearly
explained by M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire in the instructive notes of his
translation, pp. 326-328; also in his Preface, p. lvii.:— “L'induction
n’est au fond qu’un syllogisme dont le mineur et le moyen sont
d’extension égale. Du reste, il n’est qu’une seule manière dont le moyen
 et le mineur puissent être d’égale extension; c’est que le mineur se
compose de toutes les parties dont le moyen représente la totalité.
D’une part, tous les individus: de l’autre, l’espèce totale qu’ils
forment. L’intelligence fait aussitôt équation entre les deux termes
égaux.”</p>
<p>
According to the Aristotelian text, as given both by Pacius and the others, A, the major term, represents <i>longævum</i> (long-lived, the class-term or total); B, the middle term, represents <i>vacans bile</i> (bile-less, the class-term or total); C, the minor term, represents the aggregate individuals of the class <i>longævum</i>, man, horse, mule, &amp;c. </p>
<p>
Julius Pacius draws out the Inductive Syllogism, thus:— </p>
<blockquote>
1. Omnis homo, equus, asinus, &amp;c., est longævus.<br>
2. Omnis homo, equus, asinus, &amp;c., vacat bile.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergo:<br>
3. Quicquid vacat bile, est longævum.</blockquote>
<p>
Convertible into a Syllogism in Barbara:— </p>
<blockquote>
1. Omnis homo, equus, asinus, &amp;c., est longævus.<br>
2. Quicquid vacat bile, est homo, equus, asinus, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergo:<br>
3. Quicquid vacat bile, est longævum.</blockquote>
<p>
Here the force of the proof (or the possibility, in this exceptional
case, of converting a syllogism in the Third figure into another in <i>Barbara</i>
 of the First figure) depends upon the equation or co-extensiveness (not
 enunciated in the premisses, but assumed in addition to the premisses)
of the minor term C with the middle term B. But I contend that this is <i>not</i> the condition peremptorily required, or sufficient for proof, if we suppose C the minor term to represent <i>omne longævum</i>. We must understand C the minor term to represent <i>omne vacans bile</i>, or <i>quicquid vacat bile</i>: and unless we understand this, the proof fails. In other words, <i>homo, equus, asinus, &amp;c.</i> (the aggregate of individuals), must be co-extensive with the class-term bile-less or <i>vacans bile</i>: but they need not be co-extensive with the class-term long-lived or <i>longævum</i>. In the final conclusion, the subject <i>vacans bile</i> is distributed; but the predicate <i>longævum</i>
 is not distributed; this latter may include, besides all bile-less
animals, any number of other animals, without impeachment of the
syllogistic proof.</p>
<p>
Such being the case, I think that there is a mistake in the text as
given by all the editors, from Pacius down to Bekker and Waitz. What
they give, in setting out the terms of the Aristotelian Syllogism from
Induction, is: &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#969; &#964;&#8056; &#913; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;, &#964;&#8056; &#948;’ &#7952;&#966;’ &#8103; &#914;, &#964;&#8056; &#967;&#959;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#956;&#8052; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;, &#7952;&#966;’
 &#8103; &#948;&#8050; &#915;, <span class="gesp">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7989;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969;&#956;&#943;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;. Instead of which the text ought to run, &#7952;&#966;’ &#8103; &#948;&#8050; &#915;, <span class="gesp">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>,
 &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;. &#954;. &#7989;&#960;. &#954;. &#7969;&#956;&#943;. That these last words were the original text,
 is seen by the words immediately following: &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#8052; &#915; &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;. <span class="gesp">&#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>. For the reason thus assigned (in the particle &#947;&#940;&#961;) is irrelevant and unmeaning if &#915; designates &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; <span class="gesp">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, while it is pertinent and even indispensable if &#915; designates &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; <span class="gesp">&#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>.
 Pacius (or those whose guidance he followed in his text) appears to
have perceived the incongruity of the reason conveyed in the words &#960;&#8118;&#957;
&#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;; for he gives, instead of these words, &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; <span class="gesp">&#964;&#8056; &#915;</span>
 &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;. In this version the reason is indeed no longer incongruous,
but simply useless and unnecessary; for when we are told that A
designates the class <i>longævum</i>, and that &#915; designates the individual <i>longæva</i>,
 we surely require no reason from without to satisfy us that A is
predicable of all &#915;. The text, as translated by Boethius and others,
escapes that particular incongruity, though in another way, but it
introduces a version inadmissible on other grounds. Instead of &#964;&#8183; <span class="gesp">&#948;&#8052; &#915;</span> &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;, &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;, Boethius has &#964;&#8183; <span class="gesp">&#948;&#8052; &#914;</span>
 &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#913;, &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;. This cannot be accepted,
 because it enunciates the conclusion of the syllogism as if it were one
 of the premisses. We must remember that the conclusion of the
Aristotelian Syllogism from Induction is, that A is predicable of B, one
 of the premisses to prove it being that A is predicable of the minor
term C. But obviously we cannot admit as one of the premisses the
proposition that A may be predicated of B, since this proposition would
then be used as premiss to prove itself as conclusion. </p>
<p>
If we examine the Aristotelian Inductive Syllogism which is intended to conduct us to the final <i>probandum</i>,
 we shall see that the terms of it are incorrectly set out by Bekker and
 Waitz, when they give the minor term &#915; as designating &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;
&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957;. This last is not one of the three terms, nor has it any place
 in the syllogism. The three terms are: </p>
<blockquote>
1. A — major — the class-term or class &#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#959;&#957; — <i>longævum</i>.<br>
2. B — middle — the class term or class &#7940;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; — bile-less.<br>
3. C — minor — the individual bile-less animals, man, horse, &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>
There is no term in the syllogism corresponding to the individual <i>longæva</i>
 or long-lived animals; this last (I repeat) has no place in the
reasoning. We are noway concerned with the totality of long-lived
animals; all that the syllogism undertakes to prove is, that in and
among that totality all bile-less animals are included; whether there
are or are not other long-lived animals besides the bile-less, the
syllogism does not pretend to determine. The equation or
co-extensiveness required (as described by M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire in
his note) is not between the individual long-lived animals and the
class, bile-less animals (middle term), but between the aggregate of
individual animals known to be bile-less and the class, bile-less
animals. The real minor term, therefore, is (not the individual <i>long-lived</i> animals, but) the individual <i>bile-less</i> animals. The two premisses of the Inductive Syllogism will stand thus:— </p>
<blockquote>
Men, Horses, Mules, &amp;c., are long-lived (major).<br> Men, Horses, Mules, &amp;c., are bile-less (minor). </blockquote>
<p>
And, inasmuch as the subject of the minor proposition is co-extensive
with the predicate (which, if quantified according to Hamilton’s
phraseology, would be, <i>All</i> bile-less animals), so that the
proposition admits of being converted simply, — the middle term will
become the subject of the conclusion, All bileless animals are
long-lived.</p></div>

<p>
Julius Pacius translates this: “Si igitur convertatur &#964;&#8056; &#915; cum B, nec
medium excedat, necesse est &#964;&#8056; &#913; &#964;&#8183; &#914; inesse.” These Latin words include
 the same grammatical ambiguity as is found in the Greek original: <i>medium</i>, like &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;, may be either an accusative case governed by <i>excedat</i>, or a nominative case preceding <i>excedat</i>. The same may be said of the other Latin translations, from Boethius downwards. </p>
<p>
But M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire in his French translation, and Sir W.
Hamilton in his English translation (Lectures on Logic, Vol. II. iv. p.
358, Appendix), steer clear of this ambiguity. The former says: “Si donc
 C est réciproque à B, et qu’il ne dépasse pas le moyen, il est
nécessaire alors que A soit à B:” to the same purpose, Hamilton, <i>l. c.</i>
 These words are quite plain and unequivocal. Yet I do not think that
they convey the meaning of Aristotle. In my judgment, Aristotle meant to
 say: “If then C reciprocates with B, and if the middle term (B) does
not stretch beyond (the minor C), it is necessary that A should be
predicable of B.” To show that this must be the meaning, we have only to
 reflect on what C and B respectively designate. It is assumed that C
designates the sum of individual bile-less animals; and that B
designates the class or class-term bile-less, that is, the totality
thereof. Now the sum of individuals included in the minor (C) cannot
upon any supposition overpass the totality: but it may very possibly
fall short of totality; or (to state the same thing in other words) the
totality may possibly surpass the sum of individuals under survey, but
it cannot possibly fall short thereof. B is here the limit, and may
possibly stretch beyond C; but cannot stretch beyond B. Hence I contend
that the translations, both by M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire and Sir W.
Hamilton, take the wrong side in the grammatical alternative admissible
under the words &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;. The only doubt that could
possibly arise in the case was, whether the aggregate of individuals
designated by the minor did, or did not, reach up to the totality
designated by the middle term; or (changing the phrase) whether the
totality designated by the middle term did, or did not, stretch beyond
the aggregate of individuals designated by the minor. Aristotle
terminates this doubt by the words: “And if the middle term does <i>not</i>
 stretch beyond (the minor).” Of course the middle term does not stretch
 beyond, when the terms reciprocate; but when they do not reciprocate,
the middle term must be the <i>more</i> extensive of the two; it can <i>never</i> be the <i>less</i> extensive of the two, since the aggregate of individuals cannot possibly exceed totality, though it may fall short thereof. </p>

From Induction he proceeds to Example. You here take in (besides the
three terms, major, middle, and minor, of the Syllogism) a fourth term;
that is, a new particular case analogous to the minor. Your purpose here
 is to show — not, as in the ordinary Syllogism, that the major term is
predicable of the minor, but, as in the Inductive Syllogism — that the
major term is predicable of the middle term; and you prove this
conclusion, not (as in the Inductive Syllogism) through the minor term,
but through the new case or fourth term analogous to the minor.<a name="FnAnchor6_57" href="#Footnote6_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
 Let A represent evil or mischievous; B, war against neighbours,
generally; C, war of Athens against Thebes, an event to come and under
deliberation; D, war of Thebes against Phokis, a past event of which the
 issue is known to have been signally mischievous. You assume as known,
first, that A is predicable of D, <i>i.e.</i> that the war of Thebes against Phokis has been disastrous; next, that B is predicable both of C and of D, <i>i.e.</i>
 that each of the two wars, of Athens against Thebes, and of Thebes
against Phokis, is a war of neighbours against neighbours, or a
conterminous war. Now from the premiss that A is predicable of D, along
with the premiss that B is predicable of D, you infer that A is
predicable of the class B, or of conterminous wars generally; and hence
you draw the farther inference, that A is also predicable of C, another
particular case under the same class B. The inference here is, in the
first instance, from part to whole; and finally, through that whole,
from the one part to another part of the same whole. <i>Induction</i>
includes in its major premiss all the particulars, declaring all of them
 to be severally subjects of the major as predicate; hence it infers as
conclusion, that the major is also predicable of the middle or
class-term comprising all these particulars, but comprising no others. <i>Example</i> includes not all, but only one or a few particulars; inferring from it or them, first, to the entire <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>class, next, to some new analogous particular belonging to the class.<a name="FnAnchor6_58" href="#Footnote6_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a></p>

 Julius Pacius (p. 400) notes the unauthorized character of this
so-called Paradeigmatic Syllogism, contradicting the rules of the
figures laid down by Aristotle, and also the confused manner in which
the scope of it is described: first, to infer from a single example to
the universal; next, to infer from a single example <i>through</i> the
universal to another parallel case. To which we may add the confused
description in p. 69, a. 17, 18, where &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#957; in the first of the two
lines signifies the <i>major</i> extreme — in the second of the two the <i>minor</i> extreme. See Waitz’s note, p. 533.</p>
<p>
If we turn to ch. xxvii. p. 70, a. 30-34, we shall find Aristotle on a
different occasion disallowing altogether this so-called Syllogism from
Example.</p></div>
<p>
These chapters respecting Induction and Example are among the most
obscure and perplexing in the Aristotelian Analytica. The attempt to
throw both Induction and Example into the syllogistic form is alike
complicated and unfortunate; moreover, the unsatisfactory reading and
diversities in the text, among commentators and translators, show that
the reasoning of Aristotle has hitherto been imperfectly apprehended.<a name="FnAnchor6_59" href="#Footnote6_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 From some of his phrases, we see that he was aware of the essential
antithesis between Induction and Syllogism; yet the syllogistic forms
appear to have exercised such fascination over his mind, that he could
not be satisfied without trying to find some abnormal form of Syllogism
to represent and give validity to Induction. In explaining generally
what the Syllogism is, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>what
 Induction is, he informs us that the Syllogism presupposes and rests
upon the process of Induction as its postulate. For there can be no
valid Syllogism without an universal proposition in one (at least) of
the premisses; and he declares, unequivocally, that universal
propositions are obtained only through Induction. How Induction operates
 through the particular facts of sense, remembered, compared, and
coalescing into clusters held together by associating similarity, he has
 also told us; it is thus that Experience, with its universal notions
and conjunctions, is obtained. But this important process is radically
distinct from that of syllogizing, though it furnishes the basis upon
which all syllogizing is built.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote6_59" id="Footnote6_59"></a><a href="#FnAnchor6_59">59</a></span>
 Sir W. Hamilton (Lectures on Logic, vol. i. p. 319) says justly, that
Aristotle has been very brief and unexplicit in his treatment of
Induction. Yet the objections that Hamilton makes to Aristotle are very
different from those which I should make. In the learned and valuable
Appendix to his Lectures (vol. iv. pp. 358-369), he collects various
interesting criticisms of logicians respecting Induction as handled by
Aristotle. Ramus (in his Scholæ Dialecticæ, VIII. xi.) says very truly:—
 “Quid vero sit Inductio, perobscure ab Aristotele declaratur; nec ab
interpretibus intelligitur, quo modo <i>syllogismus</i> per medium concludat majus extremum de minore; <i>inductio</i>, majus de medio per minus.”</p>
<p>
The Inductive Syllogism, as constructed by Aristotle, requires a
reciprocating minor premiss. It may, indeed, be cited (as I have already
 remarked) in support of Hamilton’s favourite precept of quantifying the
 predicate. The predicate of this minor must be assumed as <i>quantified in thought</i>, the subject being taken as co-extensive therewith. Therefore Hamilton’s demand that it shall be <i>quantified in speech</i>
 has really in this case that foundation which he erroneously claims for
 it in all cases. He complains that Lambert and some other logicians
dispense with the necessity of quantifying the predicate of the minor by
 making it disjunctive; and adds the remarkable statement that “the
recent German logicians, Herbart, Twesten, Drobisch, &amp;c., following
Lambert, make the Inductive Syllogism a byeword” (p. 366). I agree with
them in thinking the attempted transformation of Induction into
Syllogism very unfortunate, though my reasons are probably not the same
as theirs. </p>
<p>
Trendelenburg agrees with those who said that Aristotle’s doctrine about
 the Inductive Syllogism required that the minor should be disjunctively
 enunciated (Logische Untersuchungen, xiv. p. 175, xvi. pp. 262, 263;
also Erläuterungen zu den Elementen der Aristotelischen Logik, ss.
34-36, p. 71). Ueberweg takes a similar view (System der <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Lokik'">Logik</span>,
 sect. 128, p. 367, 3rd ed.). If the Inductive Inference is to be
twisted into Syllogism, it seems more naturally to fall into an <i>hypothetical</i> syllogism, <i>e. g.</i>:— </p>
<blockquote>
If this, that, and the other magnet attract iron, all magnets attract iron; <br>
But this, that, and the other magnet do attract iron: <i>Ergo</i>, &amp;c.</blockquote></div>
<p>
The central idea of the Syllogism, as defined by Aristotle, is that of a conclusion following from given premisses by <i>necessary</i> sequence;<a name="FnAnchor6_60" href="#Footnote6_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> meaning by the term <i>necessary</i>
 thus much and no more — that you cannot grant the premisses, and deny
the conclusion, without being inconsistent with yourself, or falling
into contradiction. In all the various combinations of propositions, set
 forth by Aristotle as the different figures and modes of Syllogism,
this property of necessary sequence is found. But it is a property which
 no Induction can ever possess.<a name="FnAnchor6_61" href="#Footnote6_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
 When Aristotle professes to point out a particular mode of Syllogism to
 which Induction conforms, he can only do so by falsifying the process
of Induction, and by not accurately distinguishing between what is
observed and what is inferred. In the case which he takes to illustrate
the Inductive Syllogism — the inference from all particular bile-less
animals to the whole class bile-less — he assumes that we have
ascertained the attribute to belong to <i>all</i> the particulars, and
that the inductive inference consists in passing from all of them to the
 class-term; the passage from premisses to conclusion being here
necessary, and thus falling under the definition of Syllogism; since, to
 grant the premisses, and yet to deny the conclusion, involves a
contradiction. But this doctrine misconceives what the inductive
inference really is. We never can observe <i>all</i> the particulars of a
 class, which is indefinite as to number of particulars, and definite
only in respect of the attributes connoted by the class-term. We can
only observe <i>some</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>of the particulars, a greater or smaller proportion. Now it is in the transition from these <i>to</i> the totality of particulars, that the real inductive inference consists; not in the transition <i>from</i>
 the totality to the class-term which denotes that totality and connotes
 its determining common attribute. In fact, the distinction between the
totality of particulars and the meaning of the class-term, is one not
commonly attended to; though it is worthy of note in an analysis of the
intellectual process, and is therefore brought to view by Aristotle. But
 he employs it incorrectly as an intermediate step to slur over the
radical distinction between Induction and Syllogism. He subjoins:<a name="FnAnchor6_62" href="#Footnote6_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>&mdash; “You must conceive the minor term C (in the Inductive Syllogism) as
composed of all the particulars; for Induction is through all of them.”
You may say that Induction is <i>through</i> all the particulars, if you distinguish this totality from the class-term, and if you treat the class-term as the ultimate <i>terminus ad quem</i>. But the Induction must first travel <i>to</i>
 all the particulars; being forced to take start from a part only, and
then to jump onward far enough to cover the indefinite unobserved
remainder. This jump is the real Induction; and this can never be
brought under the definition of Syllogism; for in the best and most
certain Induction the sequence is never a necessary one: you may grant
the premisses and deny the conclusion without contradicting yourself.</p>

 Alexander intimates that Aristotle enunciated “necessary sequence” as a
 part of his definition of Syllogism, for the express purpose of
distinguishing it from Induction, which is a sequence <i>not necessary</i> (Schol. ad Top. p. 253, a. 19, Br.): &#964;&#8056; &#948;’ <span class="gesp">&#7952;&#958; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;&#962;</span>

<p>
Aristotle states very clearly:— “We believe everything either through Syllogism, or from Induction.”<a name="FnAnchor6_63" href="#Footnote6_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
 Here, as well as in several other passages, he notes the two processes
as essentially distinct. The Syllogism requires in its premisses at
least one general proposition; nor does Aristotle conceive the
“generalities as the original data:”<a name="FnAnchor6_64" href="#Footnote6_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
 he derives them from antecedent Induction. The two processes are (as he
 says) opposite in a certain way; that is, they are complementary halves
 of the same whole; Induction being the establishment of those
universals which are essential for the deductive march of the Syllogism;
 while the two together make up the entire process of scientific
reasoning. But he forgets or relinquishes this antithesis, when he
presents to us the Inductive process as a given variety of Syllogism.
And the objection to such a doctrine becomes the more manifest, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>since
 in constructing his Inductive Syllogism, he is compelled to admit
either that there is no middle term, or that the middle term is subject
of the conclusion, in violation of the syllogistic canons.<a name="FnAnchor6_65" href="#Footnote6_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a></p>

 Aldrich (Artis Log. Rudim. ch. iii. 9, 2, p. 175) and Archbishop
Whately (Elem. of Logic, ch. i. p. 209) agree in treating the argument
of Induction as a defective or informal Syllogism: see also to the same
purpose Sir<span class="correction" title="amended from '.'"> </span>W. Hamilton, Lectures on Logic, vol. i. p. 322. Aldrich treats it as a Syllogism in <i>Barbara</i>,
 with the minor suppressed; but Whately rejects this, because the minor
necessary to be supplied is false. He maintains that the premiss
suppressed is the major, not the minor. I dissent from both. It appears
to me that the opinion which Whately pronounces to be a fallacy is the
real truth: “Induction is a distinct kind of argument from the
Syllogism” (p. 208). It is the essential property of the Syllogism, as
defined by Aristotle and by every one after him, that the truth of the
conclusion follows <i>necessarily</i> from the truth of its premisses:
that you cannot admit the premisses and reject the conclusion without
contradicting yourself. Now this is what the best Induction never
attains; and I contend that the presence or absence of this important
characteristic is quite enough to constitute “two <i>distinct kinds</i> of argument.” Whately objects to Aldrich (whom Hamilton defends) for supplying a suppressed <i>minor</i>, because it is “manifestly false” (p. 209). I object to Whately’s supplied <i>major</i>,
 because it is uncertified, and therefore cannot be used to prove any
conclusion. By clothing arguments from Induction in syllogistic form, we
 invest them with a character of necessity which does not really belong
to them. The establishment of general propositions, and the
interpretation of them when established (to use the phraseology of Mr.
Mill), must always be distinct mental processes; and the forms
appropriate to the latter, involving necessary sequence, ought not to be
 employed to disguise the want of necessity — the varying and graduated
probability, inherent in the former. Mr. Mill says (Syst. Log. Bk. III.
ch. iii. s. 1, p. 343, 5th ed.:) — “As Whately remarks, every induction
is a syllogism with the major premiss suppressed; or (as I prefer
expressing it) every induction may be thrown into the form of a
syllogism, by supplying a major premiss.” Even in this modified
phraseology, I cannot admit the propriety of throwing Induction into
syllogistic forms of argument. By doing this we efface the special
character of Induction, as the jump from particular cases, more or
fewer, to an universal proposition comprising them and an indefinite
number of others besides. To state this in forms which imply that it is a
 necessary step, involving nothing more than the interpretation of a
higher universal proposition, appears to me unphilosophical. Mr. Mill
says with truth (in his admirable chapter explaining the real function
of the major premiss in a Syllogism, p. 211), that the individual cases
are all the evidence which we possess; the step from them to universal
propositions ought not to be expressed in forms which suppose universal
propositions to be already attained.</p>
<p>
I will here add that, though Aldrich himself (as I stated at the
beginning of this note) treats the argument from Induction as a
defective or informal Syllogism, his anonymous Oxonian editor and
commentator takes a sounder view. He says (pp. 176, 177, 184, ed. 1823.
Oxon.):— </p>
<p>
“The principles acquired by human powers may be considered as twofold. Some are <i>intuitive</i>,
 and are commonly called Axioms; the other class of general principles
are those acquired by Induction. But it may be doubted whether this
distinction is correct. It is highly probable, if not certain, that
those primary Axioms generally esteemed <i>intuitive</i>, are in fact
acquired by an inductive process; although that process is less
discernible, because it takes place long before we think of tracing the
actings of our own minds. It is often found necessary to facilitate the
understanding of those Axioms, when they are first proposed to the
judgment, by illustrations drawn from individual cases. But whether it
is, as is generally supposed, the mere <i>enunciation</i> of the principle, or the <i>principle itself</i>,
 which requires the illustration, may admit of a doubt. It seems
probable, however that, such illustrations are nothing more than a
recurrence to the original method by which the knowledge of those
principles was acquired. Thus, the repeated trial or observation of the
necessary connection between mathematical coincidence and equality,
first authorizes the general position or Axiom relative to that subject.
 If this conjecture is founded in fact, it follows that both <i>primary</i> and <i>ultimate</i>
 principles have the same nature and are alike acquired by the exercise
of the inductive faculty.” “Those who acquiesce in the preceding
observations will feel a regret to find <i>Induction</i> classed among
defective or informal Syllogisms. It is in fact prior in its order to
Syllogism; nor can syllogistic reasoning he carried on to any extent
without previous Induction” (p. 184).</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>We must presume Syllogisms without a middle term, when we read:— “The Syllogism through a middle term is <i>by nature</i> prior, and of greater cognitive efficacy; but <i>to us</i> the Syllogism through Induction is plainer and clearer.”<a name="FnAnchor6_66" href="#Footnote6_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
 Nor, indeed, is the saying, when literally taken, at all well-founded;
for the pretended Syllogisms from Induction and Example, far from being
clear and plain, are more involved and difficult to follow than <i>Barbara</i> and <i>Celarent</i>.
 Yet the substance of Aristotle’s thought is true and important, when
considered as declaring the antithesis (not between varieties of
Syllogisms, but) between Induction and Example on the one part, and
Syllogism (Deduction) on the other. It is thus that he sets out the same
 antithesis elsewhere, both in the Analytica Posteriora and the Topica.<a name="FnAnchor6_67" href="#Footnote6_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Prior and more cognizable <i>by nature</i> or <i>absolutely</i>, prior and more cognizable <i>to us</i> or <i>in relation to us</i> — these two are not merely distinct, but the one is the correlate and antithesis of the other. </p>

<p>
<i>To us</i> the particulars of sense stand first, and are the earliest objects of knowledge. <i>To us</i>,
 means to the large variety of individual minds, which grow up
imperceptibly from the simple capacities of infancy to the mature
accomplishments of adult years; each acquiring its own stock of sensible
 impressions, remembered, compared, associated; and each learning a
language, which both embodies in general terms and propositions the
received classification of objects, and communicates the current
emotional beliefs. We all begin by being learners; and we ascend by
different paths to those universal notions and beliefs which constitute
the common fund of the advanced intellect; developed in some minds into <i>principia</i> of philosophy with their consequences. <i>By nature</i>, or <i>absolutely</i>, these <i>principia</i>
 are considered as prior, and as forming the point of departure: the
advanced position is regarded as gained, and the march taken is not that
 of the novice, but that of the trained adult, who having already learnt
 much, is doubly equipped either for learning more or for teaching
others; who thus stands on a summit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>from
 whence he surveys nature as a classified and coherent whole,
manifesting herself in details which he can interpret and sometimes
predict. The path of knowledge, seen <i>relatively to us</i>, is one
through particulars, by way of example to fresh particulars, or by way
of induction to universals. The path of knowledge, <i>by nature</i> or <i>absolutely</i>, is from universals by way of deduction either to new universals or to new particulars. By the cognitive <i>nature</i> of man, Aristotle means the full equipment, of and for cognition, which our mature age exhibits; <i>notiora naturâ</i>
 are the acquisitions, points of view, and processes, familiar in
greater or less perfection to such mature individuals and societies. <i>Notiora nobis</i>
 are the facts and processes with which all of us begin, and which
belong to the intellect in its highest as well as its lowest stage;
though, in the higher stages, they are employed, directed, and modified,
 by an acquired intellectual capital, and by the permanent machinery of
universal significant terms in which that capital is invested.</p>
<p>
Such is the antithesis between <i>notiora naturâ</i> (or <i>simpliciter</i>) and <i>notiora nobis</i> (or <i>quoad nos</i>),
 which Aristotle recognizes as a capital point in his philosophy, and
insists upon in many of his writings. The antithesis is represented by
Example and Induction, in the point of view — <i>quoad nos</i> — last mentioned; by Syllogism or Deduction, in the other point of view — <i>naturâ</i>. Induction (he says),<a name="FnAnchor6_68" href="#Footnote6_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
 or the rising from particulars to universals, is plainer, more
persuasive, more within the cognizance of sensible perception, more
within the apprehension of mankind generally, than Syllogism; but
Syllogism is more cogent and of greater efficacy against controversial
opponents. What he affirms here about Induction is equally true about
the inference from Example, that is, the inference from one or some
particulars, to other analogous particulars; the rudimentary
intellectual process, common to all human and to many animal minds, of
which Induction is an improvement and an exaltation. While Induction
will be more impressive, and will carry assent more easily with an
ordinary uncultivated mind, an acute disputant may always deny the
ultimate inference, for the denial <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>involves no contradiction. But the rightly constructed Syllogism constrains assent;<a name="FnAnchor6_69" href="#Footnote6_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
 the disputant cannot grant the premisses and deny the conclusion
without contradicting himself. The constraining force, however, does not
 come into accurate and regulated working until the principles and
conditions of deductive reasoning have been set forth — until the
Syllogism has been analysed, and the characteristics of its validity, as
 distinguished from its invalidity, have been marked out. This is what
Aristotle teaches in the Analytica and Topica. It admits of being set
out in regular figure and mode — forms of premisses with the conclusion
appropriate to each; and the lesson must be learnt before we can know
how far the force of deductive reasoning, which begins with the <i>notiora naturâ</i>, is legitimately binding and trustworthy.</p>

<p>
Both the two main points of Aristotle’s doctrine — the antithesis
between Induction and Deduction, and the dependence of the latter
process upon premisses furnished by the former, so that the two together
 form the two halves of complete ratiocination and authoritative proof —
 both these two are confused and darkened by his attempt to present the
Inductive inference and the Analogical or Paradeigmatic inference as two
 special forms of Syllogistic deduction.<a name="FnAnchor6_70" href="#Footnote6_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a>
 But when we put aside this attempt, and adhere to Aristotle’s main
doctrine — of Induction as a process antithetical to and separate from
Deduction, yet as an essential preliminary thereto, — we see that it
forms the basis of that complete and comprehensive System of Logic,
recently elaborated in the work of Mr. John Stuart Mill. The inference
from Example (<i>i.e.</i> from some particulars to other similar
particulars) is distinguished by Aristotle from Induction, and is
recognized by him as the primitive intellectual energy, common to all
men, through which Induction is reached; its results he calls Experience
 (&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#943;&#945;), and he describes it as the real guide, more essential than
philosophical generalities, to exactness of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>performance in detail.<a name="FnAnchor6_71" href="#Footnote6_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
 Mr. John Mill has been the first to assign to Experience, thus
understood, its full value and true position in the theory of
Ratiocination; and to show that the Paradeigmatic process exhibits the
prime and ultimate reality of all Inference, the real premisses and the
real conclusion which Inference connects together. Between these two is
interposed the double process of which Induction forms the first half
and Deduction the second; neither the one nor the other being
indispensable to Inference, but both of them being required as
securities for Scientific inference, if we desire to have its
correctness tested and its sufficiency certified; the real evidence,
whereby the conclusion of a Syllogism is proved, being the minor
premiss, together with (not the major premiss itself, but) the
assemblage of particular facts from which by Induction the major premiss
 is drawn. Now Aristotle had present to his mind the conception of
Inference as an entire process, enabling us from some particular truths
to discover and prove other particular truths: he considers it as an
unscientific process, of which to a limited extent other animals besides
 man are capable, and which, as operative under the title of Experience
in mature practical men, is a safer guide than Science amidst the doubts
 and difficulties of action. Upon this foundation he erects the
superstructure of Science; the universal propositions acquired through
Induction, and applied again to particulars or to lower generalities,
through the rules of the deductive Syllogism. He signalizes, with just
emphasis, the universalizing point of view called Science or Theory; but
 he regards it as emerging from particular facts, and as travelling
again downwards towards particular facts. The misfortune is, that he
contents himself with barely recognizing, though he distinctly proclaims
 the necessity of, the inductive part of this complex operation; while
he bestows elaborate care upon the analysis of the deductive part, and
of the rules for conducting it. From this disproportionate treatment,
one half of Logic is made to look like the whole; Science is disjoined
from Experience, and is presented as consisting in Deduction alone;
every thing which is not Deduction, is degraded into unscientific
Experience; the major premiss of the Syllogism being considered as part
of the proof of the conclusion, and the conclusion being necessarily
connected <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>therewith, we appear to have acquired a <i>locus standi</i>
 and a binding cogency such as Experience could never supply; lastly,
when Aristotle resolves Induction into a peculiar variety of the
Syllogism, he appears finally to abolish all its separate dignity and
jurisdiction. This one-sided view of Logic has been embraced and
perpetuated by the Aristotelian expositors, who have carefully
illustrated, and to a certain extent even amplified, the part which was
already in comparative excess, while they have added nothing to the part
 that was in defect, and have scarcely even preserved Aristotle’s
recognition of it as being not merely legitimate but essential. The vast
 body of Inductive Science, accumulated during the last three centuries,
 has thus, until recently, been allowed to grow up, as if its proofs and
 processes had nothing to do with Logic.</p>

 Heyder (in his learned treatise, Darstellung der Aristotelischen und
Hegelschen Dialektik, p. 226), after having considered the
unsatisfactory process whereby Aristotle attempts to resolve Induction
into a variety of Syllogism, concludes by a remark which I think just:—
“Aus alle dem erhellt zur Genüge, dass sich Aristoteles bei dem Versuch
die Induction auf eine Schlussform zurückzuführen, selbst sich nicht
recht befriedigt fühlte, und derselbe wohl nur aus seinem durchgängigen
Bestreben zu erklären ist, alles wissenschaftliche Verfahren in die Form
 des Schlusses zu bringen; dass dagegen, seiner eigentlichen Meinung und
 der strengen Consequenz seiner Lehre zu Folge, die Induction zum
syllogistischen und beweisenden Verfahren einen in dem Begriff der
beiden Verfahrungsweisen liegenden Gegensatz bildete, was sich ihm dann
auch auf das Verhältniss der Induction zur Begriffsbestimmung ausdehnen
musste.”</p></div>

<p>
But though this restricted conception of Logic or the theory of
Reasoning has arisen naturally from Aristotle’s treatment, I maintain
that it does not adequately represent his view of that theory. In his
numerous treatises on other subjects, scarcely any allusion is made to
the Syllogism; nor is appeal made to the rules for it laid down in the
Analytica. His conviction that the formalities of Deduction were only
one part of the process of general reasoning, and that the value of the
final conclusion depended not merely upon their being correctly
performed, but also upon the correctness of that initial part whereby
they are supplied with matter for premisses — is manifested as well by
his industry (unrivalled among his contemporaries) in collecting
multifarious facts, as by his specific declarations respecting
Induction. Indeed, a recent most erudite logician, Sir William Hamilton,
 who insists upon the construction of Logic in its strictest sense as
purely formal, blames Aristotle<a name="FnAnchor6_72" href="#Footnote6_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
 for having transgressed this boundary, and for introducing other
considerations bearing on diversities of matter and of material
evidence. The charge so made, to whatever extent it is well-founded,
does rather partake of the nature of praise; inasmuch as it evinces
Aristotle’s larger views of the theory of Inference, and confirms his
own statement that the Deductive process was only the last half of it,
presupposing a prior Induction. It is only this last half that Aristotle
 has here analysed, setting forth its formal conditions with precepts
founded thereupon; while he claims to have accomplished the work by long
 and patient investigation, having found not the smallest foundation
laid by others, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>bespeaks indulgence<a name="FnAnchor6_73" href="#Footnote6_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
 as for a first attempt requiring to be brought to completion by others.
 He made this first step for himself; and if any one would make a second
 step, so as to apply the same analysis to the other half, and to bring
out in like manner the formal conditions and principles of Induction, we
 may fairly believe that Aristotle would have welcomed the act, as
filling up what he himself recognized to be a gap in the entire compass
of Reasoning. As to his own achievement, it is certain that he could not
 have composed the Analytica and Topica, if he had not had before him
many specimens of the deductive process to study and compare. Neither
could the inductive process have been analysed, until after the examples
 of successful advance in inductive science which recent years have
furnished. Upon these examples, mainly, has been based the profound
System of Mr. John Stuart Mill, analysing and discriminating the
formalities of Induction in the same way as those of Deduction had
before been handled by Aristotle; also fusing the two together as
co-operative towards one comprehensive scheme of Logic — the Logic of
Evidence generally, or of Truth as discoverable and proveable. In this
scheme the Syllogistic Theory, or Logic of Consistency between one
proposition and others, is recognized as an essential part, but is no
longer tolerated as an independent whole.<a name="FnAnchor6_74" href="#Footnote6_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a></p>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote6_74" id="Footnote6_74"></a><a href="#FnAnchor6_74">74</a></span> Mr. John Stuart Mill says (Bk.

 Again in another passage: “We have found that all Inference,
consequently all Proof, and all discovery of truths not self-evident,
consists of inductions, and the interpretation of inductions; that all
our knowledge, not intuitive, comes to us exclusively from that source.
What Induction is, therefore, and what conditions render it legitimate,
cannot but be deemed the main question of logic — the question which
includes all others. It is however one which professed writers on logic
have almost entirely passed over. The generalities of the subject,
indeed, have not been altogether neglected by metaphysicians; but, for
want of sufficient acquaintance with the processes by which science has
actually succeeded in establishing general truths, their analysis of the
 inductive operation, even when unexceptionable as to correctness, has
not been specific enough to be made the foundation of practical rules,
which might be for Induction itself what the rules of the Syllogism are
for interpretation of Induction” (Bk. III. ch. i. s. 1. p. 313.) — “The
business of Inductive Logic is to provide rules and models (such as the
Syllogism and its rules are for ratiocination) to which if inductive
arguments conform, those arguments are conclusive, and not otherwise.
This is what the Four Methods profess to be, and what I believe they are
 universally considered to be by experimental philosophers, who had
practised all of them long before any one sought to reduce the practice
to theory” (Bk. III. ch. ix. s. 5, p. 471, 5th ed.) — See also the same
point of view more copiously set forth, in Mr. Mill’s later work,
‘Examination of Sir W. Hamilton’s Philosophy’ (ch. xx. pp. 454-462, 3rd
ed.): “It is only as a means to material truth that the formal (or to
speak more clearly, the conditional) validity of an operation of thought
 is of any value; and even that value is only negative: we have not made
 the smallest positive advance towards right thinking, by merely keeping
 ourselves consistent in what is perhaps systematic error. This by no
means implies that Formal Logic, even in its narrowest sense, is not of
very great, though purely negative value.” — “Not only however is it
indispensable that the larger Logic, which embraces all the general
conditions of the ascertainment of truth, should be studied in addition
to the smaller Logic, which only concerns itself with the conditions of
consistency; but the smaller Logic ought to be (at least, finally)
studied as part of the greater — as a portion of the means to the same
end; and its relation to the other parts — to the other means — should
be distinctly displayed.”</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>After adverting to another variety of ratiocinative procedure, which he calls <i>Apagoge</i>
 or Abduction (where the minor is hardly more evident than the
conclusion, and might sometimes conveniently become a conclusion first
to be proved),<a name="FnAnchor6_75" href="#Footnote6_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> Aristotle goes on to treat of Objection generally — the function of the dialectical respondent. The <i>Enstasis</i>
 or Objection is a proposition opposed not to a conclusion, but to the
proposition set up by the defendant. When the proposition set up by him
is universal, as it must be if he seeks to establish an universal
conclusion, your objection may be either universal or particular: you
may deny either the whole of his proposition, or only one portion of the
 particulars contained under it; the denial of one single particular,
when substantiated, being enough to overthrow his universal.
Accordingly, your objection, being thus variously opposed to the
proposition, will lie in the syllogistic figures which admit opposite
conclusions; that is, either in the First or Third; for the Second
figure admits only negative conclusions not opposed to each other. If
the defendant has set up an Universal Affirmative, you may deny the
whole and establish a contrary negative, in the First figure; or you may
 deny a part only, and establish a contradictory negative, in the Third
figure. The like, if he has set up an Universal Negative: you may impugn
 it either by an universal contrary affirmative, in the First figure; or
 by a particular contradictory affirmative, in the Third figure.<a name="FnAnchor6_76" href="#Footnote6_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a></p>

<p>
In objecting to A <i>universally</i>, you take a term comprehending the original subject; in objecting <i>particularly</i>,
 a term comprehended by it. Of the new term in each case you deny the
original predicate, and have thus, as a major premiss, E. For a minor
premiss, you affirm, in the first case, the new term as predicate of the
 original subject (less comprehensive); in the second case, the original
 subject (more comprehensive) as predicate of the new term. This gives
you, in the first case, a conclusion in <i>Celarent</i> (Fig. I.), and, in the second, a conclusion in <i>Felapton</i>
 (Fig. III.); opposed, the one universally or contrarily, the other
particularly or contradictorily, to the original proposition.</p></div>
<p>
The Enthymeme is a syllogism from Probabilities or Signs;<a name="FnAnchor6_77" href="#Footnote6_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> the two being not exactly the same. <i>Probabilities</i>
 are propositions commonly accepted, and true in the greater number of
cases; such as, Envious men hate those whom they envy, Persons who are
beloved look with affection on those who love <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>them. We call it a <i>Sign</i>,
 when one fact is the antecedent or consequent of another, and therefore
 serves as mark or evidence thereof. The conjunction may be either
constant, or frequent, or merely occasional: if constant, we obtain for
the major premiss of our syllogism a proposition approaching that which
is universally or necessarily true; if not constant but only frequent or
 occasional, the major premiss of our syllogism will at best only be
probable. The constant conjunction will furnish us with a Syllogism or
Enthymeme in the First figure; the significant mark being here a genuine
 middle term — subject in the major premiss, and predicate in the minor.
 We can then get a conclusion both affirmative and universally true. In
other cases, we cannot obtain premisses for a syllogism in the First
figure, but only for a syllogism in the Second or Third. In the Third
figure, since we get by right no universal conclusions at all, but only
particular conclusions, the conclusion of the Enthymeme, though it may
happen to be true, is open to refutation. Where by the laws of Syllogism
 no affirmative conclusion whatever is possible, as in the Second
figure, the conclusion obtained by Enthymeme is altogether suspicious.
In contrast with the Sign in these figures, that which enters as an
effective middle term into the First figure, should be distinguished
under the name of <i>Proof</i> (&#964;&#949;&#954;&#956;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;.)<a name="FnAnchor6_78" href="#Footnote6_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a></p>

<p>
Aristotle throws in the remark (a. 24), that, when one premiss only of
the Enthymeme is enunciated, it is a Sign; when the other is added, it
becomes a Syllogism. In the examples given to illustrate the description
 of the Enthymeme, that which belongs to the First figure has its three
terms and two propositions specified like a complete and regular
Syllogism; but when we come to the Third and Second figures, Aristotle
gives two alternate ways of stating each: one way in full, with both
premisses enunciated, constituting a normal, though invalid, Syllogism;
the other way, with only one of the premisses enunciated, the other
being suppressed as well-known and familiar.</p>
<p>
Among logicians posterior to Aristotle, the definition given of the
Enthymeme, and supposed to be derived from Aristotle was, that it was a
Syllogism with one of the premisses suppressed — &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#942;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;. Sir W.
Hamilton has impugned this doctrine, and has declared the definition to
be both absurd in itself, and not countenanced by Aristotle. (Lectures
on Logic, Vol. I. Lect. xx. p. 386, seq.) I think Hamilton is mistaken
on this point. (See Mr. Cope’s Introd. to Arist. Rhetoric, p. 103, seq.)
 Even in the present chapter Aristotle distinctly alludes to the
monolemmatic enunciation of the Enthymeme as one mode of distinguishing
it from a full Syllogism; and in the Rhetorica he brings out this
characteristic still more forcibly. The distinction is one which belongs
 to Rhetoric more than to Logic; the rhetor, in enunciating his
premisses, must be careful not to weary his auditors; he must glance at
or omit reasons that are familiar to them; logical fulness and accuracy
would be inconsistent with his purpose. The writers subsequent to
Aristotle, who think much of the rhetorical and little of the logical
point of view, bring out the distinction yet more forcibly. But the
rhetorical mode of stating premisses is often not so much an omission
either of major or minor, as a confused blending or packing up of both
into one.</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle concludes his Analytica Priora by applying this doctrine of Signs to determine the limits within which Physiognomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
 as a science is practicable. The basis upon which it rests is this
general fact or postulate: That in all natural affections of the animal,
 bodily changes and mental changes accompany each other. The former,
therefore, may become signs or proofs of the latter,<a name="FnAnchor6_79" href="#Footnote6_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>
 if, in each class of animals, we can discriminate the one specific
bodily phenomenon which attaches to each mental phenomenon. Thus, the
lion is a courageous animal. What is the bodily sign accompanying a
courageous disposition? It is (we assume here) the having extremities of
 great size. This belongs to all lions, as a <i>proprium</i>; in the
sense that, though it may or does belong also to some individuals of
other races (as men), it does not belong to any other entire race.
Physiognomy as a science will, then, be possible, if we can find races
of animals which have only one characteristic mental attribute, and if
we can discover what is the physical attribute correlating with it.<a name="FnAnchor6_80" href="#Footnote6_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> But the difficulties are greater when the same race has two characteristic mental attributes (<i>e.g.</i>
 lions are both courageous and generous), each with its correlative
physical attribute; for how can we tell which belongs to which? We have
then to study individuals of other races possessing one of these
attributes without the other; thus, if we find that courageous men, who
are not generous, agree in having large extremities, we may infer that
this last circumstance is, in the lion, the correlative mark of his
courage and not of his generosity. The physiognomonic inference will be
expressed by a syllogism in the First figure, in which the major term
(A) reciprocates and is convertible with the middle term (B), while B
stretches beyond (or is more extensive than) the minor (C); this
relation of the terms being necessary, if there is to be a single mark
for a particular attribute.<a name="FnAnchor6_81" href="#Footnote6_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a></p>

<p>
Here the treatise ends; but the reader will remember that, in describing
 the canons laid down by Aristotle for the Syllogism with its three
Figures and the Modes contained therein, I confined myself to the simple
 Assertory syllogism, postponing for the moment the long expositions
added by him about Modal syllogisms, involving the Possible and the
Necessary. What is proper to be said about this complicated and useless
portion of the Analytica Priora, may well come in here; for, in truth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>the
 doctrines just laid down about Probabilities, Signs, and Proofs, bring
us back to the Modals under a different set of phrases. The Possible or
Problematical is that, of the occurrence or reality of which we doubt,
neither believing nor disbelieving it, not being prepared to assert
either that it is, or that it is not; <i>that which may be or may not be</i>.
 It is our manner of speaking, when we have only signs or probabilities
to guide us, and not certain proofs. The feeling of doubt is, as a
psychological phenomenon, essentially distinct from the feeling of
belief which, in its objective aspect, correlates with certainty or
matter of fact; as well as from the feeling of disbelief, the correlate
of which can only be described negatively. Every man knows these
feelings by his own mental experience. But in describing the feeling of
doubt, as to its matter or in its objective aspect, we must take care to
 use phrases which declare plainly both sides of its disjunctive or
alternative character. The Possible is, <i>That which either may be or may not be</i>. As <i>That which may be</i>, it stands opposed to the Impossible; as <i>That which may not be</i>,
 it stands opposed to the Necessary. It thus carries with it negation
both of impossibility and of necessity; but, in common parlance, the
first half of this meaning stands out prominently, and is mistaken for
the whole. Aristotle, as we saw previously, speaks equivocally on this
point, recognizing a double signification of the term: he sometimes uses
 it in the sense opposed only to impossible, maintaining that what is
necessary must also be possible; sometimes in the truer sense, opposed
both to necessity and to impossibility.<a name="FnAnchor6_82" href="#Footnote6_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote6_82" id="Footnote6_82"></a><a href="#FnAnchor6_82">82</a></span> Aristot. De Interpret. xiii. p. 22. Analyt. Prior. I. xiii. p. 32, a. 21, 29, 36, xiv. p. 33, b. 22; xix. p. 38, a. 35.</p></div>
<p>
The Possible or Problematical, however, in this latter complete sense — <i>What may or may not be</i>
 — exhibits various modifications or gradations. 1. The chances on
either side may be conceived as perfectly equal, so that there is no
probability, and we have no more reason for expecting one side of the
alternative than the other; the sequence or conjunction is
indeterminate. Aristotle construes this indeterminateness in many cases
(not as <i>subjective</i>, or as depending upon our want of complete knowledge and calculating power, but) as <i>objective</i>,
 insuperable, and inherent in many phenomenal agencies; characterizing
it, under the names of Spontaneity and Chance, as the essentially
unpredictable. 2. The chances on both sides may be conceived as unequal
and the ratio between them as varying infinitely: the usual and ordinary
 tendency of phenomena — what Aristotle calls <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>Nature
 — prevails in the majority of cases, but not in all; being liable to
occasional counteraction from Chance and other forces. Thus, between
Necessity and perfect constancy at one extreme (such as the rotation of
the sidereal sphere), and Chance at the other, there may be every shade
of gradation; from natural agency next below the constant, down to the
lowest degree of probability.<a name="FnAnchor6_83" href="#Footnote6_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a></p>

<p>
Now, within the range of these limits lie what Aristotle describes as
Signs and Probabilities; in fact, all the marks which we shall presently
 come to as distinguishing the <i>dialectical</i> syllogism from the <i>demonstrative</i>.
 But here is involved rather the matter of the Syllogism than its form.
The form indeed is so far implicated, that (as Aristotle justly remarks
at the end of the Analytica Priora<a name="FnAnchor6_84" href="#Footnote6_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>),
 the First figure is the only one that will prove both conjunctions and
disjunctions, as well constant as occasional; the Third figure proves
only occasional conjunctions and occasional disjunctions, not constant;
the Second figure will prove no conjunctions at all, but only
disjunctions, constant as well as occasional. Here a difference of form
is properly pointed out as coupled with and founded on a difference of
matter. But the special rules given by Aristotle, early in the present
treatise, for the conversion of Modal Propositions, and the distinctions
 that he draws as to the modal character of the conclusion according as
one or other of the premisses belongs to one or other of the different
modes, — are both prolix and of little practical value.<a name="FnAnchor6_85" href="#Footnote6_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a></p>

<p>
What he calls the Necessary might indeed, from the point of view now
reached, cease to be recognized as a separate mode at all. The Certain
and the Problematical are real modes of the Proposition; objective
correlates to the subjective phases called Belief and Doubt. But no
proposition can be more than certain: the word <i>necessary</i>, in
strictness, implies only a peculiarity of the evidence on which our
belief is grounded. Granting certain given premisses to be true, a given
 conclusion must be true also, if we would avoid inconsistency and
contradiction.</p>

ANALYTICA POSTERIORA I.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the two books of Analytica Priora, Aristotle has carried us through
the full doctrine of the functions and varieties of the Syllogism; with
an intimation that it might be applied to two purposes — Demonstration
and Dialectic. We are now introduced to these two distinct applications
of the Syllogism: first, in the Analytica Posteriora, to Demonstration;
next, in the Topica, to Dialectic. We are indeed distinctly told that,
as far as the forms and rules of Syllogism go, these are alike
applicable to both;<a name="FnAnchor7_1" href="#Footnote7_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 but the difference of matter and purpose in the two cases is so
considerable as to require a distinct theory and precepts for the one
and for the other.</p>

<p>
The contrast between Dialectic (along with Rhetoric) on the one hand and
 Science on the other is one deeply present to the mind of Aristotle. He
 seems to have proceeded upon the same fundamental antithesis as that
which appears in the Platonic dialogues; but to have modified it both in
 meaning and in terminology, dismissing at the same time various
hypotheses with which Plato had connected it.</p>
<p>
The antithesis that both thinkers have in view is Opinion or Common Sense <i>versus</i>
 Science or Special Teaching and Learning; those aptitudes,
acquirements, sentiments, antipathies, &amp;c., which a man imbibes and
appropriates insensibly, partly by his own doing and suffering, partly
by living amidst the drill and example of a given society — as
distinguished from those accomplishments which he derives from a teacher
 already known to possess them, and in which both the time of his
apprenticeship and the steps of his progress are alike assignable. </p>
<p>
Common Sense is the region of Opinion, in which there is diversity of
authorities and contradiction of arguments without any settled truth;
all affirmations being particular and relative, true at one time and
place, false at another. Science, on the contrary, deals with
imperishable Forms and universal truths, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>which
 Plato regards, in their subjective aspect, as the innate, though
buried, furniture of the soul, inherited from an external pre-existence,
 and revived in it out of the misleading data of sense by a process
first of the cross-examining <i>Elenchus</i>, next of scientific
Demonstration. Plato depreciates altogether the untaught, unexamined,
stock of acquirements which passes under the name of Common Sense, as a
mere worthless semblance of knowledge without reality; as requiring to
be broken up by the scrutinizing <i>Elenchus</i>, in order to impress a
painful but healthy consciousness of ignorance, and to prepare the mind
 for that process of teaching whereby alone Science or Cognition can be
imparted.<a name="FnAnchor7_2" href="#Footnote7_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 He admits that Opinion may be right as well as wrong. Yet even when
right, it is essentially different from Science, and is essentially
transitory; a safe guide to action while it lasts, but not to be trusted
 for stability or permanence.<a name="FnAnchor7_3" href="#Footnote7_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
 By Plato, Rhetoric is treated as belonging to the province of Opinion,
Dialectic to that of Science. The rhetor addresses multitudes in
continuous speech, appeals to received common places, and persuades: the
 dialectician, conversing only with one or a few, receives and imparts
the stimulus of short question and answer; thus awakening the dormant
capacities of the soul to the reminiscence of those universal Forms or
Ideas which are the only true Knowable.</p>

<p>
Like Plato, Aristotle distinguishes the region of Common Sense or
Opinion from that of Science, and regards Universals as the objects of
Science. But his Universals are very different from those of Plato: they
 are not self-existent realities, known by the mind from a long period
of pre-existence, and called up by reminiscence out of the chaos of
sensible impressions. To operate such revival is the great function that
 Plato assigns to Dialectic. But in the philosophy of Aristotle
Dialectic is something very different. It is placed alongside of
Rhetoric in the region of Opinion. Both the rhetor and the dialectician
deal with all subjects, recognizing no limit; they attack or defend any
or all conclusions, employing the process of ratiocination which
Aristotle has treated under the name of Syllogism; they take up as
premisses any one of the various opinions in circulation, for which some
 plausible authority may be cited; they follow out the consequences of
one opinion in its bearing upon others, favourable or unfavourable, and
thus become well furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
 with arguments for and against all. The ultimate foundation here
supposed is some sort of recognized presumption or authoritative
sanction<a name="FnAnchor7_4" href="#Footnote7_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
 — law, custom, or creed, established among this or that portion of
mankind, some maxim enunciated by an eminent poet, some doctrine of the
Pythagoreans or other philosophers, current proverb, answer from the
Delphian oracle, &amp;c. Any one of these may serve as a dialectical
authority. But these authorities, far from being harmonious with each
other, are recognized as independent, discordant, and often
contradictory. Though not all of equal value,<a name="FnAnchor7_5" href="#Footnote7_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 each is sufficient to warrant the setting up of a thesis for debate. In
 Dialectic, one of the disputants undertakes to do this, and to answer
all questions that may be put to him respecting the thesis, without
implicating himself in inconsistencies or contradiction. The questioner
or assailant, on the other hand, shapes his questions with a view to
refute the thesis, by eliciting answers which may furnish him with
premisses for some syllogism in contradiction thereof. But he is tied
down by the laws of debate to syllogize only from such premisses as the
respondent has expressly granted; and to put questions in such manner
that the respondent is required only to give or withhold assent,
according as he thinks right. </p>

We shall see more fully how Aristotle deals with Dialectic, when we come
 to the Topica: here I put it forward briefly, in order that the reader
may better understand, by contrast, its extreme antithesis, viz.,
Demonstrative Science and Necessary Truth as conceived by Aristotle.
First, instead of two debaters, one of whom sets up a thesis which he
professes to understand and undertakes to maintain, while the other puts
 questions upon it, — Demonstrative Science assumes a teacher who knows,
 and a learner conscious of ignorance but wishing to know. The teacher
lays down premisses which the learner is bound to receive; or if they
are put in the form of questions, the learner must answer them as the
teacher expects, not according to his own knowledge. Secondly, instead
of the unbounded miscellany of subjects treated in Dialectic,
Demonstrative Science is confined to a few special subjects, in which
alone appropriate premisses can be obtained, and definitions framed.
Thirdly, instead <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>of the several heterogeneous authorities recognized in Dialectic, Demonstrative Science has <i>principia</i> of its own, serving as points of departure; some <i>principia</i>
 common to all its varieties, others special or confined to one alone.
Fourthly, there is no conflict of authorities in Demonstrative Science;
its propositions are essential, universal, and true <i>per se</i>, from the commencement to the conclusion; while Dialectic takes in accidental premisses as well as essential. Fifthly, the <i>principia</i>
 of Demonstrative Science are obtained from Induction only; originating
in particulars which are all that the ordinary growing mind can at first
 apprehend (<i>notiora nobis</i>), but culminating in universals which correspond to the perfection of our cognitive comprehension (<i>notiora naturâ</i>.)<a name="FnAnchor7_6" href="#Footnote7_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

Amidst all these diversities, Dialectic and Demonstrative Science have
in common the process of Syllogism, including such assumptions as the
rules of syllogizing postulate. In both, the conclusions are
hypothetically true (<i>i.e.</i> granting the premisses to be so). But,
in demonstrative syllogism, the conclusions are true universally,
absolutely, and necessarily; deriving this character from their
premisses, which Aristotle holds up as the cause, reason, or condition
of the conclusion. What he means by Demonstrative Science, we may best
conceive, by taking it as a small &#964;&#941;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; or specially cultivated
enclosure, subdivided into still smaller separate compartments — the
extreme antithesis to the vast common land of Dialectic. Between the two
 lies a large region, neither essentially determinate like the one, nor
essentially indeterminate like the other; an intermediate region in
which are comprehended the subjects of the treatises forming the very
miscellaneous Encyclopædia of Aristotle. These subjects do not admit of
being handled with equal exactness; accordingly, he admonishes us that
it is important to know how much exactness is attainable in each, and
not to aspire to more.<a name="FnAnchor7_7" href="#Footnote7_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

The different degrees of exactness attainable in different departments
of science, and the reasons upon which such difference depends are well
explained in the sixth book of Mr. John Stuart Mill’s System of Logic,
vol. II. chap. iii. pp. 422-425, 5th ed. Aristotle says that there can
be no scientific theory or cognition about &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; which he
defines to be that which belongs to a subject neither necessarily, nor
constantly, nor usually, but only on occasion (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">E.</span> p. 1026, b. 3, 26, 33; <span class="smcap">K.</span>
 p. 1065, a. 1, meaning &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#972;, — Analyt. Post. I.
6, 75, a. 18; for he uses the term in two different senses — Metaph. <span class="smcap">&#916;</span>.
 p. 1025, a. 31). In his view, there can be no science except about
constant conjunctions; and we find the same doctrine in the following
passage of Mr. Mill:— “Any facts are fitted, in themselves, to be a
subject of science, which follow one another according to constant laws;
 although those laws may not have been discovered, nor even be
discoverable by our existing resources. Take, for instance, the most
familiar class of meteorological phenomena, those of rain and sunshine.
Scientific inquiry has not yet succeeded in ascertaining the order of
antecedence and consequence among these phenomena, so as to be able, at
least in our regions of the earth, to predict them with certainty, or
even with any high degree of probability. Yet no one doubts that the
phenomena depend on laws.… Meteorology not only has in itself every
requisite for being, but actually is, a science; though from the
difficulty of observing the facts upon which the phenomena depend (a
difficulty inherent in the peculiar nature of those phenomena), the
science is extremely imperfect; and were it perfect, might probably be
of little avail in practice, since the data requisite for applying its
principles to particular instances would rarely be procurable.</p>
<p>
“A case may be conceived of an intermediate character between the
perfection of science, and this its extreme imperfection. It may happen
that the greater causes, those on which the principal part of the
phenomena depends, are within the reach of observation and measurement;
so that, if no other causes intervened, a complete explanation could be
given, not only of the phenomenon in general, but of all the variations
and modifications which it admits of. But inasmuch as other, perhaps
many other, causes, separately insignificant in their effects,
co-operate or conflict in many or in all cases with those greater
causes, the effect, accordingly, presents more or less of aberration
from what would be produced by the greater causes alone. Now if these
minor causes are not so constantly accessible, or not accessible at all,
 to accurate observation, the principal mass of the effect may still, as
 before, be accounted for, and even predicted; but there will be
variations and modifications which we shall not be competent to explain
thoroughly, and our predictions will not be fulfilled accurately, but
only approximately.</p>
<p>
“It is thus, for example, with the theory of the Tides.… And this is
what is or ought to be meant by those who speak of sciences which are
not exact sciences. Astronomy was once a science, without being an exact
 science. It could not become exact until not only the general course of
 the planetary motions, but the perturbations also, were accounted for
and referred to their causes. It has become an exact science because its
 phenomena have been brought under laws comprehending the whole of the
causes by which the phenomena are influenced, whether in a great or only
 in a trifling degree, whether in all or only in some cases, and
assigning to each of those causes the share of effect that really
belongs to it.… The science of human nature falls far short of the
standard of exactness now realized in Astronomy; but there is no reason
that it should not be as much a science as Tidology is, or as Astronomy
was when its calculations had only mastered the main phenomena, but not
the perturbations.”</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>In
setting out the process of Demonstration, Aristotle begins from the idea
 of teaching and learning. In every variety thereof some <i>præcognita</i>
 must be assumed, which the learner must know before he comes to be
taught, and upon which the teacher must found his instruction.<a name="FnAnchor7_8" href="#Footnote7_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
 This is equally true, whether we proceed (as in Syllogism) from the
more general to the less general, or (as in Induction) from the
particular to the general. He who comes to learn Geometry must know
beforehand the figures called circle and triangle, and must have a
triangular figure drawn to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>contemplate;
 he must know what is a unit or monad, and must have, besides, exposed
before him what is chosen as the unit for the reasoning on which he is
about to enter. These are the <i>præcognita</i> required for Geometry and Arithmetic. Some <i>præcognita</i> are also required preparatory to any and all reasoning: <i>e.g.</i>,
 the maxim of Identity (fixed meaning of terms and propositions), and
the maxims of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle (impossibility that a
 proposition and its contradictory can either be both true or both
false.)<a name="FnAnchor7_9" href="#Footnote7_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 The learner must thus know beforehand certain Definitions and Axioms,
as conditions without which the teacher cannot instruct him in any
demonstrative science.</p>

Aristotle, here at the beginning, seeks to clear up a difficulty which
had been raised in the time of Plato as between knowledge and learning.
How is it possible to <i>learn</i> at all? is a question started in the Menon.<a name="FnAnchor7_10" href="#Footnote7_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 You either know a thing already, and, on this supposition, you do not
want to learn it; or you do not know it, and in this case you cannot
learn it, because, even when you have learnt, you cannot tell whether
the matter learnt is what you were in search of. To this difficulty, the
 reply made in the Menon is, that you never <i>do</i> learn any thing
really new. What you are said to learn, is nothing more than
reminiscence of what had once been known in an anterior life, and
forgotten at birth into the present life; what is supposed to be learnt
is only the recall of that which you once knew, but had forgotten. Such
is the Platonic doctrine of Reminiscence. Aristotle will not accept that
 doctrine as a solution; but he acknowledges the difficulty, and
intimates that others had already tried to solve it without success. His
 own solution is that there are two grades of cognition: (1) the full,
complete, absolute; (2) the partial, incomplete, qualified. What you
already know by the first of these grades, you cannot be said to learn;
but you may learn that which you know only by the second grade, and by
such learning you bring your incomplete cognition up to completeness. </p>

Thus, you have learnt, and you know, the universal truth, that every
triangle has its three angles equal to two right angles; but you do not
yet know that A B C, D E F, G H I, &amp;c., have their two angles equal
to two right angles; for you have not yet seen any of these figures, and
 you do not know that they <i>are</i> triangles. The moment that you see A B C, or hear what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>figure
 it is, you learn at one and the same time two facts: first, that it is a
 triangle; next, by virtue of your previous cognition, that it possesses
 the above-mentioned property. You knew this <i>in a certain way</i> or incompletely before, by having followed the demonstration of the universal truth, and by thus knowing that <i>every</i>
 triangle had its three angles equal to two right angles; but you did
not know it absolutely, being ignorant that A B C was a triangle.<a name="FnAnchor7_11" href="#Footnote7_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

Aristotle reports the solution given by others, but from which he
himself dissented, of the Platonic puzzle. The respondent was asked, Do
you know that every Dyad is even? — Yes. Some Dyad was then produced,
which the respondent did not know to be a Dyad; accordingly he did not
know it to be even. Now the critics alluded to by Aristotle said that
the respondent made a wrong answer; instead of saying I know every Dyad
is even, he ought to have said, Every Dyad <i>which I know to be a Dyad</i>
 is even. Aristotle pronounces that this criticism is incorrect. The
respondent knows the conclusion which had previously been demonstrated
to him; and that conclusion was, Every triangle has its three angles
equal to two right angles; it was not, Every thing <i>which I know</i>

<p>
This discussion, in the commencement of the Analytica Posteriora
(combined with Analyt. Priora, II. xxi.), is interesting, because it
shows that even then the difficulties were felt, about the major
proposition of the Syllogism, which Mr. John Stuart Mill has so ably
cleared up, for the first time, in his System of Logic. See Book II. ch.
 iii. of that work, especially as it stands in the sixth edition, with
the note there added, pp. 232-233. You affirm, in the major proposition
of the Syllogism, that every triangle has its three angles equal to two
right angles; does not this include the triangle A, B, C, and is it not
therefore a <i>petitio principii</i>? Or, if it be not so, does it not
assert more than you know? The Sophists (upon whom both Plato and
Aristotle are always severe, but who were valuable contributors to the
theory of Logic by fastening upon the weak points) attacked it on this
ground, and raised against it the puzzle described by Aristotle (in this
 chapter), afterwards known as the Sophism entitled &#8001; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;
(see Themistius Paraphras. I. i.; also ‘Plato and the Other Companions
of Sokrates,’ Vol. III. ch. xxxviii. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#v1page134">p. 489</a>).
 The critics whom Aristotle here cites and disapproves, virtually
admitted the pertinence of this puzzle by modifying their assertion, and
 by cutting it down to “Everything <i>which we know to be a triangle</i>
 has its three angles equal to two right angles.” Aristotle finds fault
with this modification, which, however, is one way of abating the excess
 of absolute and peremptory pretension contained in the major, and of
intimating the want of a minor to be added for interpreting and
supplementing the major; while Aristotle himself arrives at the same
result by admitting that the knowledge corresponding to the major
proposition is not yet absolute, but incomplete and qualified; and that
it is only made absolute when supplemented by a minor.</p>
<p>
The very same point, substantially, is raised in the discussion between
Mr. John Stuart Mill and an opponent, in the note above referred to. “A
writer in the ‘British Quarterly Review’ endeavours to show that there
is no <i>petitio principii</i> in the Syllogism, by denying that the
proposition All men are mortal, asserts or assumes that Socrates is
mortal. In support of this denial, he argues that we may, and in fact
do, admit the general proposition without having particularly examined
the case of Socrates, and even without knowing whether the individual so
 named is a man or something else. But this of course was never denied.
That we can and do draw inferences concerning cases specifically unknown
 to us, is the datum from which all who discuss this subject must set
out. The question is, in what terms the evidence or ground on which we
draw these conclusions may best be designated — whether it is most
correct to say that the unknown case is proved by known cases, or that
it is proved by a general proposition including both sets of cases, the
known and the unknown? I contend for the former mode of expression. I
hold it an abuse of language to say, that the proof that Socrates is
mortal, is that all men are mortal. Turn it in what way we will, this
seems to me asserting that a thing is the proof of itself. Whoever
pronounces the words, All men are mortal, has affirmed that Socrates is
mortal, though he may never have heard of Socrates; for since Socrates,
whether known to be a man or not, really is a man, he is included in the
 words, All men, and in every assertion of which they are the subject.…
The reviewer acknowledges that the maxim (Dictum de Omni et Nullo) as
commonly expressed — ‘Whatever is true of a class is true of everything
included in the class,’ is a mere identical proposition, since the class
 <i>is</i> nothing but the things included in it. But he thinks this
defect would be cured by wording the maxim thus: ‘Whatever is true of a
class is true of everything which can be shown to be a member of the
class:’ as if a thing could be shown to be a member of the class without
 being one.”</p>
<p>
The qualified manner in which the maxim is here enunciated by the reviewer (what <i>can be shown</i>
 to be a member of the class) corresponds with the qualification
introduced by those critics whom Aristotle impugns (&#955;&#973;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#959;&#8016;
&#966;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#940;&#948;&#945; &#7936;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#963;&#945;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ <span class="gesp">&#7971;&#957; &#7988;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#965;&#940;&#962;</span>);
 and the reply of Mr. Mill would have suited for these critics as well
as for the reviewer. The puzzle started in the Platonic Menon is, at
bottom, founded on the same view as that of Mr. Mill, when he states
that the major proposition of the Syllogism includes beforehand the
conclusion. “The general principle, (says Mr. Mill, p. 205), instead of
being given as evidence of the particular case, cannot itself be taken
for true without exception, until every shadow of doubt which could
affect any case comprised in it is dispelled by evidence <i>aliunde</i>;
 and then what remains for the syllogism to prove? From a general
principle we cannot infer any particulars but those which the principle
itself assumes as known.”</p>
<p>
To enunciate this in the language of the Platonic Menon, we learn
nothing by or through the evidence of the Syllogism, except a part of
what we have already professed ourselves to know by asserting the major
premiss.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>Aristotle proceeds to tell us what is meant by knowing a thing <i>absolutely</i>
 or completely (&#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962;). It is when we believe ourselves to know the
cause or reason through which the matter known exists, so that it cannot
 but be as it is. That is what Demonstration, or Scientific Syllogism,
teaches us;<a name="FnAnchor7_12" href="#Footnote7_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
 a Syllogism derived from premisses true, immediate, prior to, and more
knowable than the conclusion — causes of the conclusion, and specially
appropriate thereto. These premisses must be known beforehand without
being demonstrated (<i>i.e.</i> known not through a middle term); and must be known not merely in the sense of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>understanding the signification of the terms, but also in that of being able to affirm the truth of the proposition. <i>Prior</i> or <i>more knowable</i> is understood here as prior or more knowable <i>by nature</i> (not <i>relatively to us</i>, according to the antithesis formerly explained); first, most universal, undemonstrable <i>principia</i>
 are meant. Some of these are Axioms, which the learner must “bring with
 him from home,” or know before the teacher can instruct him in any
special science; some are Definitions of the name and its essential
meaning; others, again, are Hypotheses or affirmations of the existence
of the thing defined, which the learner must accept upon the authority
of the teacher.<a name="FnAnchor7_13" href="#Footnote7_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> As these are the <i>principia</i>
 of Demonstration, so it is necessary that the learner should know them,
 not merely as well as the conclusions demonstrated, but even better;
and that among matters contradictory to the <i>principia</i> there should be none that he knows better or trusts more.<a name="FnAnchor7_14" href="#Footnote7_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

So also Zabarella (In lib. I. Post. Anal. Comm., p. 340, Op. ed. Venet. 1617): “Duæ illæ dictiones (<i>primis</i> et <i>immediatis</i>) unam tantum significant conditionem ordine secundam, non duas; idem namque est, principia esse medio carentia, ac esse prima.”</p></div>

 &#964;&#953;&#962;, &amp;c. This shows the difficulty of adhering precisely to a
scientific terminology. Theophrastus explains an axiom to be a sort of
&#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;, thus lapsing into the common loose use of the word. Yet still both
 he and Aristotle declare &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; to be of inferior intellectual worth as
compared with &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; (Anal. Post. I. xxiii.), while at the same time
they declare the Axiom to be the very maximum of scientific truth.
Theophrastus gave, as examples of Axioms, the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'maximum'">maxim</span>
 of Contradiction, universally applicable, and, “If equals be taken from
 equals the remainders will be equal,” applicable to homogeneous
quantities. Even Aristotle himself sometimes falls into the same vague
employment of &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;, as including the Axioms. See Metaphys. <span class="smcap">B.</span> ii. p. 996, b. 28; <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> iii. p. 1005, b. 33.</p></div>

In Aristotle’s time two doctrines had been advanced, in opposition to
the preceding theory: (1) Some denied the necessity of any
indemonstrable <i>principia</i>, and affirmed the possibility of, demonstrating backwards <i>ad infinitum</i>; (2) Others agreed in denying the necessity of any indemonstrable <i>principia</i>, but contended that demonstration in a circle is valid and legitimate — <i>e.g.</i>
 that A may be demonstrated by means of B, and B by means of A. Against
both these doctrines Aristotle enters his protest. The first of them —
the supposition of an interminable regress — he pronounces to be
obviously absurd: the second he declares tantamount to proving a thing
by itself; the circular demonstration, besides, having been shown to be
impossible, except in the First figure, with propositions in which the
predicate reciprocates or is co-extensive with the subject — a very
small proportion among propositions generally used in demonstrating.<a name="FnAnchor7_15" href="#Footnote7_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>Demonstrative
 Science is attained only by syllogizing from necessary premisses, such
as cannot possibly be other than they are. The predicate must be (1) <i>de omni</i>, (2) <i>per se</i>, (3) <i>quatenus ipsum</i>, so that it is a <i>Primum Universale</i>;
 this third characteristic not being realized without the preceding two.
 First, the predicate must belong, and belong at all times, to
everything called by the name of the subject. Next, it must belong
thereunto <i>per se</i>, or essentially; that is, either the predicate
must be stated in the definition declaring the essence of the subject,
or the subject must be stated in the definition declaring the essence of
 the predicate. The predicate must not be extra-essential to the
subject, nor attached to it as an adjunct from without, simply
concomitant or accidental. The like distinction holds in regard to
events: some are accidentally concomitant sequences which may or may not
 be realized (<i>e.g.</i>, a flash of lightning occurring when a man is
on his journey); in others, the conjunction is necessary or causal (as
when an animal dies under the sacrificial knife).<a name="FnAnchor7_16" href="#Footnote7_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Both these two characteristics (<i>de omni</i> and <i>per se</i>) are presupposed in the third (<i>quatenus ipsum</i>);
 but this last implies farther, that the predicate is attached to the
subject in the highest universality consistent with truth; <i>i.e.</i>,
that it is a First Universal, a primary predicate and not a derivative
predicate. Thus, the predicate of having its three angles equal to two
right angles, is a characteristic not merely <i>de omni</i> and <i>per se</i>, but also a First Universal, applied to a triangle. It is applied to a triangle, <i>quatenus</i> triangle, as a primary predicate. If applied to a subject of higher universality (<i>e.g.</i>, to every geometrical figure), it would not be always true. If applied to a subject of lower universality (<i>e.g.</i>, to a right-angled triangle or an isosceles triangle), it would be universally true and would be true <i>per se</i>, but it would be a derivative predicate and not a First Universal; it would not be applied to the isosceles <i>quatenus</i>
 isosceles, for there is a still higher Universal of which it is
predicable, being true respecting any triangle you please. Thus, the
properties with which Demonstration, or full and absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span> Science, is conversant, are <i>de omni</i>, <i>per se</i>, and <i>quatenus ipsum</i>, or <i>Universalia Prima</i>;<a name="FnAnchor7_17" href="#Footnote7_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> all of them necessary, such as cannot but be true.</p>

Aristotle remarks that there is great liability to error about these <i>Universalia Prima</i>. We sometimes demonstrate a predicate to be true, universally and <i>per se</i>, of a lower species, without being aware that it might also be demonstrated to be true, universally and <i>per se</i>,
 of the higher genus to which that species belongs; perhaps, indeed,
that higher genus may not yet have obtained a current name. That
proportions hold by permutation, was demonstrated severally for numbers,
 lines, solids, and intervals of time; but this belongs to each of them,
 not from any separate property of each, but from what is common to all:
 that, however, which is common to all had received no name, so that it
was not known that one demonstration might comprise all the four.<a name="FnAnchor7_18" href="#Footnote7_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
 In like manner, a man may know that an equilateral and an isosceles
triangle have their three angles equal to two right angles, and also
that a scalene triangle has its three angles equal to two right angles;
yet he may not know (except sophistically and by accident<a name="FnAnchor7_19" href="#Footnote7_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>) that a triangle <i>in genere</i>
 has its three angles equal to two right angles, though there be no
other triangles except equilateral, isosceles, and scalene. He does not
know that this may be demonstrated of every triangle <i>quatenus</i> triangle. The only way to obtain a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>certain recognition of <i>Primum Universale</i>,
 is, to abstract successively from the several conditions of a
demonstration respecting the concrete and particular, until the
proposition ceases to be true. Thus, you have before you a brazen
isosceles triangle, the three angles whereof are equal to two right
angles. You may eliminate the condition brazen, and the proposition will
 still remain true. You may also eliminate the condition isosceles;
still the proposition is true. But you cannot eliminate the condition
triangle, so as to retain only the higher genus, geometrical figure; for
 the proposition then ceases to be always true. Triangle is in this case
 the <i>Primum Universale</i>.<a name="FnAnchor7_20" href="#Footnote7_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

<p>
In every demonstration the <i>principia</i> or premisses must be not
only true, but necessarily true; the conclusion also will then be
necessarily true, by reason of the premisses, and this constitutes
Demonstration. Wherever the premisses are necessarily true, the
conclusion will be necessarily true; but you cannot say, <i>vice versâ</i>,
 that wherever the conclusion is necessarily true, the syllogistic
premisses from which it follows must always be necessarily true. They
may be true without being necessarily true, or they may even be false:
if, then, the conclusion be necessarily true, it is not so by reason of
these premisses; and the syllogistic proof is in this case no
demonstration. Your syllogism may have true premisses and may lead to a
conclusion which is true by reason of them; but still you have not
demonstrated, since neither premisses nor conclusion are <i>necessarily</i> true.<a name="FnAnchor7_21" href="#Footnote7_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> When an opponent contests your demonstration, he succeeds if he can disprove the <i>necessity</i> of your conclusion; if he can show any single case in which it either is or may be false.<a name="FnAnchor7_22" href="#Footnote7_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
 It is not enough to proceed upon a premiss which is either probable or
simply true: it may be true, yet not appropriate to the case: you must
take your departure from the first or highest universal of the genus
about which you attempt to demonstrate.<a name="FnAnchor7_23" href="#Footnote7_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Again, unless you can state the <i>why</i>
 of your conclusion; that is to say, unless the middle term, by reason
of which the conclusion is necessarily true, be itself necessarily true,
 — you have not demonstrated it, nor do you know it absolutely. Your <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>middle
 term not being necessary may vanish, while the conclusion to which it
was supposed to lead abides: in truth no conclusion was known through
that middle.<a name="FnAnchor7_24" href="#Footnote7_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> In the complete demonstrative or scientific syllogism, the major term must be predicable essentially or <i>per se</i> of the middle, and the middle term must be predicable essentially or <i>per se</i> of the minor; thus alone can you be sure that the conclusion also is <i>per se</i>
 or necessary. The demonstration cannot take effect through a middle
term which is merely a Sign; the sign, even though it be a constant
concomitant, yet being not, or at least not known to be, <i>per se</i>, will not bring out the <i>why</i>
 of the conclusion, nor make the conclusion necessary. Of non-essential
concomitants altogether there is no demonstration; wherefore it might
seem to be useless to put questions about such; yet, though the
questions cannot yield necessary premisses for a demonstrative
conclusion, they may yield premisses from which a conclusion will
necessarily follow.<a name="FnAnchor7_25" href="#Footnote7_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> </p>

On the point last mentioned, M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire observes in his
note, p. 41: “Dans les questions de dialectique, la conclusion est
nécessaire en ce sens, qu’elle suit nécessairement des prémisses; elle
n’est pas du tout nécessaire en ce sens, que la chose qu’elle exprime
soit nécessaire. Ainsi il faut distinguer la nécessité de la forme et la
 nécessité de la matière: ou comme disent les scholastiques, <i>necessitas illationis et necessitas materiæ</i>. La dialectique se contente de la première, mais la demonstration a essentiellement besoin des deux.”</p></div>
<p>
In every demonstration three things may be distinguished: (1) The
demonstrated conclusion, or Attribute essential to a certain genus; (2)
The Genus, of which the attributes <i>per se</i> are the matter of
demonstration; (3) The Axioms, out of which, or through which, the
demonstration is obtained. These Axioms may be and are common to several
 genera: but the demonstration cannot be transferred from one genus to
another; both the extremes as well as the middle term must belong to the
 same genus. An arithmetical demonstration cannot be transferred to
magnitudes and their properties, except in so far as magnitudes are
numbers, which is partially true of some among them. The demonstrations
in arithmetic may indeed be transferred to harmonics, because harmonics
is subordinate to arithmetic; and, for the like reason, demonstrations
in geometry may be transferred to mechanics and optics. But we cannot
introduce into geometry any property of lines, which does not belong to
them <i>quâ</i> lines; such, for example, as that a straight line is the
 most beautiful of all lines, or is the contrary of a circular line; for
 these predicates belong to it, not <i>quâ</i> line, but <i>quâ</i> member of a different or more extensive genus.<a name="FnAnchor7_26" href="#Footnote7_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> There can be no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>complete
 demonstration about perishable things, or about any individual line,
except in regard to its attributes as member of the genus line. Where
the conclusion is not eternally true, but true at one time and not true
at another, this can only be because one of its premisses is not
universal or essential. Where both premisses are universal and
essential, the conclusion must be eternal or eternally true. As there is
 no demonstration, so also there can be no definition, of perishable
attributes.<a name="FnAnchor7_27" href="#Footnote7_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

 Ibid. vii. p. 75, a. 38-b. 20. Mr. Poste, in his translation, here
cites (p. 50) a good illustrative passage from Dr. Whewell’s Philosophy
of the Inductive Sciences, Book II. ii.:— “But, in order that we may
make any real advance in the discovery of truth, our ideas must not only
 be clear; they must also be <i>appropriate</i>. Each science has for
its basis a different class of ideas; and the steps which constitute the
 progress of one science can never be made by employing the ideas of
another kind of science. No genuine advance could ever be obtained in
Mechanics by applying to the subject the ideas of space and time merely;
 no advance in Chemistry by the use of mere mechanical conceptions; no
discovery in Physiology by referring facts to mere chemical and
mechanical principles.” &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>
For complete demonstration, it is not sufficient that the premisses be
true, immediate, and undemonstrable; they must, furthermore, be
essential and appropriate to the class in hand. Unless they be such, you
 cannot be said to know the conclusion <i>absolutely</i>; you know it
only by accident. You can only know a conclusion when demonstrated from
its own appropriate premisses; and you know it best when it is
demonstrated from its highest premisses. It is sometimes difficult to
determine whether we really know or not; for we fancy that we know, when
 we demonstrate from true and universal <i>principia</i>, without being aware whether they are, or are not, the <i>principia</i> appropriate to the case.<a name="FnAnchor7_28" href="#Footnote7_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> But these <i>principia</i>
 must always be assumed without demonstration — the class whose
essential constituent properties are in question, the universal Axioms,
and the Definition or meaning of the attributes to be demonstrated. If
these definitions and axioms are not always formally enunciated, it is
because we tacitly presume them to be already known and admitted by the
learner.<a name="FnAnchor7_29" href="#Footnote7_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 He may indeed always refuse to grant them in express words, but they
are such that he cannot help granting them by internal assent in his
mind, to which every syllogism must address itself. When you assume a
premiss without demonstrating it, though it be really demonstrable,
this, if the learner is favourable and willing to grant it, is an
assumption or Hypothesis, valid relatively to him alone, but not valid
absolutely: if he is reluctant or adverse, it is a Postulate, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>you claim whether he is satisfied or not.<a name="FnAnchor7_30" href="#Footnote7_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
 The Definition by itself is not an hypothesis; for it neither affirms
nor denies the existence of anything. The pupil must indeed understand
the terms of it; but this alone is not an hypothesis, unless you call
the fact that the pupil comes to learn, an hypothesis.<a name="FnAnchor7_31" href="#Footnote7_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
 The Hypothesis or assumption is contained in the premisses, being that
by which the reason of the conclusion comes to be true. Some object that
 the geometer makes a false hypothesis or assumption, when he declares a
 given line drawn to be straight, or to be a foot long, though it is
neither one nor the other. But this objection has no pertinence, since
the geometer does not derive his conclusions from what is true of the
visible lines drawn before his eyes, but from what is true of the lines
conceived in his own mind, and signified or illustrated by the visible
diagrams.<a name="FnAnchor7_32" href="#Footnote7_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a></p>

The process of Demonstration neither requires, nor countenances, the
Platonic theory of Ideas — universal substances beyond and apart from
particulars. But it does require that we should admit universal
predications; that is, one and the same predicate truly applicable in
the same sense to many different particulars. Unless this be so, there
can be no universal major premiss, nor appropriate middle term, nor
valid demonstrative syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor7_33" href="#Footnote7_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>

The Maxim or Axiom of Contradiction, in its most general enunciation, is
 never formally enunciated by any special science; but each of them
assumes the Maxim so far as applicable to its own purpose, whenever the <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> is introduced.<a name="FnAnchor7_34" href="#Footnote7_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
 It is in this and the other common principles or Axioms that all the
sciences find their point of contact and communion; and that Dialectic
also comes into communion with all of them, as also the science (First
Philosophy) that scrutinizes the validity or demonstrability of the
Axioms.<a name="FnAnchor7_35" href="#Footnote7_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> The dialectician is not confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
 to any one science, or to any definite subject-matter. His liberty of
interrogation is unlimited; but his procedure is essentially
interrogatory, and he is bound to accept the answer of the respondent —
whatever it be, affirmative or negative — as premiss for any syllogism
that he may construct. In this way he can never be sure of demonstrating
 any thing; for the affirmative and the negative will not be equally
serviceable for that purpose. There is indeed also, in discussions on
the separate sciences, a legitimate practice of scientific
interrogation. Here the questions proper to be put are limited in
number, and the answers proper to be made are determined beforehand by
the truths of the science — say Geometry; still, an answer thus
correctly made will serve to the interrogator as premiss for syllogistic
 demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor7_36" href="#Footnote7_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> The respondent must submit to have such answer tested by appeal to geometrical <i>principia</i> and to other geometrical propositions already proved as legitimate conclusions from the <i>principia</i>; if he finds himself involved in contradictions, he is confuted <i>quâ</i> geometer, and must correct or modify his answer. But he is not bound, <i>quâ</i> geometer, to undergo scrutiny as to the geometrical <i>principia</i>
 themselves; this would carry the dialogue out of the province of
Geometry into that of First Philosophy and Dialectic. Care, indeed, must
 be taken to keep both questions and answers within the limits of the
science. Now there can be no security for this restriction, except in
the scientific competence of the auditors. Refrain, accordingly, from
all geometrical discussions among men ignorant of geometry and confine
yourself to geometrical auditors, who alone can distinguish what
questions and answers are really appropriate. And what is here said
about geometry, is equally true about the other special sciences.<a name="FnAnchor7_37" href="#Footnote7_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 Answers may be improper either as foreign to the science under debate,
or as appertaining to the science, yet false as to the matter, or as
equivocal in middle term; though this last is less likely to occur in
Geometry, since the demonstrations are accompanied by diagrams, which
help <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>to render conspicuous any such ambiguity.<a name="FnAnchor7_38" href="#Footnote7_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
 To an inductive proposition, bringing forward a single case as
contributory to an ultimate generalization, no general objection should
be offered; the objection should be reserved until the generalization
itself is tendered.<a name="FnAnchor7_39" href="#Footnote7_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
 Sometimes the mistake is made of drawing an affirmative conclusion from
 premisses in the Second figure; this is formally wrong, but the
conclusion may in some cases be true, if the major premiss happens to be
 a reciprocating proposition, having its predicate co-extensive with its
 subject. This, however, cannot be presumed; nor can a conclusion be
made to yield up its principles by necessary reciprocation; for we have
already observed that, though the truth of the premisses certifies the
truth of the conclusion, we cannot say <i>vice versâ</i> that the truth
of the conclusion certifies the truth of the premisses. Yet propositions
 are more frequently found to reciprocate in scientific discussion than
in Dialectic; because, in the former, we take no account of accidental
properties, but only of definitions and what follows from them.<a name="FnAnchor7_40" href="#Footnote7_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

 b. 34 seq. This passage is to me hardly intelligible. It is differently
 understood by commentators and translators. John Philoponus in the
Scholia (p. 217, b. 17-32, Brandis), cites the explanation of it given
by Ammonius, but rejects that explanation, and waits for others to
supply him with a better. Zabarella (Comm. in Analyt. Post. pp. 426,
456, ed. Venet 1617) admits that as it stands, and where it stands, it
is unintelligible, but transposes it to another part of the book (to the

Knowledge of Fact and knowledge of the Cause must be distinguished, and even within the same Science.<a name="FnAnchor7_41" href="#Footnote7_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a>
 In some syllogisms the conclusion only brings out &#964;&#8056; &#8005;&#964;&#953; — the reality
of certain facts; in others, it ends in &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; — the affirmation of a
cause, or of the <i>Why</i>. The syllogism of the <i>Why</i> is, where
the middle term is not merely the cause, but the proximate cause, of the
 conclusion. Often, however, the effect is more notorious, so that we
employ it as middle term, and conclude from it to its reciprocating
cause; in which case our syllogism is only of the &#8005;&#964;&#953;; and so it is also
 when we employ as middle term a cause not proximate but remote,
concluding from that to the effect.<a name="FnAnchor7_42" href="#Footnote7_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
 the syllogisms of the &#8005;&#964;&#953; may fall under one science, those of the
&#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; under another, namely, in the case where one science is
subordinate to another, as optics to geometry, and harmonics to
arithmetic; the facts of optics and harmonics belonging to sense and
observation, the causes thereof to mathematical reasoning. It may
happen, then, that a man knows &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; well, but is comparatively
ignorant &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8005;&#964;&#953;: the geometer may have paid little attention to optical
 facts.<a name="FnAnchor7_43" href="#Footnote7_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
 Cognition of the &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; is the maximum, the perfection, of all
cognition; and this, comprising arithmetical and geometrical theorems,
is almost always attained by syllogisms in the First figure. This figure
 is the most truly scientific of the three; the other two figures depend
 upon it for expansion and condensation. It is, besides, the only one in
 which universal affirmative conclusions can be obtained; for in the
Second figure we get only negative conclusions; in the Third, only
particular. Accordingly, propositions declaring Essence or Definition,
obtained only through universal affirmative conclusions, are yielded in
none but the First figure.<a name="FnAnchor7_44" href="#Footnote7_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

As there are some affirmative propositions that are indivisible, <i>i.e.</i>,
 having affirmative predicates which belong to a subject at once,
directly, immediately, indivisibly, — so there are also some indivisible
 negative propositions, <i>i.e.</i>, with predicates that belong
negatively to a subject at once, directly, &amp;c. In all such there is
no intermediate step to justify either the affirmation of the predicate,
 or the negation of the predicate, respecting the given subject. This

especially insists upon is, that there may be and are immediate,

 of this treatise (p. 72, b. 19), that there were <i>affirmative</i>
predicates immediate and undemonstrable. This may be compared with that
which Plato declares in the Sophistes (pp. 253-254, seq.) about the
intercommunion &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8182;&#957; with each other. Some of them

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>In
regard both to these propositions immediate and indivisible, and to
propositions mediate and deducible, there are two varieties of error.<a name="FnAnchor7_46" href="#Footnote7_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 You may err simply, from ignorance, not knowing better, and not
supposing yourself to know at all; or your error may be a false
conclusion, deduced by syllogism through a middle term, and accompanied
by a belief on your part that you do know. This may happen in different
ways. Suppose the negative proposition, No B is A, to be true
immediately or indivisibly. Then, if you conclude the contrary of this<a name="FnAnchor7_47" href="#Footnote7_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 (All B is A) to be true, by syllogism through the middle term C, your
syllogism must be in the First figure; it must have the minor premiss
false (since B is brought under C, when it is not contained in any
higher genus), and it may have both premisses false. Again, suppose the
affirmative proposition, All B is A, to be true immediately or
indivisibly. Then if you conclude the contrary of this (No B is A) to be
 true, by syllogism through the middle term C, your syllogism may be in
the First figure, but it may also be in the Second figure, your false
conclusion being negative. If it be in the First figure, both its
premisses may be false, or one of them only may be false, either
indifferently.<a name="FnAnchor7_48" href="#Footnote7_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> If it be in the Second figure, either premiss singly may be wholly false, or both may be partly false.<a name="FnAnchor7_49" href="#Footnote7_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>

uncombined ideas, ignorance is not possible as an erroneous combination,
 but only as a mental blank. You either have the idea and thus know so
much truth, or you have not the idea and are thus ignorant to that
extent; this is the only alternative. Cf. Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">&#920;</span>. p. 1051, a. 34; De Animâ, III. vi. p. 430, a. 26.</p></div>

(p. 95, n.):— “Il faut remarquer qu’Aristote ne s’occupe que des modes
universels dans la première et dans la seconde figure, parceque, la
démonstration étant toujours universelle, les propositions qui expriment
 l’erreur opposée doivent l’être comme elle. Ainsi ce sont les
propositions contraires, et non les contradictoires, dont il sera
question ici.”</p>
<p>
For the like reason the Third figure is not mentioned here, but only the
 First and Second: because in the Third figure no universal conclusion
can be proved (Julius Pacius, p. 431).</p></div>

Let us next assume the affirmative proposition, All B is A, to be true,
but mediate and deducible through the middle term C. If you conclude the
 contrary of this (No B is A) through the same middle term C, in the
First figure, your error cannot arise from falsity in the minor premiss,
 because your minor (by the laws of the figure) must be affirmative;
your error must arise from a false major, because a negative major is
not inconsistent with the laws of the First figure. On the other hand,
if you conclude the contrary in the First figure through a different <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>middle term, D, either both your premisses will be false, or your minor premiss will be false.<a name="FnAnchor7_50" href="#Footnote7_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
 If you employ the Second figure to conclude your contrary, both your
premisses cannot be false, though either one of them singly may be
false.<a name="FnAnchor7_51" href="#Footnote7_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a></p>

<p>
Such will be the case when the deducible proposition assumed to be true
is affirmative, and when therefore the contrary conclusion which you
profess to have proved is negative. But if the deducible proposition
assumed to be true is negative, and if consequently the contrary
conclusion must be affirmative, — then, if you try to prove this
contrary through the same middle term, your premisses cannot both be
false, but your major premiss must always be false.<a name="FnAnchor7_52" href="#Footnote7_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
 If, however, you try to prove the contrary through a different and
inappropriate middle term, you cannot convert the minor premiss to its
contrary (because the minor premiss must continue affirmative, in order
that you may arrive at any conclusion at all), but the major can be so
converted. Should the major premiss thus converted be true, the minor
will be false; should the major premiss thus converted be false, the
minor may be either true or false. Either one of the premisses, or both
the premisses, may thus be false.<a name="FnAnchor7_53" href="#Footnote7_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> </p>

Errors of simple ignorance (not concluded from false syllogism) may
proceed from defect or failure of sensible perception, in one or other
of its branches. For without sensation there can be no induction; and it
 is from induction only that the premisses for demonstration by
syllogism are obtained. We cannot arrive at universal propositions, even
 in what are called abstract sciences, except through induction of
particulars; nor can we demonstrate except from universals. Induction
and Demonstration are the only two ways of learning; and the particulars
 composing our inductions can only be known through sense.<a name="FnAnchor7_54" href="#Footnote7_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a></p>

 Analyt. Post. I. xviii. p. 81, a. 38-b. 9. In this important chapter
(the doctrines of which are more fully expanded in the last chapter of
the Second Book of the Analyt. Post.), the text of Waitz does not fully
agree with that of Julius Pacius. In Firmin Didot’s edition the text is
the same as in Waitz; but his Latin translation remains adapted to that
of Julius Pacius. Waitz gives the substance of the chapter as follows
(ad Organ. II. p. 347):— “Universales propositiones omnes inductione
comparantur, quum etiam in iis, quæ a sensibus maxime aliena videntur et
 quæ, ut mathematica (&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#958; &#7936;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;), cogitatione separantur à
materia quacum conjuncta sunt, inductione probentur ea quæ de genero
(e.g., de linea vel de corpore mathematico), ad quod demonstratio
pertineat, prædicentur &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#940; et cum ejus natura conjuncta sint.
Inductio autem iis nititur quæ sensibus percipiuntur; nam res singulares
 sentiuntur, scientia vero rerum singularium non datur sine inductione,
non datur inductio sine sensu.”</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle next proceeds to show (what in previous passages he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>had assumed)<a name="FnAnchor7_55" href="#Footnote7_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a>
 that, if Demonstration or the syllogistic process be possible — if
there be any truths supposed demonstrable, this implies that there must
be primary or ultimate truths. It has been explained that the
constituent elements assumed in the Syllogism are three terms and two
propositions or premisses; in the major premiss, A is affirmed (or
denied) of all B; in the minor, B is affirmed of all C; in the
conclusion, A is affirmed (or denied) of all C.<a name="FnAnchor7_56" href="#Footnote7_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a>
 Now it is possible that there may be some one or more predicates higher
 than A, but it is impossible that there can be an infinite series of
such higher predicates. So also there may be one or more subjects lower
than C, and of which C will be the predicate; but it is impossible that
there can be an infinite series of such lower subjects. In like manner
there may perhaps be one or more middle terms between A and B, and
between B and C; but it is impossible that there can be an infinite
series of such intervening middle terms. There must be a limit to the
series ascending, descending, or intervening.<a name="FnAnchor7_57" href="#Footnote7_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> These remarks have no application to reciprocating propositions, in which the predicate is co-extensive with the subject.<a name="FnAnchor7_58" href="#Footnote7_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> But they apply alike to demonstrations negative and affirmative, and alike to all the three figures of Syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor7_59" href="#Footnote7_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a></p>

<p>
In Dialectical Syllogism it is enough if the premisses be admitted or
reputed as propositions immediately true, whether they are so in reality
 or not; but in Scientific or Demonstrative Syllogism they must be so in
 reality: the demonstration is not complete unless it can be traced up
to premisses that are thus immediately or directly true (without any
intervening middle term).<a name="FnAnchor7_60" href="#Footnote7_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
 That there are and must be such primary or immediate premisses,
Aristotle now undertakes to prove, by some dialectical reasons, and
other analytical or scientific reasons.<a name="FnAnchor7_61" href="#Footnote7_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> He himself <span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>thus
 distinguishes them; but the distinction is faintly marked, and amounts,
 at most, to this, that the analytical reasons advert only to essential
predication, and to the conditions of scientific demonstration, while
the dialectical reasons dwell upon these, but include something else
besides, viz., accidental predication. The proof consists mainly in the
declaration that, unless we assume some propositions to be true
immediately, indivisibly, undemonstrably, — Definition, Demonstration,
and Science would be alike impossible. If the ascending series of
predicates is endless, so that we never arrive at a highest generic
predicate; if the descending series of subjects is endless, so that we
never reach a lowest subject, — no definition can ever be attained. The
essential properties included in the definition, must be finite in
number; and the accidental predicates must also be finite in number,
since they have no existence except as attached to some essential
subject, and since they must come under one or other of the nine later
Categories.<a name="FnAnchor7_62" href="#Footnote7_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>
 If, then, the two extremes are thus fixed and finite — the highest
predicate and the lowest subject — it is impossible that there can be an
 infinite series of terms between the two. The intervening terms must be
 finite in number. The Aristotelian theory therefore is, that there are
certain propositions directly and immediately true, and others derived
from them by demonstration through middle terms.<a name="FnAnchor7_63" href="#Footnote7_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> It is alike an error to assert that every thing can be demonstrated, and that nothing can be demonstrated.</p>

Aristotle, however, does not always adhere closely to the distinction. Thus, if we compare the <i>logical</i> or <i>dialectical</i> reasons given, p. 82, b. 37, seq., with the <i>analytical</i>,
 announced as beginning p. 84, a. 8, seq., we find the same main topic
dwelt upon in both, namely, that to admit an infinite series excludes
the possibility of Definition. Both Alexander and Ammonius agree in
announcing this as the capital topic on which the proof turned; but
Alexander inferred from hence that the argument was purely <i>dialectical</i>
 (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;), while Ammonius regarded it as a reason thoroughly

 Ibid. I. xxii. p. 84, a. 30-35. The paraphrase of Themistius (pp.
55-58, Spengel) states the Aristotelian reasoning in clearer language
than Aristotle himself. Zabarella (Comm. in Analyt. Post. I. xviii.;
context. 148, 150, 154) repeats that Aristotle’s proof is founded upon
the undeniable fact that there <i>are</i> definitions, and that without
them there could be no demonstration and no science. This excludes the
supposition of an infinite series of predicates and of middle terms:—
“Sumit rationem à definitione; si in <i>predicatis in quid</i>
procederetur ad infinitum, sequeretur auferri definitionem et omnino
essentiæ cognitionem; sed hoc dicendum non est, quum omnium consensioni
adversetur” (p. 466, Ven. 1617).</p></div>
<p>
It is plain from Aristotle’s own words<a name="FnAnchor7_64" href="#Footnote7_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
 that he intended these four chapters (xix.-xxii.) as a confirmation of
what he had already asserted in chapter iii. of the present treatise,
and as farther refutation of the two distinct classes of opponents there
 indicated: (1) those who said that everything was demonstrable,
demonstration in a circle being admissible; (2) those who said that
nothing was demonstrable, inasmuch as the train of predication<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
 upwards, downwards, and intermediate, was infinite. Both these two
classes of opponents agreed in saying, that there were no truths
immediate and indemonstrable; and it is upon this point that Aristotle
here takes issue with them, seeking to prove that there are and must be
such truths. But I cannot think the proof satisfactory; nor has it
appeared so to able commentators either of ancient or modern times —
from Alexander of Aphrodisias down to Mr. Poste.<a name="FnAnchor7_65" href="#Footnote7_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> The elaborate amplification <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>added
 in these last chapters adds no force to the statement already given at
the earlier stage; and it is in one respect a change for the worse,
inasmuch as it does not advert to the important distinction announced in
 chapter iii., between universal truths known by Induction (from sense
and particulars), and universal truths known by Deduction from these.
The truths immediate and indemonstrable (not known through a middle
term) are the inductive truths, as Aristotle declares in many places,
and most emphatically at the close of the Analytica Posteriora. But in
these chapters, he hardly alludes to Induction. Moreover, while trying
to prove that there must be immediate universal truths, he neither gives
 any complete list of them, nor assigns any positive characteristic
whereby to identify them. Opponents might ask him whether these
immediate universal truths were not ready-made inspirations of the mind;
 and if so, what better authority they had than the Platonic Ideas,
which are contemptuously dismissed.</p>

After saying that the first of Aristotle’s <i>dialectical</i> proofs is faulty, and that the second is a <i>petitio principii</i>, Mr. Poste adds, respecting the so-called <i>analytical</i>
 proof given by Aristotle:— “It is not so much a proof, as a more
accurate determination of the principle to be postulated. This
postulate, the existence of first principles, as concerning the
constitution of the world, appears to belong properly to Metaphysics,
and is merely borrowed by Logic. See Metaph. ii. 2, and Introduction.”
In the passage of the Metaphysica (&#945;. p. 994) here cited the main
argument of Aristotle is open to the same objection of <i>petitio principii</i> which Mr. Poste urges against Aristotle’s second <i>dialectical</i> argument in this place.</p>
<p>
Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his System of Logic, takes for granted that there <i>must</i>
 be immediate, indemonstrable truths, to serve as a basis for deduction;
 “that there cannot be a chain of proof suspended from nothing;” that
there must be ultimate laws of nature, though we cannot be sure that the
 laws now known to us are ultimate.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, we read in the recent work of an acute contemporary
philosopher, Professor Delbœuf (Essai de Logique Scientifique, Liège,
1865, Pref. pp. v, vii, viii, pp. 46, 47:) — “Il est des points sur
lesquels je crains de ne m’être pas expliqué assez nettement, entre
autres la question du fondement de la certitude. Je suis de ceux qui
repoussent de toutes leurs forces l’axiome si spécieux qu’on ne peut
tout démontrer; cette proposition aurait, à mes yeux, plus besoin que
toute autre d’une démonstration. Cette démonstration ne sera en partie
donnée que quand on aura une bonne fois énuméré toutes les propositions
indémontrables; et quand on aura bien défini le caractère auquel on les
reconnait. Nulle part on ne trouve ni une semblable énumération, ni une
semblable définition. On reste à cet égard dans une position vague, et
par cela même facile à défendre.”</p>
<p>
It would seem, by these words, that M. Delbœuf stands in the most direct
 opposition to Aristotle, who teaches us that the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; or <i>principia</i>
 from which demonstration starts cannot be themselves demonstrated. But
when we compare other passages of M. Delbœuf’s work, we find that, in
rejecting all undemonstrable propositions, what he really means is to
reject all <i>self-evident universal truths</i>, “C’est donc une
véritable illusion d’admettre des vérités évidentes par elles-mêmes. Il
n’y a pas de proposition fausse que nous ne soyons disposés d’admettre
comme axiome, quand rien ne nous a encore autorisés à la repousser” (p.
ix.). This is quite true in my opinion; but the immediate indemonstrable
 truths for which Aristotle contends as &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; of demonstration, are not
announced by him as <i>self-evident</i>, they are declared to be results
 of sense and induction, to be raised from observation of particulars
multiplied, compared, and permanently formularized under the
intellectual <i>habitus</i> called Noûs. By Demonstration Aristotle
means deduction in its most perfect form, beginning from these &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054;
which are inductively known but not demonstrable (<i>i. e.</i> not
knowable deductively). And in this view the very able and instructive
treatise of M. Delbœuf mainly coincides, assigning even greater
preponderance to the inductive process, and approximating in this
respect to the important improvements in logical theory advanced by Mr.
John Stuart Mill.</p>
<p>
Among the universal propositions which are not derived from Induction,
but which serve as &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; for Deduction and Demonstration, we may reckon
the religious, ethical, æsthetical, social, political, &amp;c., beliefs
received in each different community, and impressed upon all newcomers
born into it by the force of precept, example, authority. Here the major
 premiss is felt by each individual as carrying an authority of its own,
 stamped and enforced by the sanction of society, and by the disgrace or
 other penalties in store for those who disobey it. It is ready to be
interpreted and diversified by suitable minor premisses in all
inferential applications. But these &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; for deduction, differing
widely at different times and places, though generated in the same
manner and enforced by the same sanction, would belong more properly to
the class which Aristotle terms &#964;&#8048; &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;.</p></div>
<p>
We have thus recognized that there exist immediate (ultimate or primary)
 propositions, wherein the conjunction between predicate and subject is
such that no intermediate term can be assigned between them. When A is
predicated both of B and C, this may perhaps be in consequence of some
common property possessed by B and C, and such common property will form
 a middle term. For example, equality of angles to two right angles
belongs both to an isosceles and to a scalene triangle, and it belongs
to them by reason of their common property — triangular figure; which
last is thus the middle term. But this need not be always the case.<a name="FnAnchor7_66" href="#Footnote7_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
 It is possible that the two propositions — A predicated of B, A
predicated of C — may both of them be immediate propositions; and that
there may be no community of nature between B and C. Whenever a middle
term can be found, demonstration is possible; but where no middle term
can be found, demonstration is impossible. The proposition, whether
affirmative or negative, is then an immediate or indivisible one. Such
propositions, and the terms of which they are composed, are the ultimate
 elements or <i>principia</i> of Demonstration. Predicate and subject
are brought constantly into closer and closer conjunction, until at last
 they become one and indivisible.<a name="FnAnchor7_67" href="#Footnote7_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Here we reach the unit or element <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>of
 the syllogizing process. In all scientific calculations there is
assumed an unit to start from, though in each branch of science it is a
different unit; <i>e.g.</i> in barology, the pound-weight; in harmonics, the quarter-tone; in other branches of science, other units.<a name="FnAnchor7_68" href="#Footnote7_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
 Analytical research teaches us that the corresponding unit in Syllogism
 is the affirmative or negative proposition which is primary, immediate,
 indivisible. In Demonstration and Science it is the Noûs or Intellect.<a name="FnAnchor7_69" href="#Footnote7_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a></p>

<p>
Having thus, in the long preceding reasoning, sought to prove that all
demonstration must take its departure from primary undemonstrable <i>principia</i>
 — from some premisses, affirmative and negative, which are directly
true in themselves, and not demonstrable through any middle term or
intervening propositions, Aristotle now passes to a different enquiry.
We have some demonstrations in which the conclusion is Particular,
others in which it is Universal: again, some Affirmative, some Negative,
 Which of the two, in each of these alternatives, is the best? We have
also demonstrations Direct or Ostensive, and demonstrations Indirect or
by way of <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>. Which of these two is the best? Both questions appear to have been subjected to debate by contemporary philosophers.<a name="FnAnchor7_70" href="#Footnote7_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a></p>

<p>
Aristotle discusses these points dialectically (as indeed he points out
in the Topica that the comparison of two things generally, as to better
and worse, falls under the varieties of <span class="correction" title="amended from 'dialetical'">dialectical</span> enquiry<a name="FnAnchor7_71" href="#Footnote7_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>),
 first stating and next refuting the arguments on the weaker side. Some
persons may think (he says) that demonstration of the Particular is
better than demonstration of the Universal: first, because it conducts
to fuller cognition of that which the thing is in itself, and not merely
 that which it is <i>quatenus</i> member of a class; secondly, because
demonstrations of the Universal are apt to generate an illusory belief,
that the Universal is a distinct reality apart from and independent of
all its particulars (<i>i.e.</i>, that figure in general has a real
existence apart from all particular figures, and number in general apart
 from all particular numbers, &amp;c.), while demonstrations of the
Particular do not lead to any such illusion.<a name="FnAnchor7_72" href="#Footnote7_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>To
these arguments Aristotle replies:— 1. It is not correct to say that
cognition of the Particular is more complete, or bears more upon real
existence, than cognition of the Universal. The reverse would be nearer
to the truth. To know that the isosceles, <i>quatenus</i> triangle, has
its three angles equal to two right angles, is more complete cognition
than knowing simply that the isosceles has its three angles equal to two
 right angles. 2. If the Universal be not an equivocal term — if it
represents one property and one definition common to many particulars,
it then has a real existence as much or more than any one or any number
of the particulars. For all these particulars are perishable, but the
class is imperishable. 3. He who believes that the universal term has
one meaning in all the particulars, need not necessarily believe that it
 has any meaning <i>apart</i> from all particulars; he need not believe
this about Quiddity, any more than he believes it about Quality or
Quantity. Or if he does believe so, it is his own individual mistake,
not imputable to the demonstration. 4. We have shown that a complete
demonstration is one in which the middle term is the cause or reason of
the conclusion. Now the Universal is most of the nature of Cause; for it
 represents the First Essence or the <i>Per Se</i>, and is therefore its
 own cause, or has no other cause behind it. The demonstration of the
Universal has thus more of the Cause or the <i>Why</i>, and is therefore
 better than the demonstration of the Particular. 5. In the Final Cause
or End of action, there is always some ultimate end for the sake of
which the intermediate ends are pursued, and which, as it is better than
 they, yields, when it is known, the only complete explanation of the
action. So it is also with the Formal Cause: there is one highest form
which contains the <i>Why</i> of the subordinate forms, and the
knowledge of which is therefore better; as when, for example, the
exterior angles of a given isosceles triangle are seen to be equal to
four right angles, not because it is isosceles or triangle, but because
it is a rectilineal figure. 6. Particulars, as such, fall into infinity
of number, and are thus unknowable; the Universal tends towards oneness
and simplicity, and is thus essentially knowable, more fully
demonstrable than the infinity of particulars. The demonstration thereof
 is therefore better. 7. It is also better, on another ground; for he
that knows the Universal does in a certain sense know also the
Particular;<a name="FnAnchor7_73" href="#Footnote7_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a> but he that knows the Particular cannot be said in any sense to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>know the Universal. 8. The <i>principium</i> or perfection of cognition is to be found in the immediate proposition, true <i>per se</i>. When we demonstrate, and thus employ a middle term, the nearer the middle term approaches to that <i>principium</i>,
 the better the demonstration is. The demonstration of the Universal is
thus better and more accurate than that of the Particular.<a name="FnAnchor7_74" href="#Footnote7_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a></p>

<p>
Such are the several reasons enumerated by Aristotle in refutation of
the previous opinion stated in favour of the Particular. Evidently he
does not account them all of equal value: he intimates that some are
purely dialectical (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#940;); and he insists most upon the two
following:— 1. He that knows the Universal knows in a certain sense the
Particular; if he knows that every triangle has its three angles equal
to two right angles, he knows potentially that the isosceles has its
three angles equal to the same, though he may not know as yet that the
isosceles <i>is</i> a triangle. But he that knows the Particular does not in any way know the Universal, either actually or potentially.<a name="FnAnchor7_75" href="#Footnote7_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a>
 2. The Universal is apprehended by Intellect or Noûs, the highest of
all cognitive powers; the Particular terminates in sensation. Here, I
presume, he means, that, in demonstration of the Particular, the
conclusion teaches you nothing more than you might have learnt from a
direct observation of sense; whereas in that of the Universal the
conclusion teaches you more than you could have learnt from direct
sensation, and comes into correlation with the highest form of our
intellectual nature.<a name="FnAnchor7_76" href="#Footnote7_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a></p>

<p>
Next, Aristotle compares the Affirmative with the Negative
demonstration, and shows that the Affirmative is the better. Of two
demonstrations (he lays it down) that one which proceeds upon a smaller
number of postulates, assumptions, or propositions, is better than the
other; for, to say nothing of other reasons, it conducts you more
speedily to knowledge than the other, and that is an advantage. Now,
both in the affirmative and in the negative syllogism, you must have
three terms and two propositions; but in the affirmative you assume only
 that something <i>is</i>; while in the negative you assume both that something <i>is</i>, and that something <i>is not</i>. Here is a double assumption instead of a single; therefore the negative is the worse or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>inferior of the two.<a name="FnAnchor7_77" href="#Footnote7_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a>
 Moreover, for the demonstration of a negative conclusion, you require
one affirmative premiss (since from two negative premisses nothing
whatever can be concluded); while for the demonstration of an
affirmative conclusion, you must have two affirmative premisses, and you
 cannot admit a negative. This, again, shows that the affirmative is
logically prior, more trustworthy, and better than the negative.<a name="FnAnchor7_78" href="#Footnote7_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> The negative is only intelligible and knowable through the affirmative, just as <i>Non-Ens</i> is knowable only through <i>Ens</i>. The affirmative demonstration therefore, as involving better principles, is, on this ground also, better than the negative.<a name="FnAnchor7_79" href="#Footnote7_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> <i>A fortiori</i>, it is also better than the demonstration by way of <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>,
 which was the last case to be considered. This, as concluding only
indirectly and from impossibility of the contradictory, is worse even
than the negative; much more therefore is it worse than the direct
affirmative.<a name="FnAnchor7_80" href="#Footnote7_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a></p>

Philoponus says (Schol. pp. 234-235<span class="correction" title="amended from '.'">,</span> Brand.) that the Commentators all
censured Aristotle for the manner in which he here laid out the
Syllogism &#948;&#953;’ &#7936;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;. I do not, however, find any such censure in
Themistius. Philoponus defends Aristotle from the censure.</p></div>
<p>
If we next compare one Science with another, the prior and more accurate
 of the two is, (1) That which combines at once the &#8005;&#964;&#953; and the &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;;
(2) That which is abstracted from material conditions, as compared with
that which is immersed therein — for example, arithmetic is more
accurate than harmonics; (3) The more simple as compared with the more
complex: thus, arithmetic is more accurate than geometry, a monad or
unit is a substance without position, whereas a point (more concrete) is
 a substance with position.<a name="FnAnchor7_81" href="#Footnote7_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
 One and the same science is that which belongs to one and the same
generic subject-matter. The premisses of a demonstration must be
included in the same genus with the conclusion; and where the ultimate
premisses are heterogeneous, the cognition derived from them must be
considered as not one but a compound of several.<a name="FnAnchor7_82" href="#Footnote7_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a>
 You may find two or more distinct middle terms for demonstrating the
same conclusion; sometimes out of the same logical series or table,
sometimes out of different tables.<a name="FnAnchor7_83" href="#Footnote7_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a></p>

 Analyt. Post. I. xxix. p. 87, b. 5-18. Aristotle gives an example to
illustrate this general doctrine: &#7973;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#8056; &#7968;&#961;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;,
 &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957;. As he includes these terms and this subject among the
topics for demonstration, it is difficult to see where he would draw a
distinct line between topics for Demonstration and topics for Dialectic.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>There cannot be demonstrative cognition of fortuitous events,<a name="FnAnchor7_84" href="#Footnote7_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>
 for all demonstration is either of the necessary or of the customary.
Nor can there be demonstrative cognition through sensible perception.
For though by sense we perceive a thing as such and such (through its
sensible qualities), yet we perceive it inevitably as <i>hoc aliquid</i>, <i>hic</i>, <i>et nunc</i>. But the Universal cannot be perceived by sense; for it is neither <i>hic</i> nor <i>nunc</i>, but <i>semper et ubique</i>.<a name="FnAnchor7_85" href="#Footnote7_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
 Now demonstrations are all accomplished by means of the Universal, and
demonstrative cognition cannot therefore be had through sensible
perception. If the equality of the three angles of a triangle to two
right angles were a fact directly perceivable by sense, we should still
have looked out for a demonstration thereof: we should have no proper
scientific cognition of it (though some persons contend for this): for
sensible perception gives us only particular cases, and Cognition or
Science proper comes only through knowing the Universal.<a name="FnAnchor7_86" href="#Footnote7_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a>
 If, being on the surface of the moon, we had on any one occasion seen
the earth between us and the sun, we could not have known from that
single observation that such interposition is the cause universally of
eclipses. We cannot directly by sense perceive the Universal, though
sense is the <i>principium</i> of the Universal. By multiplied
observation of sensible particulars, we can hunt out and elicit the
Universal, enunciate it clearly and separately, and make it serve for
demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor7_87" href="#Footnote7_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a>
 The Universal is precious, because it reveals the Cause or &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;, and
is therefore more precious, not merely than sensible observation, but
also than intellectual conception of the &#8005;&#964;&#953; only, where the Cause or
&#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; lies apart, and is derived from a higher genus. Respecting First
Principles or <i>Summa Genera</i>, we must speak elsewhere.<a name="FnAnchor7_88" href="#Footnote7_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>It
 is clear, therefore, that no demonstrable matter can be known, properly
 speaking, from direct perception of sense; though there are cases in
which nothing but the impossibility of direct observation drives us upon
 seeking for demonstration. Whenever we can get an adequate number of
sensible observations, we can generalize the fact; and in some instances
 we may perhaps not seek for any demonstrative knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> to
 explain it by any higher principle). If we could see the pores in glass
 and the light passing through them, we should learn through many such
observations why combustion arises on the farther side of the glass;
each of our observations would have been separate and individual, but we
 should by intellect generalize the result that all the cases fall under
 the same law.<a name="FnAnchor7_89" href="#Footnote7_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a></p>

Euclid, in the 20th Proposition of his first Book, demonstrates that any
 two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third side.
According to Proklus, the Epikureans derided the demonstration of such a
 point as absurd; and it seems that some contemporaries of Aristotle
argued in a similar way, judging by the phrase &#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;.</p></div>

The text of this and the succeeding words seems open to doubt, as well
as that of Themistius (p. 63). Waitz in his note (p. 374) explains the
meaning clearly:— “non ita quidem ut ipsa sensuum perceptio scientiam
afferat; sed ita ut quod in singulis accidere videamus, idem etiam in
omnibus accidere coniicientes universe intelligamus.”</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle next proceeds to refute, at some length, the supposition, that the <i>principia</i>
 of all syllogisms are the same. We see at once that this cannot be so,
because some syllogisms are true, others false. But, besides, though
there are indeed a few Axioms essential to the process of demonstration,
 and the same in all syllogisms, yet these are not sufficient of
themselves for demonstration. There must farther be other premisses or
matters of evidence — propositions immediately true (or established by
prior demonstrations) belonging to each branch of Science specially, as
distinguished from the others. Our demonstration relates <i>to</i> these special matters or premisses, though it is accomplished <i>out of</i> or by means of the common Axioms.<a name="FnAnchor7_90" href="#Footnote7_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a></p>

Science or scientific Cognition differs from true Opinion, and the <i>cognitum</i> from the <i>opinatum</i>,
 herein, that Science is of the Universal, and through necessary
premisses which cannot be otherwise; while Opinion relates to matters
true, yet which at the same time may possibly be false. The belief in a
proposition which is immediate (<i>i. e.</i>, undemonstrable) yet not necessary, is Opinion; it is not Science, nor is it Noûs or Intellect — the <i>principium</i> of Science or scientific Cognition. Such beliefs are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>fluctuating,
 as we see every day; we all distinguish them from other beliefs, which
we cannot conceive not to be true and which we call cognitions.<a name="FnAnchor7_91" href="#Footnote7_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
 But may there not be Opinion and Cognition respecting the same matters?
 There may be (says Aristotle) in different men, or in the same man at
different times; but not in the same man at the same time. There may
also be, respecting the same matter, true opinion in one man’s mind, and
 false opinion in the mind of another.<a name="FnAnchor7_92" href="#Footnote7_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a></p>

<p>Aristotle begins the Second Book of the Analytica Posteriora by an
enumeration and classification of Problems or Questions suitable for
investigation. The matters knowable by us may be distributed into four
classes:— </p>
<center>
<table width="75%">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&#8013;&#964;&#953;.</td>  <td> &#916;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;.</td>   <td>&#917;&#7984; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;.</td>   <td>&#932;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>1. Quod.</td>  <td>2. Cur.</td>  <td>3. An sit.</td>  <td>4. Quid sit.</td> </tr></tbody></table></center>
<p class="noind">
Under the first head come questions of Fact; under the second head,
questions of Cause or Reason; under the third, questions of Existence;
under the fourth, questions of Essence. Under the first head we enquire,
 Whether a fact or event is so or so? Whether a given subject possesses
this or that attribute, or is in this or that condition? enumerating in
the question the various supposable alternatives. Under the second head,
 we assume the first question to have been affirmatively answered, and
we proceed to enquire, What is the cause or reason for such fact, or
such conjunction of subject and attribute? Under the third head, we ask,
 Does a supposed subject exist? And if the answer be in the affirmative,
 we proceed to enquire, under the fourth head, What is the essence of
the subject?<a name="FnAnchor8_1" href="#Footnote8_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote8_1" id="Footnote8_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor8_1">1</a></span>
 Analyt. Post. II. i. p. 89, b. 23, seq. Themistius observes, p. 67,
Speng.: &#950;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#964;&#943;&#957;&#965;&#957; &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7937;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#941;&#964;&#959;&#965;, &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#941;&#964;&#959;&#965;
 &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;. Themistius has here changed Aristotle’s order, and
placed the third and fourth heads before the first and second. Compare
Schol. p. 240, b. 30; p. 241, a. 18. The Scholiast complains of the
enigmatical style of Aristotle: &#964;&#8135; &#947;&#961;&#953;&#966;&#974;&#948;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8165;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945; (p. 240,
 b. 25).</p></div>
<p>
We have here two distinct pairs of <i>Quæsita</i>: Obviously the second
head presupposes the first, and is consequent thereupon; while the
fourth also presupposes the third. But it might seem a more suitable
arrangement (as Themistius and other expositors have conceived) that the
 third and fourth heads should come first in the list, rather than the
first and second; since the third and fourth are simpler, and come
earlier in the order of philosophical exposition, while the first and
second are more complicated, and cannot be expounded philosophically
until after <span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>the
 philosophical exposition of the others. This is cleared up by adverting
 to the distinction, so often insisted on by Aristotle, between what is
first in order of cognition relatively to us (<i>nobis notiora</i>), and what is first in order of cognition by nature (<i>naturâ notiora</i>). <i>To us</i> (that is to men taken individually and in the course of actual growth) the phenomena of nature<a name="FnAnchor8_2" href="#Footnote8_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 present themselves as particulars confused and complicated in every
way, with attributes essential and accidental implicated together: we
gradually learn first to see and compare them as particulars, next to
resolve them into generalities, bundles, classes, and partially to
explain the <i>Why</i> of some by means of others. Here we start from
facts embodied in propositions, that include subjects clothed with their
 attributes. But in the <i>order of nature</i> (that is, in the order followed by those who know the <i>scibile</i>
 as a whole, and can expound it scientifically) that which comes first
is the Universal or the simple Subject abstracted from its predicates or
 accompaniments: we have to enquire, first, whether a given subject
exists; next, if it does exist, what is its real constituent essence or
definition. We thus see the reason for the order in which Aristotle has
arranged the two co-ordinate pairs of <i>Quæsita</i> or Problems,
conformable to the different processes pursued, on the one hand, by the
common intellect, growing and untrained — on the other, by the mature or
 disciplined intellect, already competent for philosophical exposition
and applying itself to new <i>incognita</i>.</p>

<p>
Mr. Poste observes upon this quadruple classification by Aristotle (p.
96):— “The two last of these are problems of Inductive, but first
principles of Deductive, Science; the one being the hypothesis, the
other the definition. The <span class="correction" title="amended from 'attibute'">attribute</span>
 as well as the subject must be defined (I. x.), so that to a certain
degree the second problem also is assumed among the principles of
Demonstration.”</p></div>
<p>
Comparing together these four <i>Quæsita</i>, it will appear that in the first and third (<i>Quod</i> and <i>An</i>), we seek to find out whether there is or is not any middle term. In the second and fourth (<i>Cur</i> and <i>Quid</i>), we already know or assume that there is a middle term; and we try to ascertain what that middle term is.<a name="FnAnchor8_3" href="#Footnote8_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The enquiry <i>Cur</i>, is in the main analogous to the enquiry <i>Quid</i>; in both cases, we aim at ascertaining what the cause or middle term is. But, in the enquiry <i>Cur</i>, what we discover is perhaps some independent fact or event, which is the cause of the event <i>quæsitum</i>; while, in the enquiry <i>Quid</i>, what we seek is the real <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>essence
 or definition of the substance — the fundamental, generating, immanent
cause of its concomitant attributes. Sometimes, however, the <i>Quid</i> and the <i>Cur</i> are only different ways of stating the same thing. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>Quid est eclipsis lunæ</i>?
 Answer: The essence of an eclipse is a privation of light from the
moon, through intervention of the earth between her and the sun. <i>Cur locum habet eclipsis lunæ</i>?
 Answer: Because the light of the sun is prevented from reaching the
moon by intervention of the earth. Here it is manifest that the answers
to the enquiries <i>Quid</i> and <i>Cur</i> are really and in substance the same fact, only stated in different phrases.<a name="FnAnchor8_4" href="#Footnote8_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>
That the <i>quæsitum</i> in all these researches is a middle term or
medium, is plain from those cases wherein the medium is perceivable by
sense; for then we neither require nor enter upon research. For example,
 if we were upon the moon, we should see the earth coming between us and
 the sun, now and in each particular case of eclipse. Accordingly, after
 many such observations, we should affirm the universal proposition,
that such intervention of the earth was the cause of eclipses; the
universal becoming known to us through induction of particular cases.<a name="FnAnchor8_5" href="#Footnote8_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The middle term, the Cause, the <i>Quid</i>, and the <i>Cur</i>, are thus all the same enquiry, in substance; though sometimes such <i>quæsitum</i>
 is the quiddity or essential nature of the thing itself (as the essence
 of a triangle is the cause or ground of its having its three angles
equal to two right angles, as well as of its other properties),
sometimes it is an extraneous fact.<a name="FnAnchor8_6" href="#Footnote8_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

But how or by what process is this <i>quæsitum</i> obtained and made clear? Is it by Demonstration or by Definition? What is Definition, and what matters admit of Definition?<a name="FnAnchor8_7" href="#Footnote8_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 Aristotle begins by treating the question dialectically; by setting out
 a series of doubts and difficulties. First, Is it possible that the
same cognition, and in the same relation, can be obtained both by
Definition and by Demonstration? No; it is not possible. It is plain
that much that is known by Demonstration cannot be known by Definition;
for we have seen that conclusions both particular and negative are
established by Demonstration (in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>the
 Third and Second figures), while every Definition is universal and
affirmative. But we may go farther and say, that even where a conclusion
 universal and affirmative is established (in the First figure) by
Demonstration, that same conclusion can never be known by Definition;
for if it could be known by Definition, it might have been known without
 Demonstration. Now we are assured, by an uncontradicted induction, that
 this is not the fact; for that which we know by Demonstration is either
 a proprium of the subject <i>per se</i>, or an accident or concomitant; but no Definition ever declares either the one or the other: it declares only the essence.<a name="FnAnchor8_8" href="#Footnote8_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>
Again, let us ask, <i>vice versâ</i>, Can everything that is declared by
 Definition, or indeed anything that is declared by Definition, be known
 also by Demonstration? Neither is this possible. One and the same <i>cognitum</i> can be known only by one process of cognition. Definitions are the <i>principia</i>
 from which Demonstration departs; and we have already shown that in
going back upon demonstrations, we must stop somewhere, and must
recognize some <i>principia</i> undemonstrable.<a name="FnAnchor8_9" href="#Footnote8_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 The Definition can never be demonstrated, for it declares only the
essence of the subject, and does not predicate anything concerning the
subject; whereas Demonstration assumes the essence to be known, and
deduces from such assumption an attribute distinct from the essence.<a name="FnAnchor8_10" href="#Footnote8_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>
Prosecuting still farther the dialectical and dubitative treatment,<a name="FnAnchor8_11" href="#Footnote8_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 Aristotle now proceeds to suggest, that the Essence (that is, the
entire Essence or Quiddity), which is declared by Definition, can never
be known by Demonstration. To suppose that it could be so known, would
be inconsistent with the conditions of the syllogistic proof used in
demonstrating. You prove by syllogism, through a middle term, some
predicate or attribute; <i>e.g.</i> because A is predicable of all B,
and B is predicable of all C, therefore A is predicable of all C. But
you cannot prove, through the middle term B, that A is the essence or
quiddity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>of
 C, unless by assuming in the premisses that B is the essence of C, and
that A is the essence of B; accordingly, that the three propositions,
AB, BC, AC, are all co-extensive and reciprocate with each other. Here,
then, you have assumed as your premisses two essential propositions, AB,
 BC, in order to prove as an essential proposition the conclusion AC.
But this is inadmissible; for your premisses require demonstration as
much as your conclusion. You have committed a <i>Petitio Principii</i>;<a name="FnAnchor8_12" href="#Footnote8_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> you have assumed in your minor premiss the very point to be demonstrated. </p>

M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, notes, p. 205:— “Il faut donc, pour conclure
par syllogisme que A est la définition essentielle de C, que A soit la
définition essentielle de B, et que B soit lui-même la définition
essentielle de C. Mais alors la définition de la chose sera dans le
moyen terme lui-même, avant d’être dans la conclusion; en effet, la
mineure: B est la définition essentielle de C, donne la définition
essentielle de C, sans qu’il soit besoin d’aller <span class="correction" title="amended from 'jusqu’ à'">jusqu’à</span> la conclusion. Donc la démonstration de l’essence ainsi entendue est absurde.”</p></div>
<p>
If you cannot obtain Definition as the conclusion of syllogistic
Demonstration, still less can you obtain it through the method of
generic and specific Division; which last method (as has been already
shown in the Analytica Priora) is not equal even to the Syllogism in
respect of usefulness and efficacy.<a name="FnAnchor8_13" href="#Footnote8_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
 You cannot in this method distinguish between propositions both true
and essential, and propositions true but not essential; you never
obtain, by asking questions according to the method of generic
subdivision, any premisses from which the conclusion follows by
necessity. Yet this is what you ought to obtain for the purpose of
Demonstration; for you are not allowed to enunciate the full actual
conclusion among the premisses, and require assent to it. Division of a
genus into its species will often give useful information, as Induction
also will;<a name="FnAnchor8_14" href="#Footnote8_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
 but neither the one nor the other will be equivalent to a
demonstration. A definition obtained only from subdivisions of a genus,
may always be challenged, like a syllogism without its middle term.</p>

<p>
Again, neither can you arrive at the definition of a given subject, by
assuming in general terms what a definition ought to be, and then
declaring a given form of words to be conformable to such assumption;
because your minor premiss must involve <span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span><i>Petitio Principii</i>.
 The same logical fault will be committed, if you take your departure
from an hypothesis in which you postulate the definition of a certain
subject, and then declare inferentially what the definition of its
contrary must be. The definition which you here assume requires proof as
 much as that which you infer from it.<a name="FnAnchor8_15" href="#Footnote8_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 Moreover, neither by this process, nor by that of generic subdivision,
can you show any reason why the parts of the definition should coalesce
into one essential whole. If they do not thus coalesce — if they be
nothing better than distinct attributes conjoined in the same subject,
like <i>musicus</i> and <i>grammaticus</i> — the real essence is not declared, and the definition is not a good one.<a name="FnAnchor8_16" href="#Footnote8_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

 pp. 1037, 1038, where Aristotle makes reference to the Analytica as
haying already treated the same subject, and professes an intention to
complete what has been begun in the Analytica; &#7952;&#966;’ &#8005;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;

<p>
After stating some other additional difficulties which seem to leave the
 work of Definition inexplicable, Aristotle relinquishes the dubitative
treatment, and looks out for some solution of the puzzle: How may it be
possible that the Definition shall become known?<a name="FnAnchor8_17" href="#Footnote8_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 He has already told us that to know the essence of a thing is the same
as to know the cause or reason of its existence; but we must first begin
 by knowing that the <i>definiendum</i> exists; for there can be no
definition of a non-entity, except a mere definition of the word, a
nominal or verbal definition. Now sometimes we know the existence of the
 subject by one or other of its accidental attributes; but this gives us
 no help towards finding the definition.<a name="FnAnchor8_18" href="#Footnote8_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
 Sometimes, however, we obtain a partial knowledge of its essence along
with the knowledge of its existence; when we know it along with some
constant antecedent, or through some constant, though derivative,
consequent. Knowing thus much, we can often discover the cause or
fundamental condition thereof, which is the essence or definition of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>the subject.<a name="FnAnchor8_19" href="#Footnote8_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 Indeed, it may happen that the constant derivative, and the fundamental
 essence on which it depends, become known both together; or, again, the
 cause or fundamental condition may perhaps not be the essence of the
subject alone, but some fact including other subjects also; and this
fact may then be stated as a middle term. Thus, in regard to eclipse of
the moon, we know the constant phenomenal fact about it, that, on a
certain recurrence of the time of full moon, the moon casts no light and
 makes no shadow. Hence we proceed to search out the cause. Is it
interposition of the earth, or conversion of the moon’s body, or
extinction of her light, &amp;c.? The new fact when shown, must appear
as a middle term, throwing into syllogistic form (in the First figure)
the cause or rational explanation of a lunar eclipse; showing not merely
 that there is an eclipse, but what an eclipse is, or what is its
definition.<a name="FnAnchor8_20" href="#Footnote8_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

Aristotle has thus shown how the Essence or Quiddity (&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;) may
become known in this class of cases. There is neither syllogism nor
demonstration thereof, yet it is declared through syllogism and
demonstration: though no demonstration thereof is possible, yet you
cannot know it without demonstration, wherever there is an extraneous
cause.<a name="FnAnchor8_21" href="#Footnote8_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p>
Mr. Poste translates an earlier passage (p. 93, a. 5) in this very
difficult chapter as follows (p. 107): “If one cause is demonstrable,
another indemonstrable cause must be the intermediate; and the proof is
in the first figure, and the conclusion affirmative and universal. In
this mode of demonstrating the essence, we prove one definition by
another, for the intermediate that proves an essence or a peculiar
predicate must itself be an essence or a peculiar predicate. Of two
definitions, then, one is proved and the other assumed; and, as we said
before, this is not a demonstration but a dialectical proof of the
essence.” Mr. Poste here translates &#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962; “dialectical
proof.” I understand it rather as meaning a syllogism, &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;
simply (Top. I. v. p. 102, b. 5), in which all that you really know is
that the predicate belongs to the subject, but in which you <i>assume</i> besides that it belongs to the subject <i>essentially</i>.
 It is not a demonstration because, in order to obtain Essence in the
conclusion, you are obliged to postulate Essence in your premiss. (See
Alexander ad Topic. I. p. 263, Br.). You have therefore postulated a
premiss which required proof as much as the conclusion.</p></div>
<p>
But the above doctrine will hold only in cases where there <i>is</i> a
distinct or extraneous cause; it will not hold in cases where there is
none. It is only in the former (as has been said) that a middle term can
 be shown; rendering it possible that Quiddity or Essence should be
declared by a valid formal syllogism, though it cannot be demonstrated
by syllogism. In the latter, where there is no distinct cause, no such
middle term can be enunciated: the Quiddity or Essence must be assumed
as an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>immediate
 or undemonstrable principium, and must be exposed or set out in the
best manner practicable as an existent reality, on Induction or on some
other authority. The arithmetician makes his first steps by assuming
both what a monad is and that there exists such a monad.<a name="FnAnchor8_22" href="#Footnote8_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>
We may distinguish three varieties of Definition. 1. Sometimes it is the
 mere explanation what a word signifies; in this sense, it has nothing
to do with essence or existence; it is a nominal definition and nothing
more.<a name="FnAnchor8_23" href="#Footnote8_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> 2. Sometimes it enunciates the Essence, cause, or reason of the <i>definitum</i>;
 this will happen where the cause is distinct or extraneous, and where
there is accordingly an intervening middle term: the definition will
then differ from a demonstration only by condensing into one enunciation
 the two premisses and the conclusion which together constitute the
demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor8_24" href="#Footnote8_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 3. Sometimes it is an immediate proposition, an indemonstrable
hypothesis, assuming Essence or Quiddity; the essence itself being
cause, and no extraneous cause — no intervening middle term — being
obtainable.<a name="FnAnchor8_25" href="#Footnote8_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>

<p>
To know or cognize is, to know the Cause; when we know the Cause, we are
 satisfied with our cognition. Now there are four Causes, or varieties
of Cause:— </p>
<p>
1. The Essence or Quiddity (Form) — &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;.</p>
<p>
2. The necessitating conditions (Matter) — &#964;&#972; &#964;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;’ &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;.</p>
<p>
3. The proximate mover or stimulator of change (Efficient) — &#7969; &#964;&#943; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#949;.</p>
<p>
4. That for the sake of which (Final Cause or End) — &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;.</p>
<p class="noind">
All these four Causes (Formal, Material, Efficient, Final) appear as
middle terms in demonstrating. We can proceed through the medium either
of Form, or of Matter, or of Efficient, or of End. The first of the four
 has already been exemplified — the demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
 by Form. The second appears in demonstrating that the angle in a
semi-circle is always a right angle; where the middle term (or matter of
 the syllogism, (&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958; &#959;&#8023;) is, that such angle is always the half of two
 right angles.<a name="FnAnchor8_26" href="#Footnote8_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
 The Efficient is the middle term, when to the question, Why did the
Persians invade Athens? it is answered that the Athenians had previously
 invaded Persia along with the Eretrians. (All are disposed to attack
those who have attacked them first; the Athenians attacked the Persians
first; <i>ergo</i>, the Persians were disposed to attack the Athenians.)
 Lastly, the Final Cause serves as middle term, when to the question,
Why does a man walk after dinner? the response is, For the purpose of
keeping up his health. In another way, the middle term here is
digestion: walking after dinner promotes digestion; digestion is the
efficient cause of health.<a name="FnAnchor8_27" href="#Footnote8_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

The Final Cause or End is prior in the order of nature, but posterior to
 the terms of the conclusion in the order of time or generation; while
the Efficient is prior in the order of time or generation. The Formal
and Material are simultaneous with the effect, neither prior nor
posterior.<a name="FnAnchor8_28" href="#Footnote8_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
 Sometimes the same fact may proceed both from a Final cause, and from a
 cause of Material Necessity; thus the light passes through our lantern
for the purpose of guiding us in the dark, but also by reason that the
particles of light are smaller than the pores in the glass. Nature
produces effects of finality, or with a view to some given end; and also
 effects by necessity, the necessity being either inherent in the
substance itself, or imposed by extraneous force. Thus a stone <i>falls</i> to the ground by necessity of the first kind, but <i>ascends</i>
 by necessity of the second kind. Among products of human intelligence
some spring wholly from design without necessity; but others arise by
accident or chance and have no final cause.<a name="FnAnchor8_29" href="#Footnote8_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a></p>

That the middle term is the Cause, is equally true in respect to <i>Entia</i>, <i>Fientia</i>, <i>Præterita</i>, and <i>Futura</i>; only that in respect to <i>Entia</i>, the middle term or Cause must be an <i>Ens</i>; in respect to <i>Fientia</i> it must be a <i>Fiens</i>; in respect to <i>Præterita</i>, a <i>Præteritum</i>; and in respect to <i>Futura</i>, a <i>Futurum</i>; that is, in each case, it must be generated at the corresponding time <span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>with the major and minor terms in the conclusion.<a name="FnAnchor8_30" href="#Footnote8_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
 What is the cause of an eclipse of the moon? The cause is, that the
earth intervenes between moon and sun; and this is true alike of
eclipses past, present, and future. Such an intervention is the essence
or definition of a lunar eclipse: the cause is therefore Formal, and
cause and effect are simultaneous, occurring at the same moment of time.
 But in the other three Causes — Material, Efficient, Final — where
phenomena are successive and not simultaneous, can we say that the
antecedent is cause and the consequent effect, time being, as seems to
us, a <i>continuum</i>? In cases like this, we can syllogize from the
consequent backward to the antecedent; but not from the antecedent
forward to the consequent. If the house has been built, we can infer
that the foundations have been laid; but, if the foundations have been
laid, we cannot infer that the house has been built.<a name="FnAnchor8_31" href="#Footnote8_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>
 There must always be an interval of time during which inference from
the antecedent will be untrue; perhaps, indeed, it may never become
true. Cause and <i>causatum</i> in these three last varieties of Cause,
do not universally and necessarily reciprocate with each other, as in
the case of the Formal cause. Though time is continuous, events or
generations are distinct points marked in a continuous line, and are not
 continuous with each other.<a name="FnAnchor8_32" href="#Footnote8_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> The number of these points that may be taken is indeed infinite; yet we must assume some of them as ultimate and immediate <i>principia</i>, in order to construct our syllogism, and provide our middle term.<a name="FnAnchor8_33" href="#Footnote8_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
 Where the middle term reciprocates and is co-extensive with the major
and the minor, in such cases we have generation of phenomena in a cycle;
 <i>e.g.</i>, after the earth has been made wet, vapour rises of
necessity: hence comes a cloud, hence water; which again falls, and the
earth again becomes wet.<a name="FnAnchor8_34" href="#Footnote8_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Finally, wherever our conclusion is not universally and necessarily true, but true only in most cases, our immediate <i>principia</i> must also be of the same character, true in most cases, but in most cases only.<a name="FnAnchor8_35" href="#Footnote8_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>

How are we to proceed in hunting out those attributes that are predicated <i>in Quid</i>,<a name="FnAnchor8_36" href="#Footnote8_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
 as belonging to the Essence of the subject? The subject being a lowest
species, we must look out for such attributes as belong to all
individuals thereof, but which belong <span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>also
 to individuals of other species under the same genus. We shall thus
find one, two, three, or more, attributes, each of which, separately
taken, belongs to various individuals lying out of the species; but the
assemblage of which, collectively taken, does not belong to any
individual lying out of the species. The Assemblage thus found is the
Essence; and the enunciation thereof is the Definition of the species.
Thus, the triad is included in the genus number; in searching for its
definition, therefore, we must not go beyond that genus, nor include any
 attributes (such as <i>ens</i>, &amp;c.) predicable of other subjects
as well as numbers. Keeping within the limits of the genus, we find that
 every triad agrees in being an odd number. But this oddness belongs to
other numbers also (pentad, heptad, &amp;c.). We therefore look out for
other attributes, and we find that every triad agrees in being a prime
number, in two distinct senses; first, that it is not measured by any
other number; secondly, that it is not compounded of any other numbers.
This last attribute belongs to no other odd number except the triad. We
have now an assemblage of attributes, which belong each of them to every
 triad, universally and necessarily, and which, taken all together,
belong <i>exclusively</i> to the triad, and therefore constitute its essence or definition. The triad is a number, odd, and prime in the two senses.<a name="FnAnchor8_37" href="#Footnote8_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> The <i>definitum</i> and the definition are here exactly co-extensive. </p>

<p>
Where the matter that we study is the entire genus, we must begin by distributing it into its lowest species; <i>e.g.</i> number into dyad, triad, &amp;c.; in like manner, taking straight line, circle, right angle, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchor8_38" href="#Footnote8_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
 We must first search out the definitions of each of these lowest
species; and these having been ascertained, we must next look above the
genus, to the Category in which it is itself comprised, whether <i>Quantum</i>, <i>Quale</i>,
 &amp;c. Having done thus much we must study the derivative attributes
or propria of the lowest species through the common generalities true
respecting the larger. We must recollect that these derivative
attributes are derived from the essence and definition of the lowest
species, the complex flowing from the simple as its <i>principium</i>: they belong <i>per se</i> only to the lowest species thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>defined; they belong to the higher genera only through those species.<a name="FnAnchor8_39" href="#Footnote8_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
 It is in this way, and not in any other, that the logical Division of
genera, according to specific differences, can be made serviceable for
investigation of essential attributes; that is, it can only be made to
demonstrate what is derivative from the essence. We have shown already
that it cannot help in demonstrating essence or Definition itself. We
learn to marshal in proper order the two constituent elements of our
definition, and to attach each specific difference to the genus to which
 it properly belongs. Thus we must not attempt to distribute the genus
animal according to the difference of having the wing divided or
undivided: many animals will fall under neither of the two heads; the
difference in question belongs to the lower genus winged animal, and
distributes the same into two species. The characteristic or specific
difference must be enunciated and postulated by itself, and must be
attached to its appropriate genus in order to form the definition. It is
 only by careful attention to the steps of legitimate logical Division
that we can make sure of including all the particulars and leaving out
none.<a name="FnAnchor8_40" href="#Footnote8_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

<p>
Some contemporaries of Aristotle, and among them Speusippus, maintained
that it was impossible either to define, or to divide logically, unless
you knew all particulars without exception. You cannot (they said) know
any one thing, except by knowing its differences from all other things;
which would imply that you knew also all these other things.<a name="FnAnchor8_41" href="#Footnote8_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> To these reasoners Aristotle replies: It is not necessary to know <i>all</i> the differences of every thing; you know a thing as soon as you know its essence, with the properties <i>per se</i>
 which are derivative therefrom. There are many differences not
belonging to the essence, but distinguishing from each other two things
having the same essence: you may know the thing, without knowing these
accidental <span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>differences.<a name="FnAnchor8_42" href="#Footnote8_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
 When you divide a genus into two species, distinguished by one
proximate specific difference, such that there cannot be any thing that
does not fall under one or other of these <i>membra condividentia</i>,
and when you have traced the subject investigated under one or other of
these members, you can always follow this road until no lower specific
difference can be found, and you have then the final essence and
definition of the subject; even though you may not know how many <i>other</i> subjects each of the two members may include.<a name="FnAnchor8_43" href="#Footnote8_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
 Thus does Aristotle reply to Speusippus, showing that it is not
necessary, for the definition of one thing, that you should know <i>all</i> other things. His reply, as in many other cases, is founded on the distinction between the Essential and the Accidental. </p>

To obtain or put together a definition through logical Division, three points are to be attended to.<a name="FnAnchor8_44" href="#Footnote8_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> Collect the predicates <i>in Quid</i>;
 range them in the proper order; make sure that there are no more, or
that you have collected all. The essential predicates are genera, to be
obtained not otherwise than by the method (dialectical) used in
concluding accidents. As regards order, you begin with the highest
genus, that which is predicable of all the others, while none of these
is predicable of it, determining in like fashion the succession of the
rest respectively. The collection will be complete, if you divide the
highest genus by an exhaustive specific difference, such that every
thing must be included in one or other of the two proximate and opposed
portions; and then taking the species thus found as your <i>dividendum</i>,
 subdivide it until no lower specific difference can be found, or you
obtain from the elements an exact equivalent to the subject.<a name="FnAnchor8_45" href="#Footnote8_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a></p>

When the investigation must proceed by getting together a group of
similar particulars, you compare them, and note what is the same in all;
 then turn to another group which are the same <i>in genere</i> yet differ <i>in specie</i>
 from the first group, and have a different point of community among
themselves. You next compare the point of community among the members of
 the first group, and that among the members of the second group. If the
 two points of community can be brought under one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>rational
 formula, that will be the definition of the subject; but if at the end
of the process, the distinct points of community are not found
resolvable into any final one, this proves that the supposed <i>definiendum</i> is not one but two or more.<a name="FnAnchor8_46" href="#Footnote8_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 For example, suppose you are investigating, What is the essence or
definition of magnanimity? You must study various magnanimous
individuals, and note what they have in common <i>quâ</i> magnanimous.<a name="FnAnchor8_47" href="#Footnote8_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 Thus, Achilles, Ajax, Alkibiades were all magnanimous. Now, that which
the three had in common was, that they could not endure to be insulted;
on that account Alkibiades went to war with his countrymen, Achilles was
 angry and stood aloof from the Greeks, Ajax slew himself. But, again,
you find two other magnanimous men, Sokrates and Lysander. These two had
 in common the quality, that they maintained an equal and unshaken
temper both in prosperity and adversity. Now when you have got thus far,
 the question to be examined is, What is the point of identity between
the temper that will not endure insult, and the temper that remains
undisturbed under all diversities of fortune? If an identity can be
found, this will be the essence or definition of magnanimity; to which
will belong equanimity as one variety, and intolerance of insult as
another. If, on the contrary, no identity can be found, you will then
have two distinct mental dispositions, without any common definition.<a name="FnAnchor8_48" href="#Footnote8_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a></p>

Aristotle says that there will be two species of magnanimity. But surely
 if the two so-called species connote nothing in common they are not
rightly called species, nor is magnanimity rightly called a genus.
Equanimity would be distinct from magnanimity; Sokrates and Lysander
would not properly be magnanimous but equanimous.</p></div>
<p>
Every definition must be an universal proposition, applicable, not
exclusively to one particular object, but to a class of greater or less
extent. The lowest species is easier to define than the higher genus;
this is one reason why we must begin with particulars, and ascend to
universals. It is in the higher genera that equivocal terms most
frequently escape detection.<a name="FnAnchor8_49" href="#Footnote8_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 When you are demonstrating, what you have first to attend to is, the
completeness of the form of syllogizing: when you are defining, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>the main requisite is to be perspicuous and intelligible; <i>i.e.</i> to avoid equivocal or metaphorical terms.<a name="FnAnchor8_50" href="#Footnote8_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
 You will best succeed in avoiding them, if you begin with the
individuals, or with examples of the lowest species, and then proceed to
 consider not their resemblances generally, but their resemblances in
certain definite ways, as in colour or figure. These more definite
resemblances you will note first; upon each you will found a formula of
separate definition; after which you will ascend to the more general
formula of less definite resemblance common to both. Thus, in regard to
the acute or sharp, you will consider the acute in sound, and in other
matters (tastes, pains, weapons, angles, &amp;c.), and you will
investigate what is the common point of identity characterizing all.
Perhaps there may be no such identity; the transfer of the term from one
 to the other may be only a metaphor: you will thus learn that no common
 definition is attainable. This is an important lesson; for as we are
forbidden to carry on a dialectical debate in metaphorical terms, much
more are we forbidden to introduce metaphorical terms in a definition.<a name="FnAnchor8_51" href="#Footnote8_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> </p>

 Analyt. Post. II. xiii. p. 97, b. 35-39. — (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#943; &#966;&#951;&#963;&#953;, &#964;&#8056;

considers it metaphorical when the term <i>acute</i> is applied both to a sound and to an angle.</p>
<p>
The treatment of this portion of the Aristotelian doctrine by Prantl
(Geschichte der Logik, vol. I. ch. iv. pp. 246, 247, 338), is
instructive. He brings out, in peculiar but forcible terms, the idea of
“notional causality” which underlies Aristotle’s Logic. “So also ist die
 Definition das Aussprechen <i>des schöpferischen Wesensbegriffes</i>.…
Soweit der schöpferische Wesensbegriff erreicht werden kann, ist durch
denselben die begriffliche Causalität erkannt; und die Einsicht in diese
 <i>primitive Ursächlichkeit</i> wird in dem Syllogismus vermittelst des
 Mittelbegriffes erreicht. Ueber den schöpferischen Wesensbegriff
hinauszugehen, ist nicht möglich.… Sobald die Definition mehr als eine
blosse Namenserklärung ist — und sie muss mehr seyn — erkennt sie den
Mittelbegriff als schöpferische Causalität.… Die ontologische Bedeutung
des Mittelbegriffes ist, dass er schöpferischer Wesensbegriff ist.”
Rassow (pp. 51, 63, &amp;c.) adopts a like metaphorical phrase:—
“Definitionem est, explicare notionem; quæ quidem est <i>creatrix rerum causa</i>.”</p></div>
<p>
To obtain and enunciate correctly the problems suitable for discussion
in each branch of science, you must have before you tables of dissection
 and logical division, and take them as guides;<a name="FnAnchor8_52" href="#Footnote8_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> beginning with the highest genus and proceeding downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
 through the successively descending scale of sub-genera and species. If
 you are studying animals, you first collect the predicates belonging to
 all animals; you then take the highest subdivision of the genus animal,
 such as bird, and you collect the predicates belonging to all birds;
and so on to the next in the descending scale. You will be able to show
cause why any of these predicates must belong to the man Sokrates, or to
 the horse Bukephalus; because it belongs to the genus animal, which
includes man and horse. Animal will be the middle term in the
demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor8_53" href="#Footnote8_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
 This example is taken from the class-terms current in vulgar speech.
But you must not confine yourself to these; you must look out for new
classes, bound together by the possession of some common attribute, yet
not usually talked of as classes, and you must see whether other
attributes can be found constantly conjoined therewith. Thus you find
that all animals having horns, have also a structure of stomach fit for
rumination, and teeth upon one jaw only. You know, therefore, what is
the cause that oxen and sheep have a structure of stomach fit for
rumination. It is because they have horns. Having-horns is the middle
term of the demonstration.<a name="FnAnchor8_54" href="#Footnote8_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
 Cases may also be found in which several objects possess no common
nature or attribute to bind them into a class, but are yet linked
together, by analogy, in different ways, to one and the same common
term.<a name="FnAnchor8_55" href="#Footnote8_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> Some predicates will be found to accompany constantly this analogy, or to belong to all the objects <i>quâ</i> analogous, just as if they had one and the same class-nature. Demonstration may be applied to these, as to the former cases.</p>

Problems must be considered to be the same, when the middle term of the
demonstration is the same for each, or when the middle term in the one
is a subordinate or corollary to that in the other. Thus, the cause of
echo, the cause of images in a mirror, the cause of the rainbow, all
come under the same general head or middle term (refraction), though
with a specific difference in each case. Again, when we investigate the
problem, Why does the Nile flow with a more powerful current in the last
 half of the (lunar) month? the reason is that the month is then more
wintry. But why <i>is</i> the month then more wintry? Because the light of the moon is then diminishing. Here are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>two middle terms, the one of which depends upon the other. The problem for investigation is therefore the same in both.<a name="FnAnchor8_56" href="#Footnote8_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a></p>

Theophrastus is said to have made collections of “<i>like problems</i>,” problems of which the solution depended upon the same middle term (Schol. p. 249, a. 11<span class="correction" title="amended from '.'">,</span> Brand.).</p></div>
<p>
Respecting <i>Causa</i> and <i>Causatum</i> question may be made whether it is necessary that when the <i>causatum</i> exists, the <i>causa</i> must exist also? The answer must be in the affirmative, if you include the cause in the definition of <i>causatum</i>.
 Thus, if you include in the definition of a lunar eclipse, the cause
thereof, viz., intervention of the earth between moon and sun — then,
whenever an eclipse occurs, such intervention must occur also. But it
must not be supposed that there is here a perfect reciprocation, and
that as the <i>causatum</i> is in this case demonstrable from the cause, so there is the like demonstration of the cause from the <i>causatum</i>. Such a demonstration is never a demonstration of &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;; it is only a demonstration of &#8005;&#964;&#953;. The <i>causatum</i>
 is not included in the definition of the cause; if you demonstrate that
 because the moon is eclipsed, therefore the earth is interposed between
 the moon and the sun, you prove the fact of the interposition, but you
learn nothing about the cause thereof. Again, in a syllogism the middle
term is the cause of the conclusion (<i>i.e.</i>, it is the reason why
the major term is predicated of the minor, which predication is the
conclusion); and in this sense the cause and <i>causatum</i> may sometimes reciprocate, so that either may be proved by means of the other. But the <i>causatum</i> here reciprocates with the <i>causa</i> only as premiss and conclusion (<i>i.e.</i>, we may know either by means of the other), not as cause and effect; the <i>causatum</i> is not cause of the <i>causa</i> as a fact and reality, as the <i>causa</i> is cause of the <i>causatum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor8_57" href="#Footnote8_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a></p>

 Themistius here speaks with a precision which is not always present to
the mind of Aristotle; for he discriminates the cause of <i>the fact</i> from the cause of the <i>affirmed fact</i> or <i>conclusion</i>.
 M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire says (Plan Général des Derniers Analytiques,
p. cxl.):— “Ainsi, la démonstration de l’effet par la cause apprend
pourquoi la chose est; la démonstration par l’effet apprend seulement
que la chose est. On sait que la terre s’interpose, mais on ne sait pas
pourquoi elle s’interpose: et ce qui le montre bien, c’est que l’idée de
 l’interposition de la terre est indispensable à la définition
essentielle de l’éclipse tandis que l’idée de l’éclipse n’a que faire
dans la définition de l’interposition. L’interposition de la terre fait
donc comprendre l’éclipse; tandis que l’éclipse ne fait pas du tout
comprendre l’interposition de la terre.”</p></div>
<p>
The question then arises, Can there be more than one cause of the same <i>causatum</i>? Is it necessary that the same effect should be produced in all cases by the same cause? In other words, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>when
 the same predicate is demonstrated to be true of two distinct minors,
may it not be demonstrated in one case by one middle term, and in the
other case by a different middle term?<a name="FnAnchor8_58" href="#Footnote8_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
 Answer: In genuine and proper scientific problems the middle term is
the rational account (definition, interpretation) of the major extreme;
this middle term therefore, or the cause, must in all cases be one and
the same. The demonstration in these cases is derived from the same
essence; it is <i>per se</i>, not <i>per accidens</i>. But there are other problems, not strictly and properly scientific, in which cause and <i>causatum</i> are connected merely <i>per accidens</i>; the demonstration being operated by a middle term which is not of the essence of the major, but is only a sign or concomitant.<a name="FnAnchor8_59" href="#Footnote8_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 According as the terms of the conclusion are related to each other, so
also will the middle term be related to both. If the conclusion be
equivocal, the middle term will be equivocal also; if the predicate in
the conclusion be in generic relation to the subject, the major also
will be in generic relation to the middle. Thus, if you are
demonstrating that one triangle is similar to another, and that one
colour is similar to another, the word similar in these two cases is not
 univocal, but equivocal; accordingly, the middle term in the
demonstration will also be equivocal. Again, if you are demonstrating
that four proportionals will also be proportionals alternately, there
will be one cause or middle term, if the subject of the conclusion be
lines; another, if the subject be numbers. Yet the middle term or cause
in both is the same, in as far as both involve a certain fact of
increment.<a name="FnAnchor8_60" href="#Footnote8_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a></p>

The major term of the syllogism will in point of extension be larger
than any particular minor, but equal or co-extensive with the sum total
of the particulars. Thus the predicate deciduous, affirmable of all
plants with broad leaves, is greater in extension than the subject
vines, also than the subject fig-trees; but it is equal in extension to
the sum total of vines and fig-trees (the other particular broad-leaved
plant). The middle also, in an universal demonstration, reciprocates
with the major, being its definition. Here the true middle or cause of
the effect that vines and fig-trees shed their leaves, is not that they
are broad-leaved plants, but rather a coagulation of sap or some such
fact.<a name="FnAnchor8_61" href="#Footnote8_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> </p>

 as the appendix and completion of his entire theory of Demonstrative

and the Analytica Posteriora, which treats of Demonstration. After

præcesserit epilogus respondens proœmio quod legitur in initio primi

<p>
Aristotle has already laid down that there can be no Demonstration without certain <i>præcognita</i> to start from; and that these <i>præcognita</i> must, in the last resort, be <i>principia</i>
 undemonstrable, immediately known, and known even more accurately than
the conclusions deduced from them. Are they then cognitions, or
cognizant habits and possessions, born along with us, and complete from
the first? This is impossible (Aristotle declares); we cannot have such
valuable and accurate cognitions from the first moments of childhood,
and yet not be at all aware of them. They must therefore be acquired;
yet how is it possible for us to acquire them?<a name="FnAnchor8_63" href="#Footnote8_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
 The fact is, that, though we do not from the first possess any such
complete and accurate cognitions as these, we have from the first an
inborn capacity or potentiality of arriving at them. And something of
the same kind belongs to all animals.<a name="FnAnchor8_64" href="#Footnote8_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
 All of them possess an apprehending and discriminating power born with
them, called Sensible Perception; but, though all possess such power,
there is this difference, that with some the act of perception dwells
for a longer or shorter time in the mind; with others it does not. In
animals with whom it does not dwell, there can be no knowledge beyond
perception, at least as to all those matters wherein perception is
evanescent; but with those that both perceive and retain perceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span> in their minds, ulterior knowledge grows up.<a name="FnAnchor8_65" href="#Footnote8_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
 There are many such retentive animals, and they differ among
themselves: with some of them reason or rational notions arise out of
the perceptions retained; with others, it is not so. First, out of
perception arises memory; next, out of memory of the same often
repeated, arises experience, since many remembrances numerically
distinct are summed up into one experience. Lastly, out of experience,
or out of the universal notion, the <i>unum et idem</i> which pervades and characterizes a multitude of particulars, when it has taken rest and root in the mind, there arises the <i>principium</i> of art and science: of science, in respect to objects existent; of art, in respect to things generable.<a name="FnAnchor8_66" href="#Footnote8_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> And thus these mental habits or acquirements neither exist in our minds determined from the beginning, nor do they spring from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>other
 acquirements of greater cognitive efficacy. They spring from sensible
perception; and we may illustrate their growth by what happens in the
panic of a terrified host, where first one runaway stops in his flight,
then a second, then a third, until at last a number docile to command is
 collected. One characteristic feature of the mind is to be capable of
this process.<a name="FnAnchor8_67" href="#Footnote8_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a></p>

A theory very analogous to this (respecting the gradual generation of
scientific universal notions in the mind out of the particulars of
sense) is stated in the Phædon of Plato, ch. xlv. p. 96, B., where
Sokrates reckons up the unsuccessful tentatives which he had made in
philosophy: &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7991;&#956;&#940; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8103; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#949;&#957;, &#7970; &#8001; &#7936;&#8052;&#961;, &#7970; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8166;&#961;, &#7970;

Boethius says, Comm. in Ciceronis Topica, p. 805:— “Plato ideas quasdam
esse ponebat, id est, species incorporeas, substantiasque constantes et
per se ab aliis naturæ ratione separatas, ut hoc ipsum <i>homo</i>, quibus participantes cæteræ res homines vel animalia fierent. At vero Aristoteles nullas putat extra esse substantias; sed <i>intellectam similitudinem plurimorum inter se differentium substantialem</i>, genus putat esse vel speciem. Nam cum homo et equus differunt rationabilitate et irrationabilitate, horum <i>intellecta similitudo</i> efficit genus. Ergo communitas quædam et plurimorum inter se differentium similitudo <i>notio</i> est; cujus notionis aliud <i>genus</i> est, aliud <i>forma</i>. Sed quoniam <i>similium intelligentia</i>
 est omnis notio, in rebus vero similibus necessaria est differentiarum
discretio, idcirco indiget notio quadam enodatione ac divisione; velut
ipse intellectus animalis sibi ipsi non sufficit,” &amp;c. </p>
<p>
The phrase <i>intellecta similitudo plurimorum</i> embodies both
Induction and Intellection in one. A like doctrine appears in the
obscure passages of Aristotle, De Animâ, III. viii. p. 429, b. 10; also
p. 432, a. 3: &#8001; &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8182;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957;. &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054;

The varieties of intellectual &#7957;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962; enumerated by Aristotle in the sixth
 book of the Nikomachean Ethica, are elucidated by Alexander in his
Comment. on the Metaphysica, (<span class="smcap">A</span>. p. 981) pp.
7, 8, Bonitz. The difference of &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#962; and &#948;&#953;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, the durable condition
 as contrasted with the transient, is noted in Categoriæ, pp. 8, 9. See
also Eth. Nikom. II. i. ii. pp 1103, 4.</p></div>

Aristotle proceeds to repeat the illustration in clearer terms — at least in terms which he thinks clearer.<a name="FnAnchor8_68" href="#Footnote8_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
 We perceive the particular individual; yet sensible perception is of
the universal in the particular (as, for example, when Kallias is before
 us, we perceive man, not the man Kallias). Now, when one of a set of
particulars dwells some time in the mind, first an universal notion
arises; next, more particulars are perceived and detained, and universal
 notions arise upon them more and more comprehensive, until at last we
reach the highest stage — the most universal and simple. From Kallias we
 rise to man; from such and such an animal, to animal <i>in genere</i>; from animal <i>in genere</i>, still higher, until we reach the highest or indivisible genus.<a name="FnAnchor8_69" href="#Footnote8_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> Hence it is plain that the first and highest <i>principia</i> can become known to us only by Induction; for it is by this process that sensible perception builds up in us the Universal.<a name="FnAnchor8_70" href="#Footnote8_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> Now among <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>those
 intellective habits or acquirements, whereby we come to apprehend
truth, there are some (Science and Noûs) that are uniformly and
unerringly true, while others (Opinion and Ratiocination) admit an
alternative of falsehood.<a name="FnAnchor8_71" href="#Footnote8_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
 Comparing Science with Noûs, the latter, and the latter only, is more
accurate and unerring than Science. But all Science implies
demonstration, and all that we know by Science is conclusions deduced by
 demonstration. We have already said that the <i>principia</i> of these
demonstrations cannot be themselves demonstrated, and therefore cannot
be known by Science; we have also said that they must be known more
accurately than the conclusions. How then can these <i>principia</i> themselves be known? They can be known only by Noûs, and from particulars. It is from the <i>principia</i> known by Noûs, with the maximum of accuracy, that Science demonstrates her conclusions. Noûs is the great <i>principium</i> of Science.<a name="FnAnchor8_72" href="#Footnote8_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a></p>

Waitz supposes that Aristotle here refers to a passage in the first book
 of the Analytica Posteriora, c. xxxi. p. 87, b. 30. M. Barthélemy St.
Hilaire thinks (p. 290) that reference is intended to an earlier
sentence of this same chapter. Neither of these suppositions seems to
suit (least of all the last) with the meaning of &#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;. But whichever he
 meant, Aristotle has not done much <i>to clear up</i> what was obscure in the antecedent statements.</p></div>

Compare, supra, Analyt. Post. I. xviii. p. 81, b. 1. Some commentators
contended that Aristotle did not mean to ascribe an inductive origin to
the common Axioms properly so called, but only to the special <i>principia</i>
 belonging to each science. Zabarella refutes this doctrine, and
maintains that the Axioms (Dignitates) are derived from Induction (Comm.
 in Analyt. Post. II. xix. p. 649, ed. Venet., 1617):— “Quum igitur
inductio non sit proprie discursus, nec ratio, jure dicit Aristoteles
principiorum notitiam non esse cum ratione, quia non ex aliis
innotescunt, sed ex seipsis dum per inductionem innotescunt. Propterea
in illa propositione, quæ in initio <span class="correction" title="amended from 'primilibri'">primi libri</span>
 legitur, sub doctrina discursiva cognitio principiorum non
comprehenditur, quia non est dianoëtica. Hoc, quod modo diximus, si
nonnulli advertissent, fortasse non negassent principia communia, quæ
dicuntur Dignitates, inductione cognosci. Dixerunt enim Aristotelem hic
de principiis loquentem sola principia propria considerasse, quæ cum non
 proprio lumine cognoscantur, inductione innotescunt; at Dignitates
(inquiunt) proprio lumine ab intellectu nostro cognoscuntur per solam
terminorum intelligentiam, ut quod omne totum majus est suâ parte; hoc
enim non magis est evidens sensui in particulari, quam intellectui in
universali, proinde inductione non eget. Sed hanc sententiam hic
Averroes refutat, dicens hæc quoque inductione cognosci, sed non
animadverti nobis tempus hujus inductionis; id enim omnino confitendum
est, omnem intellectualem doctrinam à sensu originem ducere, et nihil
esse in intellectu quod prius in sensu non fuerit, ut ubique asserit
Aristoteles.”</p>
<p>
To the same purpose Zabarella expresses himself in an earlier portion of
 his Commentary on the Analyt. Post., where he lays it down that the
truth of the proposition, Every whole is greater than its part, is known
 from antecedent knowledge of particulars by way of Induction. Compare
the Scholion of Philoponus, ad Analyt. Post. p. 225, a. 32, Brand.,
where the same is said about the Axiom, Things equal to the same are
equal to each other.</p></div>

<p>
The manner in which Aristotle here describes how the <i>principia</i> of Syllogism become known to the mind deserves particular attention. The march up to <i>principia</i> is not only different from, but the reverse of, the march down from <i>principia</i>; like the athlete who runs first to the end of the stadium, and then back.<a name="FnAnchor8_73" href="#Footnote8_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
 Generalizing or universalizing is an acquired intellectual habit or
permanent endowment; growing out of numerous particular acts or
judgments of sense, remembered, compared, and coalescing into one mental
 group through associating resemblance. As the ethical, moral, practical
 habits, are acquirements growing out of a repetition of particular
acts, so also the intellectual, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>theorizing
 habits are mental results generated by a multitude of particular
judgments of sense, retained and compared, so as to imprint upon the
mind a lasting stamp of some identity common to all. The Universal (<i>notius naturâ</i>) is thus generated in the mind by a process of Induction out of particulars which are <i>notiora nobis</i>; the potentiality of this process, together with sense and memory, is all that is innate or connatural.</p>

<p>
The <i>principia</i>, from which the conclusions of Syllogism are
deduced, being thus obtained by Induction, are, in Aristotle's view,
appreciated by, or correlated with, the infallible and unerring Noûs or
Intellect.<a name="FnAnchor8_74" href="#Footnote8_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a>
 He conceives repeated and uncontradicted Induction as carrying with it
the maximum of certainty and necessity: the syllogistic deductions
constituting Science he regards as also certain; but their certainty is
only derivative, and the <i>principia</i> from which they flow he ranks still higher, as being still more certain.<a name="FnAnchor8_75" href="#Footnote8_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> Both the one and the other he pointedly contrasts with Opinion and Calculation, which he declares to be liable to error. </p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote8_74" id="Footnote8_74"></a><a href="#FnAnchor8_74">74</a></span> The passages respecting &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; or <i>principia</i>, in the Nikomachean Ethica (especially Books I. and VI.), are instructive as to Aristotle’s views. The <i>principia</i>
 are universal notions and propositions, not starting up ready-made nor
as original promptings of the intellect, but gradually built up out of
the particulars of sense and Induction, and repeated particular acts.
They are judged and sanctioned by &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962; or Intellect, but it requires
much care to define them well. They belong to the &#8005;&#964;&#953;, while
demonstration belongs to the &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;. Eth. Nik. I. vii. p. 1098, a. 33:

Aristotle had inherited from Plato this doctrine of an infallible Noûs
or Intellect, enjoying complete immunity from error. But, instead of
connecting it (as Plato had done) with reminiscences of an anterior life
 among the Ideas, he assigned to it a position as terminus and correlate
 to the process of Induction.<a name="FnAnchor8_76" href="#Footnote8_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> The like postulate and pretension passed afterwards to the Stoics, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>various
 other philosophical sects: they could not be satisfied without finding
infallibility somewhere. It was against this pretension that the
Academics and Sceptics entered their protest; contending, on grounds
sometimes sophistical but often very forcible, that it was impossible to
 escape from the region of fallibility, and that no criterion of truth,
at once universal and imperative, could be set up.</p>

where he amplifies the last chapter, and explains &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962; as the
generalizing or universalizing aptitude of the soul, growing up
gradually out of the particulars furnished by Sense and Induction.</p></div>
<p>
It is to be regretted that Aristotle should have contented himself with
proclaiming this Inductive process as an ideal, culminating in the
infallible Noûs; and that he should only have superficially noticed
those conditions under which it must be conducted in reality, in order
to avoid erroneous or uncertified results. This is a deficiency however
which has remained unsupplied until the present century.<a name="FnAnchor8_77" href="#Footnote8_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a></p>

 Sir W. Hamilton, Lectures on Logic, Vol. III. Lect. xix. p. 380, says:—
 “In regard to simple syllogisms, it was an original dogma of the
Platonic School, and an early dogma of the Peripatetic, that philosophy
(science strictly so-called) was only conversant with, and was
exclusively contained in, universals; and the doctrine of Aristotle,
which taught that all our general knowledge is only an induction from an
 observation of particulars, was too easily forgotten or perverted by
his followers. It thus obtained almost the force of an acknowledged
principle, that everything to be known must be known under some general
form or notion. Hence the exaggerated importance attributed to
definition and deductions, it not being considered that we only take out
 of a general notion what we had previously placed therein, and that the
 amplification of our knowledge is not to be sought for from above but
from below, — not from speculation about abstract generalities, but from
 the observation of concrete particulars. But however erroneous and
irrational, the persuasion had its day and influence, and it perhaps
determined, as one of its effects, the total neglect of one half, and
that not the least important half, of the reasoning process. For while
men thought only of looking upward to the more extensive notions, as the
 only objects and the only media of science, they took little heed of
the more comprehensive notions, and absolutely contemned individuals, as
 objects which could neither be scientifically known in themselves nor
supply the conditions of scientifically knowing aught besides. The Logic
 of Comprehension and of Induction was therefore neglected or ignored, —
 the Logic of Extension and Deduction exclusively cultivated, as alone
affording the rules by which we might evolve higher notions into their
subordinate concepts.”</p>
<p>
(Hamilton, in this passage, considers the Logic of <i>Induction</i> to be the same as the Logic of <i>Comprehension</i>.)</p></div>

    <h2><a name="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><span class="smcap">TOPICA</span>.</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>I.</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In treating of the Analytica Posteriora I have already adverted,
      in the way of contrast, to the Topica; and, in now approaching the
      latter work, I must again bring the same contrast before the mind
      of the reader. </p>
    <p> The treatise called Topica (including that which bears the
      separate title De Sophisticis Elenchis, but which is properly its
      Ninth or last Book, winding up with a brief but memorable
      recapitulation of the Analytica and Topica considered as one
      scheme) is of considerable length, longer than the Prior and
      Posterior Analytics taken together. It contains both a theory and
      precepts of Dialectic; also, an analysis of the process called by
      Aristotle Sophistical Refutation, with advice how to resist or
      neutralize it.</p>
    <p> All through the works of Aristotle, there is nothing which he so
      directly and emphatically asserts to be his own original
      performance, as the design and execution of the Topica: <i>i.e.</i>,
      the deduction of Dialectic and Sophistic from the general theory
      of Syllogism. He had to begin from the beginning, without any
      model to copy or any predecessor to build upon: and in every sort
      of work, he observes justly, the first or initial stages are the
      hardest.<a name="FnAnchor9_1" href="#Footnote9_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
      In regard to Rhetoric much had been done before him; there were
      not only masters who taught it, but writers who theorized well or
      ill, and laid down precepts about it; so that, in his treatise on
      that subject, he had only to enlarge and improve upon pre-existing
      suggestions. But in regard to Dialectic as he conceives it — in
      its contrast with Demonstration and Science on the one hand, and
      in its analogy or kinship with Rhetoric on the other — nothing
      whatever had been done. There were, indeed, teachers of
      contentious dialogue, as well as of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>Rhetoric;<a name="FnAnchor9_2" href="#Footnote9_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      but these teachers could do nothing better than recommend to their
      students dialogues or orations ready made, to be learnt by heart.
      Such a mode of teaching (he says), though speedy, was altogether
      unsystematic. The student acquired no knowledge of the art, being
      furnished only with specimens of art-results. It was as if a
      master, professing to communicate the art of making the feet
      comfortable, taught nothing about leather-cutting or shoe-making,
      but furnished his pupils with different varieties of ready-made
      shoes; thus supplying what they wanted for the protection of the
      feet, but not imparting to them any power of providing such
      protection for themselves.<a name="FnAnchor9_3" href="#Footnote9_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> “In regard to
      the process of syllogizing (says Aristotle, including both
      Analytic and Dialectic) I found positively nothing said before me:
      I had to work it out for myself by long and laborious research.”<a name="FnAnchor9_4" href="#Footnote9_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> This is one of the few passages, throughout the philosopher’s
      varied and multitudinous works, in which he alludes to his own
      speciality of method. It is all the more interesting on that
      account. If we turn back to Sokrates and Plato, we shall
      understand better what the innovation operated by Aristotle was;
      what the position of Dialectic had been before his time, and what
      it became afterwards.</p>
    <p> In the minds of Sokrates and Plato, the great antithesis was
      between Dialectic and Rhetoric — interchange of short question and
      answer before a select audience, as contrasted with long
      continuous speech addressed to a miscellaneous crowd with known
      established sentiments and opinions, in the view of persuading
      them on some given interesting point requiring decision. In such
      Dialectic Sokrates was a consummate master; passing most of his
      long life in the market-place and palæstra, and courting
      disputation with every one. He made formal profession of
      ignorance, disclaimed all power of teaching, wrote nothing at all,
      and applied himself almost exclusively to the cross-examining <i>Elenchus</i>
      by which he exposed and humiliated the ablest men not less than
      the vulgar. Plato, along with the other companions of Sokrates,
      imbibed the Dialectic of his master, and gave perpetuity to it in
      those inimitable dialogues which are still <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>preserved to us from
      his pen. He composed nothing but dialogues; thus giving expression
      to his own thoughts only under borrowed names, and introducing
      that of Sokrates very generally as chief spokesman. But Plato,
      though in some dialogues he puts into the mouth of his spokesman
      the genuine Sokratic disclaimer of all power and all purpose of
      teaching, yet does not do this in all. He sometimes assumes the
      didactic function; though he still adheres to the form of
      dialogue, even when it has become inconvenient and unsuitable. In
      the Platonic Republic Sokrates is made to alternate his own
      peculiar vein of cross-examination with a vein of dogmatic
      exposition not his own; but both one and the other in the same
      style of short question and answer. In the Leges becomes still
      more manifest the inconvenience of combining the substance of
      dogmatic exposition with the form of dialogue: the same remark may
      also be made about the Sophistes and Politicus; in which two
      dialogues, moreover, the didactic process is exhibited purely and
      exclusively as a logical partition, systematically conducted, of a
      genus into its component species. Long-continued speech, always
      depreciated by Plato in its rhetorical manifestations, is foreign
      to his genius even for purposes of philosophy: the very lecture on
      cosmogony which he assigns to Timæus, and the mythical narrative
      (unfinished) delivered by Kritias, are brought into something like
      the form of dialogue by a prefatory colloquy specially adapted for
      that end.</p>
    <p> It thus appears that, while in Sokrates the dialectic process is
      exhibited in its maximum of perfection, but disconnected
      altogether from the didactic, which is left unnoticed, — in Plato
      the didactic process is recognized and postulated, but is
      nevertheless confounded with or absorbed into the dialectic, and
      admitted only as one particular, ulterior, phase and manifestation
      of it. At the same time, while both Sokrates and Plato bring out
      forcibly the side of antithesis between Rhetoric and Dialectic,
      they omit entirely to notice the side of analogy or parallelism
      between them. On both these points Aristotle has corrected the
      confusion, and improved upon the discrimination, of his two
      predecessors. He has pointedly distinguished the dialectic process
      from the didactic; and he has gone a step farther, furnishing a
      separate theory and precepts both for the one and for the other.
      Again, he has indicated the important feature of analogy between
      Dialectic and Rhetoric, in which same feature both of them
      contrast with Didactic — the point not seized either by Sokrates
      or by Plato.</p>
    <p> Plato, in his Sokratic dialogues or dialogues of Search, has <span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>given

      admirable illustrative specimens of that which Sokrates understood
      and practised orally as Dialectic. Aristotle, in his Topica, has
      in his usual vein of philosophy theorized on this practice as an
      art. He had himself composed dialogues, which seem as far as we
      can judge from indirect and fragmentary evidence, to have been
      Ciceronian or rhetorical colloquies — a long pleading <i>pro</i>
      followed by a long pleading <i>con</i>, rather than examples of
      Sokratic brachylogy and cross-examination. But his theory given in
      the Topica applies to genuine Sokratic fencing, not to the
      Ciceronian alternation of set speeches. He disallows the
      conception of Plato, that Dialectic is a process including not
      merely dispute but all full and efficacious employment of general
      terms and ideas for purposes of teaching: he treats this latter as
      a province by itself, under the head of Analytic: and devotes the
      Topica to the explanation of argumentative debate, pure and
      simple. He takes his departure from the Syllogism, as the type of
      deductive reasoning generally; the conditions under which
      syllogistic reasoning is valid and legitimate, having been already
      explained in his treatise called Analytica Priora. So obtained,
      and regulated by those conditions, the Syllogism may be applied to
      one or other of two distinct and independent purposes:— (1) To
      Demonstration or Scientific Teaching, which we have had before us
      in the last two chapters, commenting on the Analytica Posteriora;
      (2) To Dialectic, or Argumentative Debate, which we are now about
      to enter on in the Topica.</p>
    <p> The Dialectic Syllogism, explained in the Topica, has some
      points in common with the Demonstrative Syllogism, treated in the
      Analytica Posteriora. In both, the formal conditions are the same,
      and the conclusions will certainly be true, if the premisses are
      true; in both, the axioms of deductive reasoning are assumed,
      namely, the maxims of Contradiction and Excluded Middle. But, in
      regard to the subject-matter, the differences between them are
      important. The Demonstrative Syllogism applies only to a small
      number of select sciences, each having special <i>principia</i>
      of its own, or primary, undemonstrable truths, obtained in the
      first instance by induction from particulars. The premisses being
      thus incontrovertibly certain, the conclusions deduced are not
      less certain; there is no necessary place for conflicting
      arguments or counter-syllogisms, although in particular cases
      paralogisms may be committed, and erroneous propositions or majors
      for syllogism may be assumed. On the contrary, the Dialectic
      Syllogism applies to all matters without exception; the premisses
      on which it proceeds are neither <span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>obtained by
      induction, nor incontrovertibly certain, but are borrowed from
      some one among the varieties of accredited or authoritative
      opinion. They may be opinions held by the multitude of any
      particular country, or by an intelligent majority, or by a
      particular school of philosophers or wise individuals, or from
      transmission as a current proverb or dictum of some ancient poet
      or seer. From any one of these sources the dialectician may borrow
      premisses for syllogizing. But it often happens that the premisses
      which they supply are disparate, or in direct contradiction to
      each other; and none of them is entitled to be considered as final
      or peremptory against the rest. Accordingly, it is an essential
      feature of Dialectic as well as of Rhetoric that they furnish
      means of establishing conclusions contrary or contradictory, by
      syllogisms equally legitimate.<a name="FnAnchor9_5" href="#Footnote9_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The dialectic
      procedure is from its beginning intrinsically contentious,
      implying a debate between two persons, one of whom sets up a
      thesis to defend, while the other impugns it by interrogation: the
      assailant has gained his point, if he can reduce the defendant to
      the necessity of contradicting himself; while the defendant on his
      side has to avoid giving any responses which may drive him to the
      necessity of such contradiction. </p>

    <p> Aristotle takes great pains to enforce the separation both of
      Dialectic and Rhetoric from Science or Instruction with its
      purpose of teaching or learning. He disapproves of those
      (seemingly intending Plato) who seek to confound the two.
      Dialectic and Rhetoric (he says) have for their province words and
      discourse, not facts or things: they are not scientific or
      didactic processes, but powers or accomplishments of discourse;
      and whoever tries to convert them into means of teaching or
      learning particular subjects, abolishes their characteristic
      feature and restricts their universality of application.<a name="FnAnchor9_6" href="#Footnote9_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
      Both of them deal not with scientific facts, but with the sum
      total of accredited opinions, though each for its own purpose:
      both of them lay hold of any one among the incoherent aggregate of
      accepted generalities, suitable for the occasion; the Dialectician
      trying <span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>to

      force his opponent into an inconsistency, the Rhetor trying to
      persuade his auditors into a favourable decision. Neither the one
      nor the other goes deeper than opinion for his premisses, nor
      concerns himself about establishing by induction primary or
      special <i>principia</i>, such as may serve for a basis of
      demonstration.</p>

    <p> In every society there are various floating opinions and
      beliefs, each carrying with it a certain measure of authority,
      often inconsistent with each other, not the same in different
      societies, nor always the same even in the same society. Each
      youthful citizen, as he grows to manhood, imbibes these opinions
      and beliefs insensibly and without special or professional
      teaching.<a name="FnAnchor9_7" href="#Footnote9_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The stock of opinions thus transmitted
      would not be identical even at Athens and Sparta: the difference
      would be still greater, if we compared Athens with Rome,
      Alexandria, or Jerusalem. Such opinions all carry with them more
      or less of authority, and it is from them that the reasonings of
      common life, among unscientific men, are supplied. The practice of
      dialectical discussion, prevalent in Athens during and before the
      time of Aristotle, was only a more elaborate, improved, and
      ingenious exhibition of this common talk; proceeding on the same
      premisses, but bringing them together from a greater variety of
      sources, handling them more cleverly, and having for its purpose
      to convict an opponent of inconsistency. The dialecticians dwelt
      exclusively in the region of these received opinions; and the
      purpose of their debates was to prove inconsistency, or to repel
      the proof of inconsistency, between one opinion and another.</p>

    <p> This dialectic debate, which Aristotle found current at Athens,
      he tries in the Topica to define and reduce to system. The
      dialectician must employ Syllogism; and we are first taught to
      distinguish the Syllogism that he employs from others. The
      Dialectic syllogism is discriminated on one side from the
      Demonstrative, on the other from the Eristic (or litigious); also
      from the scientific Paralogism or Pseudographeme. This
      discrimination is founded on the nature of the evidence belonging
      to the premisses. The Demonstrative syllogism (which we have
      already gone through in the Analytica Posteriora) has premisses
      noway dependent upon opinion: it deduces conclusions from true
      first principles, obtained by Induction in each science, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>different

      in each different science. The Dialectic syllogism does not aspire
      to any such evidence, but borrows its premisses from Opinion of
      some sort; accredited either by numbers, or by wise individuals,
      or by some other authoritative holding. As this evidence is very
      inferior to that of the demonstrative syllogism, so again it is
      superior to that of the third variety — the Eristic syllogism. In
      this third variety,<a name="FnAnchor9_8" href="#Footnote9_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> the premisses do not rest upon any
      real opinion, but only on a fallacious appearance or simulation of
      opinion; insomuch that they are at once detected as false, by any
      person even of moderate understanding; whereas (according to
      Aristotle) no real opinion ever carries with it such a merely
      superficial semblance, or is ever so obviously and palpably false.
      A syllogism is called Eristic also when it is faulty in form,
      though its premisses may be borrowed from real opinion, or when it
      is both faulty in form and false in the matter of the premisses.
      Still a fourth variety of syllogism is the scientific Paralogism:
      where the premisses are not borrowed from any opinion, real or
      simulated, but belong properly to the particular science in which
      they are employed, yet nevertheless are false or erroneous.<a name="FnAnchor9_9" href="#Footnote9_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

    <p> Upon the classification of syllogisms here set forth by
      Aristotle, we may remark that the distinction between the
      Demonstrative and the Dialectic is true and important; but that
      between the Dialectic and the Eristic is faint and unimportant;
      the class called Eristic syllogisms being apparently introduced
      merely to create a difference, real or supposed, between the
      Dialectician and the Sophist, and thus to serve as a prelude to
      the last book of this treatise, entitled Sophistici Elenchi. The
      class-title Eristic (or litigious) is founded upon a supposition
      of dishonest intentions on the part of the disputant; but it is
      unphilosophical to make this the foundation of a class, and to
      rank the same syllogism in the class, or out of it, according as
      the intentions of the disputant who employs it are honest or
      dishonest. Besides, a portion of Aristotle’s definition tells us
      that the Eristic syllogism is one of which the premisses can
      impose upon no one; being such that a very ordinary man can at
      once detect their falsity. The dishonest disputant, surely, would
      argue to little purpose, if he intentionally employed such
      premisses as these. Lastly, according to another portion of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>Aristotle’s

      definition, every syllogism faulty in form, or yielding no
      legitimate conclusion at all, will fall under the class Eristic,
      and this he himself in another place explicitly states;<a name="FnAnchor9_10" href="#Footnote9_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
      which would imply that the bad syllogism must always emanate from
      litigious or dishonest intentions. But in defining the
      Pseudographeme, immediately afterwards, Aristotle does not imply
      that the false scientific premiss affords presumption of litigious
      disposition on the part of those who advance it; nor does there
      seem any greater propriety in throwing all bad dialectic
      syllogisms under the general head of Eristic. </p>

    <p> The dialectician, then, will carry on debate only by means of
      premisses sustained by real opinion; which not only always carry
      some authority, but are assumed as being never obviously
      fallacious; though often inconsistent with each other, and
      admitting of argumentation <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>. These are
      what Aristotle calls <i>Endoxa</i>; opposed to <i>Adoxa</i>, or
      propositions which are discountenanced, or at least not
      countenanced, by opinion, and to <i>Paradoxa</i> (a peculiar
      variety of <i>Adoxa</i>),<a name="FnAnchor9_11" href="#Footnote9_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> or
      propositions which, though having ingenious arguments in their
      favour, yet are adverse to some proclaimed and wide-spread
      opinions, and thus have the predominant authority of opinion
      against them. </p>

    <p> Of these three words, <i>Paradox</i> is the only one that has
      obtained a footing in modern languages, thanks to Cicero and the
      Latin authors. If the word <i>Endox</i> had obtained the like
      footing, we should be able to keep more closely to the thought and
      views of Aristotle. As it is, we are obliged to translate the
      Greek <i>Endoxon</i> as Probable, and <i>Adoxon</i> as
      Improbable:<a name="FnAnchor9_12" href="#Footnote9_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> which, though not incorrect, is
      neither suitable nor exactly coincident. Probable corresponds more
      nearly to what Aristotle (both in this treatise and in the
      Analytica) announces sometimes as &#964;&#8056; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973; — that which
      happens in most cases but not in all, as distinguished from the
      universal and necessary on one side, and from the purely casual on
      the other;<a name="FnAnchor9_13" href="#Footnote9_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> sometimes, also, as &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984;&#954;&#972;&#962; or &#964;&#8056;
      &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;. Now this is a different idea from (though it has a point
      of analogy with) the <i>Endoxon</i>: which is not necessarily
      true even in part, but may be wholly untrue; which always has some
      considerations against it, though there <span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>may be more in its
      favour; and which, lastly, may be different, or even opposite, in
      different ages and different states of society. When Josephus
      distinguished himself as a disputant in the schools of Jerusalem
      on points of law and custom,<a name="FnAnchor9_14" href="#Footnote9_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> his
      arguments must have been chiefly borrowed from the <i>Endoxa</i>
      or prevalent opinions of the time and place; but these must have
      differed widely from the <i>Endoxa</i> found and argued upon by
      the contemporaries of Aristotle at Athens. The <i>Endoxon</i> may
      indeed be rightly called probable, because, whenever a proposition
      is fortified by a certain body of opinion, Aristotle admits a
      certain presumption (greater or less) that it is true. But such
      probability is not essential to the <i>Endoxon</i>: it is only an
      accident or accompaniment (to use the Aristotelian phrase), and by
      no means an universal accompaniment. The essential feature of the
      <i>Endoxon</i> is, that it has acquired a certain amount of
      recognition among the mass of opinions and beliefs floating and
      carrying authority at the actual time and place. The English word
      whereby it is translated ought to express this idea, and nothing
      more; just as the correlative word Paradox does express its
      implication, approached from the other side. Unfortunately, in the
      absence of Endox, we have no good word for the purpose.</p>

    </div>
    <p> It is within this wide field of floating opinions that
      dialectical debate and rhetorical pleading are carried on.
      Dialectic supposes a questioner or assailant, and a respondent or
      defendant. The respondent selects and proclaims a problem or
      thesis, which he undertakes to maintain: the assailant puts to him
      successive questions, with the view of obtaining concessions which
      may serve as premisses for a counter-syllogism, of which the
      conclusion is contradictory or contrary to the thesis itself, or
      to some other antecedent premiss which the respondent has already
      conceded. It is the business of the respondent to avoid making any
      answers which may serve as premisses for such a counter-syllogism.
      If he succeeds in this, so as not to become implicated in any
      contradiction with himself, he has baffled his assailant, and
      gained the victory. There are, however, certain rules and
      conditions, binding on both parties, under which the debate must
      be carried on. It is the purpose of the Topica to indicate these
      rules; and, in accordance therewith, to advise both parties as to
      the effective conduct of their respective cases—as to the best
      thrusts and the best mode of parrying. The assailant is supplied
      with a classified catalogue of materials for questions, and with
      indications of the weak points which he is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>to look out for in
      any new subject which may turn up for debate. He is farther
      instructed how to shape, marshal, and disguise his questions, in
      such a way that the respondent may least be able to foresee their
      ultimate bearing. The respondent, on his side, is told what he
      ought to look forward to and guard against. Such is the scope of
      the present treatise; the entire process being considered in the
      large and comprehensive spirit customary with Aristotle, and
      distributed according to the Aristotelian terminology and
      classification.</p>
    <p> It is plain that neither the direct purpose of the debaters, nor
      the usual result of the debate, is to prove truth or to disprove
      falsehood. Such may indeed be the result occasionally; but the
      only certain result is, that an inconsistency is exposed in the
      respondent’s manner of defending his thesis, or that the assailant
      fails in his purpose of showing up such inconsistency. Whichever
      way the debate may turn, no certain inference can be drawn as to
      the thesis itself: not merely as to whether it is true or false,
      but even as to whether it consists or does not consist with other
      branches of received opinions. Such being the case, what is the
      use or value of dialectic debate, or of a methodized procedure for
      conducting it? Aristotle answers this question, telling us that it
      is useful for three purposes.<a name="FnAnchor9_15" href="#Footnote9_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> First, the
      debate is a valuable and stimulating mental exercise; and, if a
      methodized procedure be laid down, both parties will be able to
      conduct it more easily as well as more efficaciously. Secondly, it
      is useful for our intercourse with the multitude;<a name="FnAnchor9_16" href="#Footnote9_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
      for the procedure directs us to note and remember the opinions of
      the multitude, and such knowledge will facilitate our intercourse
      with them: we shall converse with them out of their own opinions,
      which we may thus be able beneficially to modify. Thirdly,
      dialectic debate has an useful though indirect bearing even upon
      the processes of science and philosophy, and upon the truths
      thereby acquired.<a name="FnAnchor9_17" href="#Footnote9_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> For it accustoms us to study the
      difficulties on both sides of every question, and thus assists us
      in detecting and discriminating truth and falsehood. Moreover,
      apart from this mode of usefulness, it opens a new road to the
      scrutiny of the first <i>principia</i> of each separate science.
      These <i>principia</i> can never be scrutinized through the
      truths of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>the

      science itself, which presuppose them and are deduced from them.
      To investigate and verify them, is the appropriate task of First
      Philosophy. But Dialectic also, carrying investigation as it does
      everywhere, and familiarized with the received opinions on both
      sides of every subject, suggests many points of importance in
      regard to these <i>principia</i>. </p>

    <p> The three heads just enumerated illustrate the discriminating
      care of Aristotle. The point of the first head is brought out
      often in the Platonic Dialogues of Search: the stimulus brought to
      bear in awakening dormant intellectual power, and in dissipating
      that false persuasion of knowledge which is the general infirmity
      of mankind, is frequently declared by Plato to be the most
      difficult, but the indispensable, operation of the teacher upon
      his pupil. Under the third head, Aristotle puts this point more
      justly than Plato, not as a portion of teaching, nor as
      superseding direct teaching, but as a preliminary thereunto; and
      it is a habit of his own to prefix this antecedent survey of
      doubts and difficulties on both sides, as a means of sharpening
      our insight into the dogmatic exposition which immediately
      follows.</p>
    <p> Under the second head, we find exhibited another characteristic
      feature of Aristotle’s mind — the value which he sets upon a
      copious acquaintance with received opinions, whether correct or
      erroneous. The philosophers of his day no longer talked publicly
      in the market-place and with every one indiscriminately, as
      Sokrates had done: scientific study, and the habit of written
      compositions naturally conducted them into a life apart, among
      select companions. Aristotle here indicates that such estrangement
      from the multitude lessened their means of acting beneficially on
      the multitude, and in the way of counteraction he prescribes
      dialectical exercise. His own large and many-sided observation,
      extending to the most vulgar phenomena, is visible throughout his
      works, and we know that he drew up a collection of current
      proverbs.<a name="FnAnchor9_18" href="#Footnote9_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>
    <p> </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote9_18" id="Footnote9_18"></a><a href="#FnAnchor9_18">18</a></span>
        Diog. Laert. v. 26. Kephisodorus, the disciple of Isokrates, in
        defending his master, depreciated this Aristotelian collection;
        see in Athenæus II. lvi., comparing Schweighäuser’s
        Animadversiones I. p. 406.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Again, what we read under the third head shows that, while
      Aristotle everywhere declares Demonstration and teaching to be a
      process apart from Dialectic, he at the same time recognizes the
      legitimate function of the latter, for testing and verifying the <i>principia</i>
      of Demonstration:<a name="FnAnchor9_19" href="#Footnote9_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> which <i>principia</i> cannot be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>reached

      by Demonstration itself, since every demonstration presupposes
      them. He does not mean that these <i>principia</i> can be proved
      by Dialectic, for Dialectic does not prove any thing; but it is
      necessary as a test or scrutinizing process to assure us that all
      the objections capable of being offered against them can be met by
      sufficient replies. In respect of universal competence and
      applicability, Dialectic is the counterpart, or rather the
      tentative companion and adjunct, of what Aristotle calls First
      Philosophy or Ontology; to which last he assigns the cognizance of
      <i>principia</i>, as we shall see when we treat of the Metaphysica.<a name="FnAnchor9_20" href="#Footnote9_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
      Dialectic (he repeats more than once) is not a definite science or
      body of doctrine, but, like rhetoric or medicine, a practical art
      or ability of dealing with the ever varying situations of the
      dialogue; of imagining and enunciating the question proper for
      attack, or the answer proper for defence, as the case may be. As
      in the other arts, its resources are not unlimited. Nor can the
      dialectician, any more than the rhetor or the physician, always
      guarantee success. Each of them has an end to be accomplished; and
      if he employs for its accomplishment the best means that the
      situation permits, he must be considered a master of his own art
      and procedure.<a name="FnAnchor9_21" href="#Footnote9_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> To detect truth, and to detect what
      is like truth, belong (in Aristotle’s judgment) to the same mental
      capacity. Mankind have a natural tendency towards truth, and the
      common opinions therefore are, in most cases, coincident with
      truth. Accordingly, the man who divines well in regard to
      verisimilitude, will usually divine well in regard to truth.<a name="FnAnchor9_22" href="#Footnote9_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

    <p> The subject-matter of dialectic debate, speaking generally,
      consists of Propositions and Problems, to be propounded as
      questions by the assailant and to be admitted or disallowed by the
      defendant. They will relate either to <i>Expetenda</i> and <i>Fugienda</i>,
      or they must bear, at least indirectly, upon some point of
      scientific truth or observed cognition.<a name="FnAnchor9_23" href="#Footnote9_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> They will be
      either ethical, physical, or logical; class-terms which Aristotle
      declines to define, contenting himself with giving an example to
      illustrate each of them, while adding that the student should
      collect other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>similar examples, and gradually
      familiarize himself with the full meaning of the general term,
      through such inductive comparison of particulars.<a name="FnAnchor9_24" href="#Footnote9_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

        &#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;

      <p> This illustrates Aristotle’s view of the process of Induction
        and its results; the acquisition of the import of a general
        term, through comparison of numerous particulars comprehended
        under it.</p>
      <p> The term <i>logical</i> does not exactly correspond with
        Aristotle’s &#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;, but on the present occasion no better term
        presents itself.</p>
    </div>
    <p> But it is not every problem coming under one of these three
      heads that is fit for dialectic debate. If a man propounds as
      subject for debate, Whether we ought to honour the gods or to love
      our parents, he deserves punishment instead of refutation: if he
      selects the question, Whether snow is white or not, he must be
      supposed deficient in perceptive power.<a name="FnAnchor9_25" href="#Footnote9_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> What all
      persons unanimously believe, is unsuitable:<a name="FnAnchor9_26" href="#Footnote9_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> what no one
      believes is also unsuitable, since it will not be conceded by any
      respondent. The problem must have some doubts and difficulties, in
      order to afford scope for discussion; yet it must not be one of
      which the premisses are far-fetched or recondite, for that goes
      beyond the limits of dialectic exercise.<a name="FnAnchor9_27" href="#Footnote9_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> It ought to
      be one on which opinions are known to be held, both in the
      affirmative and in the negative; on which either the multitude
      differ among themselves, the majority being on one side, while yet
      there is an adverse minority; or some independent authority stands
      opposed to the multitude, such as a philosopher of eminence, a
      professional man or artist speaking on his own particular craft, a
      geometer or a physician on the specialities of his department.
      Matters such as these are the appropriate subjects for dialectic
      debate; and new matters akin to them by way of analogy may be
      imagined and will be perfectly admissible.<a name="FnAnchor9_28" href="#Footnote9_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> Even an
      ingenious paradox or thesis adverse to prevailing opinions may
      serve the purpose, as likely to obtain countenance from some
      authority, though as yet we know of none.<a name="FnAnchor9_29" href="#Footnote9_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a></p>

        considers the question, Whether we ought rather to obey the laws
        of the state or the commands of our parents, in case of
        discrepancy between the two,-—as quite fit for debate (xiv. p.

        note here: it is the technical term of the Analyt. Post.,
        denoting that application of the syllogism which contrasts with
        Dialectic altogether.</p>
      <p> Aristotle here means only that problems falling within these
        limits are the best for dialectic discussion; but, in his
        suggestions later on, he includes problems for discussion
        involving the utmost generalities of philosophy. For example, he
        often adverts to dialectic debate on the Platonic Ideas or Forms
        (Topic. II. vii. p. 113, a. 25; V. vii. p. 137, b. 7; VI. vi. p.
        143, b. 24. Compare also I. xi. p. 104, b. 14.)</p>

      conditions apply both to problems propounded for debate, and to
      premisses tendered on either side during the discussion. Both the
      interrogator and the respondent — the former having to put
      appropriate questions, and the latter to make appropriate answers
      — must know and keep in mind these varieties of existing opinion
      among the multitude as well as among the special dissident
      authorities above indicated. The dialectician ought to collect and
      catalogue such <i>Endoxa</i>, with the opinions analogous to
      them, out of written treatises and elsewhere;<a name="FnAnchor9_30" href="#Footnote9_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
      distributing them under convenient heads, such as those relating
      to good and evil generally, and to each special class of good,
      &amp;c. Aristotle, however, admonishes him that he is debating
      problems not scientifically, but dialectically: having reference
      not to truth, but to opinion.<a name="FnAnchor9_31" href="#Footnote9_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> If the
      interrogator were proceeding scientifically and didactically, he
      would make use of all true and ascertained propositions, whether
      the respondent conceded them or not, as premisses for his
      syllogism. But in Dialectic he is dependent on the concession of
      the respondent, and can construct his syllogisms only from
      premisses that have been conceded to him.<a name="FnAnchor9_32" href="#Footnote9_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Hence he
      must keep as closely as he can to opinions carrying extrinsic
      authority, as being those which the respondent will hesitate to
      disallow.<a name="FnAnchor9_33" href="#Footnote9_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>

    <p> Moreover, the form of the interrogation admissible in dialectic
      debate is peculiar. The respondent is not bound to furnish any
      information in his answer: he is bound only to admit, or to deny,
      a proposition tendered to him. You must not ask him, What is the
      genus of man? You must yourself declare the genus, and ask whether
      he admits it, in one or other of the two following forms — (1) Is
      animal the genus of man? (2) Is animal the genus of man, or not?
      to which the response is an admission or a denial.<a name="FnAnchor9_34" href="#Footnote9_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>

    <p> Dialectic procedure, both of the assailant and of the defendant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
      has to do with propositions and problems; accordingly, Aristotle
      introduces a general distribution of propositions under four
      heads. The predicate must either be Genus, or Proprium, or
      Accident, of its subject. But the Proprium divides itself again
      into two. It always reciprocates with, or is co-extensive with,
      its subject; but sometimes it declares the essence of the subject,
      sometimes it does not. When it declares the essence of the
      subject, Aristotle calls it the Definition; when it does not
      declare the essence of the subject, although reciprocating
      therewith, he reserves for it the title of Proprium. Every
      proposition, and every problem, the entire material of Dialectic,
      will declare one of these four — Proprium, Definition, Genus, or
      Accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_35" href="#Footnote9_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> The Differentia, as being attached to
      the Genus, is ranked along with the Genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_36" href="#Footnote9_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a></p>

    <p> The above four general heads include all the Predicables, which
      were distributed by subsequent logicians (from whom Porphyry
      borrowed) into five heads instead of four — Genus, Species,
      Differentia, Proprium, Accident; the Differentia being ranked as a
      separate item in the quintuple distribution, and the Species
      substituted in place of the Definition. It is under this quadruple
      classification that Aristotle intends to consider propositions and
      problems as matters for dialectic procedure: he will give
      argumentative suggestions applicable to each of the four
      successively. It might be practicable (he thinks) to range all the
      four under the single head of Definition; since arguments
      impugning Genus, Proprium, and Accident, are all of them good also
      against Definition. But such a simplification would be perplexing
      and unmanageable in regard to dialectic procedure.<a name="FnAnchor9_37" href="#Footnote9_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> That the quadruple classification is exhaustive, and that every
      proposition or problem falls under one or other of the four heads,
      may be shown in two ways. First, by Induction: survey and analyse
      as many propositions as you will, all without exception will be
      found to belong to one of the four.<a name="FnAnchor9_38" href="#Footnote9_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> Secondly, by
      the following Deductive proof:— In every proposition the predicate
      is either co-extensive and reciprocating with the subject, or it
      is not. If it does reciprocate, it either declares the essence of
      the subject, or it does not: if the former, it is the Definition;
      if the latter, it is a Proprium. But, supposing the predicate not
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>to

      reciprocate with the subject, it will either declare something
      contained in the Definition, or it will not. If it does contain a
      part of the Definition, that part must be either a Genus or a
      Differentia, since these are the constituents of the Definition.
      If it does not contain any such part, it must be an Accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_39" href="#Footnote9_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
      Hence it appears that every proposition must belong to one or
      other of the four, and that the classification is exhaustive.</p>

      <p> It will be observed that Aristotle here resolves Definition
        into Genus and Differentiæ — &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8052; &#8001; &#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
        &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;. Moreover, though he does not recognize Species
        as a separate head, yet in his definition of Genus he implies
        Species as known — &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#949;&#953;</span> &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;

      <p> It thus appears that the quintuple classification is the real
        and logical one; but the quadruple may perhaps be more suitable
        for the Topica, with a view to dialectic procedure, since
        debates turn upon the attack and defence of a Definition.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Moreover, each of the four Predicables must fall under one or
      other of the ten Categories or Predicaments. If the predicate be
      either of Genus or Definition, declaring the essence of the
      subject, it may fall under any one of the ten Categories; if of
      Proprium or Accident, not declaring essence, it cannot belong to
      the first Category (&#927;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;), but must fall under one of the
      remaining nine.<a name="FnAnchor9_40" href="#Footnote9_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

    <p> The notion of Sameness or Identity occurs so often in dialectic
      debate, that Aristotle discriminates its three distinct senses or
      grades: (1) <i>Numero</i>; (2) <i>Specie</i>; (3) <i>Genere</i>.
      Water from the same spring is only <i>idem specie</i>, though the
      resemblance between two cups of water from the same spring is far
      greater than that between water from different sources. Even <i>Idem

        Numero</i> has different significations: sometimes there are
      complete synonyms; sometimes an individual is called by its
      proprium, sometimes by its peculiar temporary accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_41" href="#Footnote9_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a></p>

        Ibid. vii. p. 103, a. 6-39.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Having thus classified dialectic propositions, Aristotle
      proceeds to the combination of propositions, or dialectic
      discourse and argument. This is of two sorts, either Induction or
      Syllogism; of both which we have already heard in the Analytica.
      Induction is declared to be plainer, more persuasive, nearer to
      sensible experience, and more suitable to the many, than
      Syllogism; while this latter carries greater compulsion and is
      more irresistible against professed disputants.<a name="FnAnchor9_42" href="#Footnote9_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
      A particular example is given to illustrate what Induction is. But
      we remark that though it is always mentioned as an argumentative
      procedure important and indispensable, yet neither here nor
      elsewhere does Aristotle go into any discriminative analysis of
      the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
      under which it is valid, as he does about Syllogism in the

      (1) He must make a large collection of Propositions; (2) He must

      indicated that those wanted are such as declare <i>Endoxa</i>,
      and other modes of thought cognate or <span class="correction" title="amended from 'analgous'">analogous</span> to the <i>Endoxa</i>:<a name="FnAnchor9_44" href="#Footnote9_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
      opinions of the many, and opinions of any small sections or
      individuals carrying authority. All such are to be collected (out
      of written treatises as well as from personal enquiry); nor are
      individual philosophers (like Empedokles) to be omitted, since a
      proposition is likely enough to be conceded when put upon the
      authority of an illustrious name.<a name="FnAnchor9_45" href="#Footnote9_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> If any
      proposition is currently admitted as true in general or in most
      cases, it must be tendered with confidence to the respondent as an
      universal principle; for he will probably grant it, not being at
      first aware of the exceptions.<a name="FnAnchor9_46" href="#Footnote9_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> All
      propositions must be registered in the most general terms

      be carried.<a name="FnAnchor9_47" href="#Footnote9_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a></p>

    <p> 2. The propositions having been got together, they must be
      examined in order to find out Equivocation or double meaning of
      terms. There are various ways of going about this task. Sometimes
      the same predicate is applied to two different subjects, but in
      different senses; thus, courage and justice are both of them good,
      but in a different way. Sometimes the same predicate is applied to
      two different classes of subjects, each admitting of being
      defined; thus, health is good in itself, and exercise is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>good

      as being among those things that promote health.<a name="FnAnchor9_48" href="#Footnote9_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
      Sometimes the equivocal meaning of a term is perceived by
      considering its contrary; if we find that it has two or more
      distinct contraries, we know at once that it has different
      meanings. Sometimes, though there are not two distinct contraries,
      yet the mere conjunction of the same adjective with two
      substantives shows us at once that it cannot mean the same in both<a name="FnAnchor9_49" href="#Footnote9_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
      (&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8052; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#942; — &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#945;). In one sense, the term may have an
      assignable contrary, while in another sense it may have no
      contrary; showing that the two senses are distinct: for example,
      the pleasure of drinking has for its contrary the pain of thirst;
      but the pleasure of scientifically contemplating that the diagonal
      of a square is incommensurable with the side, has no contrary;
      hence, we see that pleasure is an equivocal term.<a name="FnAnchor9_50" href="#Footnote9_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
      In one sense, there may be a term intermediate between the two
      contraries; in another sense, there may be none; or there may be
      two distinct intermediate terms for the two distinct senses; or
      there may be several intermediate terms in one of the senses, and
      only one or none in the other: in each of these ways the
      equivocation is revealed.<a name="FnAnchor9_51" href="#Footnote9_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> We must look
      also to the contradictory opposite (of a term), which may perhaps
      have an obvious equivocation of meaning; thus, &#956;&#8052; &#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957; means
      sometimes to be blind, sometimes not to be seeing actually, whence
      we discover that &#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957; also has the same equivocation.<a name="FnAnchor9_52" href="#Footnote9_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
      If a positive term is equivocal, we know that the privative term
      correlating with it must also be equivocal; thus, &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
      has a double sense, according as we speak with reference to mind
      or body; and this will be alike true of the correlating privative
      — &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;.<a name="FnAnchor9_53" href="#Footnote9_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> Farther, an equivocal term will have
      its derivatives equivocal in the same manner; and conversely, if
      the derivative be equivocal, the radical will be so likewise.<a name="FnAnchor9_54" href="#Footnote9_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
      The term must also be looked at in reference to the ten
      Categories: if its meanings fall under more than one Category, we
      know that it is equivocal.<a name="FnAnchor9_55" href="#Footnote9_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> If it
      comprehends two subjects which are not in the same genus, or in
      genera not subordinate one to the other, this too will show that
      it is equivocal.<a name="FnAnchor9_56" href="#Footnote9_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> The contrary, also, of the term must
      be looked at with a view to the same inference.<a name="FnAnchor9_57" href="#Footnote9_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a></p>

    <p> Again, it will be useful to bring together the same term in two
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>different

      conjunctions, and to compare the definitions of the two. Define
      both of them, and then deduct what is peculiar to each <i>definitum</i>:
      if the remainder be different, the term will be equivocal; if the
      remainder be the same, the term will be univocal. Thus, &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#957;
      &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; will be defined, a body having such and such a colour: &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8052;
      &#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;, a voice easily and distinctly heard: deduct &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; from the
      first definition, and &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8052; from the second, the remainder will be
      totally disparate; therefore, the term &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#957; is equivocal.<a name="FnAnchor9_58" href="#Footnote9_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
      Sometimes, also, the ambiguity may be found in definitions
      themselves, where the same term is used to explain subjects that
      are not the same; whether such use is admissible, has to be
      considered.<a name="FnAnchor9_59" href="#Footnote9_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> If the term be univocal, two
      conjunctions of it may always be compared as to greater or less,
      or in respect of likeness; whenever this cannot be, the term is
      equivocal.<a name="FnAnchor9_60" href="#Footnote9_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> If, again, the term is used as a
      differentia for two genera quite distinct and independent of each
      other, it must be equivocal; for genera that are unconnected and
      not subordinate one to the other, have their differentiæ also
      disparate.<a name="FnAnchor9_61" href="#Footnote9_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> And, conversely, if the term be such
      that the differentiæ applied to it are disparate, we may know it
      to be an equivocal term. The like, if the term be used as a
      species in some of its conjunctions, and as a differentia in
      others.<a name="FnAnchor9_62" href="#Footnote9_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> </p>

    <p> 3. Aristotle has thus indicated, at considerable length, the
      points to be looked for when we are examining whether a term is
      univocal or equivocal. He is more concise when he touches on the
      last two out of the four helps (&#8004;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#945;) enumerated for supplying
      syllogisms when needed, — viz. the study of Differences and of
      Resemblances. In regard to the study of Differences, standing
      third, while he remarks that, where these are wide and numerous,
      they are sure without any precept to excite our attention, he
      advises that we should study the differences of subjects that are
      nearly allied, — those within the same genus, or comprehended in
      genera not much removed from one another, such as, the distinction
      between sensible perception and science. But he goes into no
      detail.<a name="FnAnchor9_63" href="#Footnote9_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a></p>

        Ibid. xvi. p. 107, b. 39.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 4. In regard to the study of Resemblances, he inverts the above
      precept, and directs us to note especially the points of
      resemblance between subjects of great apparent difference.<a name="FnAnchor9_64" href="#Footnote9_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
      We must examine what is the quality common to all species of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>same

      genus — man, horse, dog, &amp;c.; for it is in this that they are
      similar. We may also compare different genera with each other, in
      respect to the analogies that are to be found in each: <i>e.g.</i>,
      as science is to the cognizable, so is perception to the
      perceivable; as sight is in the eye, so is intellection in the
      soul; as &#947;&#945;&#955;&#942;&#957;&#951; is in the sea, so is &#957;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#945; in the air.<a name="FnAnchor9_65" href="#Footnote9_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a></p>

    <p> Such are the four distinct helps, towards facility of
      syllogizing, enumerated by Aristotle. It will be observed that the
      third and fourth (study of Resemblances and Differences) bear more
      upon matters of fact and less upon words; while the second (&#964;&#8056;
      &#960;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962;), though doubtless also bearing on matters of fact and
      deriving from thence its main real worth, yet takes its departure
      from terms and propositions, and proceeds by comparing multiplied
      varieties of these in regard to diversity of meaning. Upon this
      ground it is, apparently, that Aristotle has given so much fuller
      development to the second head than to the third and fourth; for,
      in the Topica, he is dealing with propositions and
      counter-propositions — with opinions and counter-opinions, not
      with science and truth. </p>
    <p> He proceeds to indicate the different ways in which these three
      helps (the second, third, and fourth) further the purpose of the
      dialectician — respondent as well as assailant. Unless the
      different meanings of the term be discriminated, the respondent
      cannot know clearly what he admits or what he denies; he may be
      thinking of something different from what the assailant intends,
      and the syllogisms constructed may turn upon a term only, not upon
      any reality.<a name="FnAnchor9_66" href="#Footnote9_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> The respondent will be able to
      protect himself better against being driven into contradiction, if
      he can distinguish the various meanings of the same term; for he
      will thus know whether the syllogisms brought against him touch
      the real matter which he has admitted.<a name="FnAnchor9_67" href="#Footnote9_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> On the other
      hand, the assailant will have much facility in driving his
      opponent into contradiction, if he (the assailant) can distinguish
      the different meanings of the term, while the respondent cannot do
      so; in those cases at least where the proposition is true in one
      sense of the term and false in another.<a name="FnAnchor9_68" href="#Footnote9_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> This manner

      and his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>arguments

      upon a mere unanalysed term, unless he can find absolutely nothing

    <p> The third help (an acquaintance with Differences) will be of
      much avail on all occasions where we have to syllogize upon Same
      and Different, and where we wish to ascertain the essence or
      definition of any thing; for we ascertain this by exclusion of
      what is foreign thereunto, founded on the appropriate differences
      in each case.<a name="FnAnchor9_70" href="#Footnote9_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a></p>
    <p> </p>
    <div class="footnote">

    <p> Lastly, the fourth help (the intelligent survey of Resemblances)
      serves us in different ways:— (1) Towards the construction of
      inductive arguments; (2) Towards syllogizing founded upon
      assumption; (3) Towards the declaration of definitions. As to the
      inductive argument, it is founded altogether on a repetition of
      similar particulars, whereby the universal is obtained.<a name="FnAnchor9_71" href="#Footnote9_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
      As to the syllogizing from an assumption, the knowledge of
      resemblances is valuable, because we are entitled to assume, as an
      <i>Endoxon</i> or a doctrine conformable to common opinion, that
      what happens in any one of a string of similar cases will happen
      also in all the rest. We lay down this as the major proposition of
      a syllogism; and thus, if we can lay hold of any one similar case,
      we can draw inference from it to the matter actually in debate.<a name="FnAnchor9_72" href="#Footnote9_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
      Again, as to the declaration of definitions, when we have once
      discovered what is the same in all particular cases, we shall have
      ascertained to what genus the subject before us belongs;<a name="FnAnchor9_73" href="#Footnote9_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
      for that one of the common predicates which is most of the
      essence, will be the genus. Even where the two matters compared
      are more disparate than we can rank in the same genus, the
      knowledge of resemblances will enable us to discover useful
      analogies, and thus to obtain a definition at least approximative.
      Thus, as the point is in a line, so is the unit in numbers; each
      of them is a <i>principium</i>; this, therefore, is a common
      genus, which will serve as a tolerable definition. Indeed this is
      the definition of them commonly given by philosophers; who call
      the unit <i>principium</i> of number, and the point <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span><i>principium</i>
      of a line, thus putting one and the other into a genus common to
      both.<a name="FnAnchor9_74" href="#Footnote9_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a></p>

        It will be recollected that all the work of Dialectic (as
        Aristotle tells us often) has reference to &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; and not to
        scientific truth. “We shall <i>seem to define</i> not in a
        manner departing from the reality of the subject” is, therefore,
        an appropriate dialectic artifice.</p>

    <h2>II.</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The First Book of the Topica, which we have thus gone through,
      was entitled by some ancient commentators &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#932;&#972;&#960;&#969;&#957; —
      matters preliminary to the <i>Loci</i>. This is quite true, as a
      description of its contents; for Aristotle in the last words of
      the book, distinctly announces that he is about to enumerate the <i>Loci</i>
      towards which the four above-mentioned <i>Organa</i> will be
      useful.<a name="FnAnchor9_75" href="#Footnote9_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a></p>

      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote9_75" id="Footnote9_75"></a><a href="#FnAnchor9_75">75</a></span>
        Ibid. p. 108, b. 32: &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#959;&#8019;&#962; &#967;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#953;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#967;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#945;
        &#959;&#7989;&#948;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#943;&#957;.</p>
    </div>
    <p> <i>Locus</i> (&#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;) is a place in which many arguments
      pertinent to one and the same dialectical purpose, may be found —
      <i>sedes argumentorum</i>. In each <i>locus</i>, the arguments
      contained therein look at the thesis from the same point of view;
      and the <i>locus</i> implies nothing distinct from the arguments,
      except this manner of view common to them all. In fact, the
      metaphor is a convenient one for designating the relation of every
      Universal generally to its particulars: the Universal is not a new
      particular, nor any adjunct superimposed upon all its particulars,
      but simply a <i>place</i> in which all known similar particulars
      may be found grouped together, and in which there is room for an
      indefinite number of new ones. If we wish to arm the student with
      a large command of dialectical artifices, we cannot do better than
      discriminate the various groups of arguments, indicating the point
      of view common to each group, and the circumstances in which it
      becomes applicable. By this means, whenever he is called upon to
      deal with a new debate, he will consider the thesis in reference
      to each one of these different <i>loci</i>, and will be able to
      apply arguments out of each of them, according as the case may
      admit.</p>
    <p> The four <i>Helps</i> (&#8004;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#945;) explained in the last book
      differ from the <i>Loci</i> in being of wider and more undefined
      bearing: they are directions for preparatory study, rather than
      for dealing with any particular situation of a given problem;
      though it must be confessed that, when Aristotle proceeds to
      specify the manner in which the three last-mentioned helps are
      useful, he makes considerable approach towards the greater detail
      and particularization<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span> of the <i>Loci</i>. In entering
      now upon these, he reverts to that quadruple classification of
      propositions and problems (according to the four Predicables),
      noted at the beginning of the treatise, in which the predicate is
      either Definition, Proprium, Genus, or Accident, of the subject.
      He makes a fourfold distribution of <i>Loci</i>, according as
      they bear upon one or other of these four. In the Second and Third
      Books, we find those which bear upon propositions predicating
      Accident; in the Fourth Book, we pass to Genus; in the Fifth, to
      Proprium; in the Sixth and Seventh, to Definition.</p>
    <p> The problem or thesis propounded for debate may have two faults
      on which it may be impugned: either it may be untrue; or it may be
      expressed in a way departing from the received phraseology.<a name="FnAnchor9_76" href="#Footnote9_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a>
      It will be universal, or particular, or indefinite; and either
      affirmative or negative; but, in most cases, the respondent
      propounds for debate an affirmative universal, and not a negative
      or a particular.<a name="FnAnchor9_77" href="#Footnote9_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> Aristotle therefore begins with those
      <i>loci</i> that are useful for refuting an Affirmative Universal;
      though, in general, the same arguments are available for attack
      and defence both of the universal and of the particular; for if
      you can overthrow the particular, you will have overthrown the
      universal along with it, while if you can defend the universal,
      this will include the defence of the particular. As the thesis
      propounded is usually affirmative, the assailant undertakes the
      negative side or the work of refutation. And this indeed (as
      Eudemus, the pupil of Aristotle, remarked, after his master<a name="FnAnchor9_78" href="#Footnote9_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a>)
      is the principal function and result of dialectic exercise; which
      refutes much and proves very little, according to the analogy of
      the Platonic Dialogues of Search.</p>

    <p> Aristotle takes the four heads — Accident, Genus, Proprium, and
      Definition, in the order here enumerated. The thesis of which the
      predicate is enunciated as Accident, affirms the least, is easiest
      to defend, and hardest to upset.<a name="FnAnchor9_79" href="#Footnote9_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> When we
      enunciate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>Genus

      or Proprium, we affirm, not merely that the predicate belongs to
      the subject (which is all that is affirmed in the case of
      Accident), but, also something more — that it belongs to the
      subject in a certain manner and relation. And when we enunciate
      Definition, we affirm all this and something reaching yet farther
      — that it declares the whole essence of the <i>definitum</i>, and
      is convertible therewith. Accordingly, the thesis of Definition,
      affirming as it does so very much, presents the most points of
      attack and is by far the hardest to defend.<a name="FnAnchor9_80" href="#Footnote9_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> Next in
      point of difficulty, for the respondent, comes the Proprium.</p>

    <p> Beginning thus with the thesis enunciating Accident, Aristotle
      enumerates no less than thirty-seven distinct <i>loci</i> or
      argumentative points of view bearing upon it. Most of them suggest
      modes of assailing the thesis; but there are also occasionally
      intimations to the respondent how he may best defend himself. In
      this numerous list there are indeed some items repetitions of each
      other, or at least not easily distinguishable.<a name="FnAnchor9_81" href="#Footnote9_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
      As it would be tedious to enumerate them all, I shall select some
      of the most marked and illustrative.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote9_81" id="Footnote9_81"></a><a href="#FnAnchor9_81">81</a></span>
        Aristotle himself admits the repetition in some cases, Topic.
        II. ii. p. 110, a. 12: the fourth <i>locus</i> is identical
        substantially with the second <i>locus</i>.</p>
      <p> Theophrastus distinguished &#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#956;&#945; as the general precept,
        from &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962; or <i>locus</i>, as any proposition specially
        applying the precept to a particular case (Schol. p. 264, b.
        38).</p>
    </div>
    <p> 1. The respondent has enunciated a certain predicate as
      belonging in the way of accident, to a given subject. Perhaps it
      may belong to the subject; yet not as accident, but under some one
      of the other three Predicables. Perhaps he may have enunciated
      (either by explicit discrimination, or at least by implication
      contained in his phraseology) the genus as if it were an accident,
      — an error not unfrequently committed.<a name="FnAnchor9_82" href="#Footnote9_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> Thus, if he
      has said, To be a colour is an accident of white, he has affirmed
      explicitly the genus as if it were an accident. And he has
      affirmed the same by implication, if he has said, White (or
      whiteness) is coloured. For this is a form of words not proper for
      the affirmation of a genus respecting its species, in which case
      the genus itself ought to stand as a literal predicate (White is a
      colour), and not to be replaced by one of its derivatives (White
      is coloured). Nor can the proposition be intended to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>taken

      as affirming either proprium or definition; for in both these the
      predicate would reciprocate and be co-extensive with the subject,
      whereas in the present case there are obviously many other
      subjects of which it may be predicated that they are coloured.<a name="FnAnchor9_83" href="#Footnote9_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a>
      In saying, White is coloured, the respondent cannot mean to affirm
      either genus, proprium, or definition; therefore he must mean to
      affirm <i>accident</i>. The assailant will show that this is
      erroneous.</p>

        We may find cases in which Aristotle has not been careful to
        maintain the strict logical sense of &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; or &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#941;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;
        where he applies these terms to Genus or Proprium: <i>e.g.</i>
        Topic. II. iii. p. 110, b. 24; Soph. El. vi. p. 168, b. 1.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 2. Suppose the thesis set up by the respondent to be an
      universal affirmative, or an universal negative. You (the
      interrogator or assailant) should review the particulars contained
      under these universals. Review them not at once as separate
      individuals, but as comprised in subordinate genera and species;
      beginning from the highest, and descending down to the lowest
      species which is not farther divisible except into individuals.
      Thus, if the thesis propounded be, The cognition of opposites is
      one and the same cognition; you will investigate whether this can
      be truly predicated respecting all the primary species of <i>Opposita</i>:
      respecting <i>Relata</i> and <i>Correlata</i>, respecting
      Contraries, respecting Contradictories, respecting <i>Habitus</i>
      and <i>Privatio</i>. If, by going thus far, you obtain no result
      favourable to your purpose,<a name="FnAnchor9_84" href="#Footnote9_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> you must
      proceed farther, and subdivide until you come to the lowest
      species:— Is the cognition of just and unjust one and the same?
      that of double and half? of sight and blindness? of existence and
      non-existence? If in all, or in any one, of these cases you can
      show that the universal thesis does not hold, you will have gained
      your point of refuting it. On the other hand, if, when you have
      enumerated many particulars, the thesis is found to hold in all,
      the respondent is entitled to require you to grant it as an
      universal proposition, unless you can produce a satisfactory
      counter-example. If you decline this challenge, you will be
      considered an unreasonable debater.<a name="FnAnchor9_85" href="#Footnote9_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a></p>

    <p> 3. You will find it useful to define both the accident
      predicated in the thesis, and the subject respecting which it is
      predicated, or at least one of them: you will see then whether
      these definitions reveal anything false in the affirmation of the
      thesis. Thus, if the thesis affirms that it is possible to do
      injustice to a god, you will define what is meant by doing
      injustice. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>definition is — hurting
      intentionally: you can thus refute the thesis by showing that no
      injustice to a god can possibly be done; for a god cannot be hurt.<a name="FnAnchor9_86" href="#Footnote9_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a>
      Or let the thesis maintained be, The virtuous man is envious. You
      define envy, and you find that it is — vexation felt by reason of
      the manifest success of some meritorious man. Upon this definition
      it is plain that the virtuous man cannot feel envy: he would be
      worthless, if he did feel it. Perhaps some of the terms employed
      in your definition may themselves require definition; if so, you
      will repeat the process of defining until you come to something
      plain and clear.<a name="FnAnchor9_87" href="#Footnote9_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> Such an analysis will often bring out
      some error at first unperceived in the thesis.</p>

    <p> 4. It will be advisable, both for assailant and respondent, to
      discriminate those cases in which the authority of the multitude
      is conclusive from those in which it is not. Thus, in regard to
      the meaning of terms and in naming objects, we must speak like the
      multitude; but, when the question is as to what objects deserve to
      be denominated so and so, we must not feel bound by the multitude,
      if there be any special dissentient authority.<a name="FnAnchor9_88" href="#Footnote9_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a>
      That which produces good health we must call wholesome, as the
      multitude do; but, in calling this or that substance wholesome,
      the physician must be our guide. </p>

    <p> 5. Aristotle gives more than one suggestion as to those cases in
      which the terms of the thesis have a double or triple sense, yet
      in which the thesis is propounded either as an universal
      affirmative or as an universal negative. If the respondent is
      himself not aware of the double sense of his thesis, while you
      (the questioner) are aware of it, you will prove the point which
      you are seeking to establish against him in one or other of the
      two senses, if you cannot prove it in both. If he is aware of it
      in the double sense, he will insist that you have chosen the sense
      which he did not intend.<a name="FnAnchor9_89" href="#Footnote9_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> This mode of
      procedure will be available to the respondent as well as to you;
      but it will be harder to him, since his thesis is universal. For,
      in order to make good an universal thesis, he must obtain your
      assent to a preliminary assumption or convention, that, if he can
      prove it in one sense of the terms, it shall be held proved in
      both; and, unless the proposition be so plausible that you are
      disposed to grant him this, he will not succeed in the procedure.<a name="FnAnchor9_90" href="#Footnote9_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a>
      But you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>on

      your side, as refuting, do not require any such preliminary
      convention or acquiescence; for, if you prove the negative in any
      single case, you succeed in overthrowing the universal
      affirmative, while, if you prove the affirmative in any single
      case, you succeed in overthrowing the universal negative.<a name="FnAnchor9_91" href="#Footnote9_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
      Such procedure, however, is to be adopted only when you can find
      no argument applicable to the equivocal thesis in all its separate
      meanings; this last sort of argument, wherever it can be found,
      being always better.<a name="FnAnchor9_92" href="#Footnote9_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a></p>

    <p> 6. Observe that a predicate which belongs to the genus does not
      necessarily belong to any one of its species, but that any
      predicate which belongs to one of the species does belong also to
      the genus; on the other hand, that any predicate which can be
      denied of the genus may be denied also of all its contained
      species, but that any predicate which can be denied of some one or
      some portion of the contained species cannot for that reason be
      denied of the genus. You may thus prove from one species to the
      genus, and disprove from the genus to each one species; but not <i>vice

        versâ</i>. Thus, if the respondent grants that there exist
      cognitions both estimable and worthless, you are warranted in
      inferring that there exist habits of mind estimable and worthless;
      for cognition is a species under the genus habit of mind. But if
      the negative were granted, that there exist no cognitions both
      estimable and worthless, you could not for that reason infer that
      there are no habits of mind estimable and worthless. So, if it
      were granted to you that there are judgments correct and
      erroneous, you could not for that reason infer <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>that

      there were perceptions of sense correct and erroneous; perceiving
      by sense being a species under the genus judging. But, if it were
      granted that there were no judgments correct and erroneous, you
      might thence infer the like negative about perceptions of sense.<a name="FnAnchor9_95" href="#Footnote9_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a></p>

      <p> It is here a point deserving attention, that Aristotle ranks
        &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; as a species under the genus &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;. This is
        a notable circumstance in the Aristotelian psychology.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 7. Keep in mind also that if there be any subject of which you
      can affirm the genus, of that same subject you must be able to
      affirm one or other of the species contained under the genus.
      Thus, if science be a predicate applicable, grammar, music, or
      some other of the special sciences must also be applicable: if any
      man can be called truly a scientific man, he must be a grammarian,
      a musician, or some other specialist. Accordingly, if the thesis
      set up by your respondent be, The soul is moved, you must examine
      whether any one of the known varieties of motion can be truly
      predicated of the soul, <i>e.g.</i>, increase, destruction,
      generation, &amp;c. If none of these special predicates is
      applicable to the soul, neither is the generic predicate
      applicable to it; and you will thus have refuted the thesis. This
      <i>locus</i> may serve as a precept for proof as well as for
      refutation; for, equally, if the soul be moved in any one species
      of motion, it is moved, and, if the soul be not moved in any
      species of motion, it is not moved.<a name="FnAnchor9_96" href="#Footnote9_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a></p>

    <p> 8. Where the thesis itself presents no obvious hold for
      interrogation, turn over the various definitions that have been
      proposed of its constituent terms; one or other of these
      definitions will often afford matter for attack.<a name="FnAnchor9_97" href="#Footnote9_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a>
      Look also to the antecedents and consequents of the thesis — what
      must be assumed and what will follow, if the thesis be granted. If
      you can disprove the consequent of the proposition, you will have
      disproved the proposition itself. On the other hand, if the
      antecedent of the proposition be proved, the proposition itself
      will be proved also.<a name="FnAnchor9_98" href="#Footnote9_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> Examine also whether the proposition

      What takes nourishment grows necessarily, is true not always, but
      only for a certain time: animals take nourishment during all their
      lives, but grow only during a part of their lives. Or, if a man
      should say that knowing is remembering, this is incorrect; for we

    <p> 9. It is a sophistical procedure (so Aristotle terms it) to
      transfer the debate to some point on which we happen to be well
      provided with arguments, lying apart from the thesis defended.
      Such transfer, however, may be sometimes necessary. In other cases
      it is not really but only apparently necessary; in still other
      cases it is purely gratuitous, neither really nor apparently
      necessary. It is really necessary, when the respondent, having
      denied some proposition perfectly relevant to his thesis, stands
      to his denial and accepts the debate upon it, the proposition
      being one on which a good stock of arguments may be found against
      him; also, when you are endeavouring to disprove the thesis by an
      induction of negative analogies.<a name="FnAnchor9_100" href="#Footnote9_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a> It is only
      apparently, and not really, necessary, when the proposition in
      debate is not perfectly relevant to the thesis, but merely has the
      semblance of being so. It is neither really nor apparently
      necessary, when there does not exist even this semblance of
      relevance, and when some other way is open of bringing
      bye-confutation to bear on the respondent. You ought to avoid
      entirely such a procedure in this last class of cases; for it is
      an abuse of the genuine purpose of Dialectic. If you do resort to
      it, the respondent should grant your interrogations, but at the
      same time notify that they are irrelevant to the thesis. Such
      notification will render his concessions rather troublesome than
      advantageous for your purpose.<a name="FnAnchor9_101" href="#Footnote9_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a></p>

      granted by the respondent carries with it by implication many
      other propositions; since every affirmation has necessary
      consequences, more or fewer. Whoever says that Sokrates is a man,
      has said also that he is an animal, that he is a living creature,
      biped, capable of acquiring knowledge. If you can disprove any of
      these necessary consequences, you will have disproved the thesis
      itself. You must take care, however, that you fix upon some one of
      the consequences which is really easier, and not more difficult,
      to refute than the thesis itself.<a name="FnAnchor9_102" href="#Footnote9_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a></p>

    <p> 11. Perhaps the thesis set up by the respondent may be of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>such

      a nature that one or other of two contrary predicates must belong
      to the subject; <i>e.g.</i>, either health or sickness. In that
      case, if you are provided with arguments bearing on one of the two
      contraries, the same arguments will also serve indirectly for
      proof, or for disproof, of the other. Thus, if you show that one
      of the two contraries does belong to the subject, the same
      arguments prove that the other does not; <i>vice versâ</i>, if
      you show that one of them does not belong, it follows that the

      or usually, or by pure hazard. You will take notice in which of
      these three ways the respondent affirms it, and whether that which
      he chooses is conformable to the fact. If he affirms it as
      necessary, when it is really either usual or casual, the thesis
      will be open to your attacks. If he affirms it without clearly
      distinguishing in which of the three senses he intends it to be
      understood, you are at liberty to construe it in that one of the
      three senses which best suits your argument.<a name="FnAnchor9_105" href="#Footnote9_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a></p>

        &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#962;, or theses affirming or denying <i>accidental</i>

        respondent affirms the predicate as <i>necessary</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 14. Perhaps the thesis may have predicate and subject exactly
      synonymous, so that the same thing will be affirmed as an accident
      of itself. On this ground it will be assailable.<a name="FnAnchor9_106" href="#Footnote9_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a></p>

    <p> 15. Sometimes the thesis will have more than one proposition
      contrary to it. If so, you may employ in arguing against it that
      one among its various contraries which is most convenient for your
      purpose.<a name="FnAnchor9_107" href="#Footnote9_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> Perhaps the predicate (accidental)
      of the thesis may have some contrary: if it has, you will examine
      whether that contrary belongs to the subject of the thesis; and,
      should such be the case, you may use it as an argument to refute
      the thesis itself.<a name="FnAnchor9_108" href="#Footnote9_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> Or the predicate of the thesis may
      be such that, if the thesis be granted, it will follow as a
      necessary consequence that contrary predicates must belong to the
      same <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>subject.

      Thus, if the thesis be that the Platonic Ideas exist <i>in us</i>,
      it follows necessarily that they are both in motion and at rest;
      both perceivable by sense, and cogitable by intellect.<a name="FnAnchor9_109" href="#Footnote9_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a>
      As these two predicates (those constituting the first pair as well
      as the second pair) are contrary to each other, and cannot both
      belong to the same subject, this may be used as an argument
      against the thesis from which such consequence follows.</p>

        proceeds to state how this consequence arises. Those who affirm
        the Platonic Ideas, assign to them as fundamental
        characteristic, that they are at rest and cogitable. But, if the
        Ideas exist <i>in us</i>, they must be moveable, because <i>we</i>
        are moved; they must also be perceivable by sense, because it is
        through vision only that we discriminate and know differences of
        form. Waitz observes (in regard to the last pair, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#943;):
        “Nam singulæ ideæ certam quandam rerum speciem et formam
        exprimunt: species autem et forma oculis cernitur.” I do not
        clearly see, however, that this is a consequence of affirming
        Ideas to be &#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;; it is equally true if they are <i>not</i>
        &#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 16. We know that whatever is the recipient of one of two
      contraries, is capable also of becoming recipient of the other.
      If, therefore, the predicate of the thesis has any contrary, you
      will examine whether the subject of the thesis is capable of
      receiving such contrary. If not, you have an argument against the
      thesis. Let the thesis be, The appetitive principle is ignorant.
      If this be true, that principle must be capable of knowledge.<a name="FnAnchor9_110" href="#Footnote9_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a>

    <p> In regard to Contradictories, you are entitled, converting the

      proposition respecting the negation of the subject. Thus, if man

      not a man. You will prove this to be an universal rule by
      Induction; that is, by citing a multitude of particular cases in
      which it is indisputably true, without possibility of finding any
      one case in which it does not apply. If you can prove or disprove
      the converted obverse of the thesis — What is not an animal is not

      <p> Aristotle’s declaration, that this great logical rule can only
        be proved by Induction, deserves notice. I have remarked the
        same thing about his rules for the conversion of propositions,
        in the beginning of the Analytica Priora. See above, <a href="#page145">p. 145, seq.</a></p>

      regard to Contraries, you will study the thesis, to see whether
      the contrary of the predicate can be truly affirmed respecting the
      contrary of the subject, or whether the contrary of the subject
      can be truly affirmed respecting the contrary of the predicate.
      This last alternative occurs sometimes, but not often; in general
      the first alternative is found to be true. You must make good your
      point here also by Induction, or by repetition of particular
      examples. This <i>locus</i> will serve either for the purpose of
      refutation or for that of defence, according to circumstances. If
      neither of the two alternatives above-mentioned is found correct,
      this is an argument against the thesis.<a name="FnAnchor9_112" href="#Footnote9_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a></p>

    <p> In regard to <i>Habitus</i> and <i>Privatio</i>, the rule is
      the same as about Contraries; only that the first of the two above

      If sensible perception can be predicated of vision, insensibility

    <p> In regard to <i>Relata</i>, the inference holds from the
      correlate of the subject to the correlate of the predicate. If
      knowledge is belief, that which is known is believed; if vision is
      sensible perception, that which is visible is sensibly
      perceivable. Some say that there are cases in which the above does
      not hold; <i>e.g.</i>, That which is sensibly perceivable is
      knowable; yet sensible perception is not knowledge. But this
      objection is not valid; for many persons dispute the first of the
      two propositions. This <i>locus</i> will be equally available for
      the purpose of refutation — thus, you may argue — That which is
      sensibly perceivable is not knowable, because sensible perception
      is not knowledge.<a name="FnAnchor9_114" href="#Footnote9_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a></p>

      Arguments may often be drawn, both for proof and for refutation,
      from matters Similar or Analogous to the subject or predicate of
      the thesis. Thus, if one and the same cognition comprehends many
      things, one and the same opinion will also comprehend many things.
      If to possess vision is to see, then also to possess audition is
      to hear. If to possess audition is <i>not</i> to hear, then
      neither is to possess vision to see. The argument may be urged
      whether the resemblance is real or only generally supposed.
      Sometimes, however, the inference will not hold from one to many.
      Thus, if to know is to cogitate, then to know many things should
      be to cogitate many things. But this last is impossible. A man may
      know many things, but he cannot cogitate many things; therefore,
      to know is <i>not</i> to cogitate.<a name="FnAnchor9_116" href="#Footnote9_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a></p>

    <p> 20. There are various <i>loci</i> for argument, arising from
      degrees of Comparison — more, less, equally. One is the argument
      from concomitant variations, which is available both for proof and
      for disproof. If to do injustice is evil, to do more injustice is
      more evil. If an increase in degree of the subject implies an
      increase in degree of the predicate, then the predicate is truly
      affirmed; if not, not. This may be shown by Induction, or
      repetition of particular instances.<a name="FnAnchor9_117" href="#Footnote9_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a> Again,
      suppose the same predicate to be affirmable of two distinct
      subjects A and B, but to be more probably affirmable of A than of
      B. Then, if you can show that it does <i>not</i> belong to A, you
      may argue (<i>à fortiori</i>) that it does <i>not</i> belong to
      B; or, if you can show that it belongs to B, you may argue (<i>à
        fortiori</i>) that it belongs also to A. Or, if two distinct
      predicates be affirmable respecting the same subject but with
      unequal degrees of probability, then, if you can disprove the more
      probable of the two, you may argue from thence in disproof of the
      less probable; and, if you can prove the less probable, you may
      argue from thence in proof of the more probable. Or, if two
      distinct predicates be affirmable respecting two distinct subjects
      but with unequal degrees of probability, then, if you can disprove
      the more probable you may argue from thence against the less
      probable; and, if you can prove the less probable, you are
      furnished with an argument <span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>in proof of the more
      probable.<a name="FnAnchor9_118" href="#Footnote9_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a> If the degrees of probability,
      instead of being unequal, are equal or alike, you may still, in
      the cases mentioned, argue in like manner from proof or disproof
      of the one to proof or disproof of the other.<a name="FnAnchor9_119" href="#Footnote9_119"><span class="sp">119</span></a></p>

      If the subject, prior to adjunction of the attribute, be not white
      or good, and if adjunction of the attribute makes it white or
      good, then, you may argue that the adjunct must itself be white or
      good. And you might argue in like manner, if the subject prior to
      adjunction were to a certain extent white or good, but became more
      white or more good after such adjunction.<a name="FnAnchor9_120" href="#Footnote9_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a> But this <i>locus</i>
      will not be found available for the negative inference or
      refutation. You cannot argue, because the adjunction does not make
      the subject white or good, that therefore the adjunct itself is
      not white or not good.<a name="FnAnchor9_121" href="#Footnote9_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a></p>

    <p> 22. If the predicate be affirmable of the subject in greater or
      less degree, it must be affirmable of the subject simply and
      absolutely. Unless the subject be one that can be called white or
      good, you can never call it more white or more good. This <i>locus</i>
      again, however, cannot be employed in the negative, for the
      purpose of refutation. Because the predicate cannot be affirmed of
      the subject in greater or less degree, you are not warranted in
      inferring that it cannot be affirmed of the subject at all.
      Sokrates cannot be called in greater or less degree a man; but you
      cannot thence infer that he is not called a man simply.<a name="FnAnchor9_122" href="#Footnote9_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a>
      If the predicate can be denied of the subject simply and
      absolutely, it can be denied thereof with every sort of
      qualification: if it can be affirmed of the subject with
      qualification, it can also be affirmed thereof simply and
      absolutely, as a possible predicate.<a name="FnAnchor9_123" href="#Footnote9_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a> This,
      however, when it comes to be explained, means only that it can be
      affirmed of some among the particulars called by the name of the
      subject. Aristotle recognizes that the same predicate may often be
      affirmed of the subject <i>secundum quid</i>, and denied of the
      subject simply and absolutely. In some places (as among the
      Triballi), it is honourable to sacrifice your father; simply and
      absolutely, it is not honourable. To one who is sick, it is
      advantageous to undergo medical treatment; speaking simply and
      absolutely (<i>i.e.</i>, to persons generally in the ordinary
      state of health), it is not advantageous. It is only when you can
      truly affirm the proposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span> without adding any
      qualifying words, that the proposition is true simply and

    <h2>III.</h2>
    <p> Such are the chief among the thirty-seven <i>Loci</i> which
      Aristotle indicates for debating dialectically those theses in
      which the predication is only of Accident — not of Genus, or
      Proprium, or Definition. He proceeds (in the Third Book of the
      Topica) to deal separately with one special branch of such theses,
      respecting <i>Expetenda</i> and <i>Fugienda</i>: where the
      question put is, Of two or more distinct subjects, which is the
      more desirable or the better? The cases supposed are those in
      which the difference of value between the two subjects compared is
      not conspicuous and unmistakeable, but where there is a tolerably
      near approximation of value between them, so as to warrant doubt
      and debate.<a name="FnAnchor9_125" href="#Footnote9_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a></p>

    <p> We must presume that questions of this class occurred very
      frequently among the dialectical debates of Aristotle’s
      contemporaries; so that he thinks it necessary to give advice
      apart for conducting them in the best manner. </p>
    <p> 1. Of two good subjects compared, that is better and more
      desirable which is the more lasting; or which is preferred by the
      wise and good man; or by the professional artist in his own craft;
      or by right law; or by the multitude, all or most of them. That is
      absolutely or simply better and more desirable, which is declared
      to be such by the better cognition; that is better to any given
      individual, which is declared to be better by his own cognition.<a name="FnAnchor9_126" href="#Footnote9_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a></p>

        Topic. III. i. p. 116, a. 13-22.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 2. That is more desirable which is included in the genus good,
      than what is not so included; that which is desirable on its own
      account and <i>per se</i>, is better than what is desirable only
      on account of something else and <i>per accidens</i>; the cause
      of what is good in itself is more desirable than the cause of what
      is good by accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_127" href="#Footnote9_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a></p>
    <p> </p>

        Ibid. a. 23-b. 7.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 3. What is good absolutely and simply (<i>i.e.</i>, to all and
      at all times) is better than what is good only for a special
      occasion or individual; thus, to be in good health is better than
      being cut for the stone. What is good by nature is better than
      what is good not by nature; <i>e.g.</i>, justice (good by
      nature), than the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>just individual, whose character
      must have been acquired.<a name="FnAnchor9_128" href="#Footnote9_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> What is
      good, or what is peculiarly appurtenant, to the more elevated of
      two subjects is better than what is good or peculiar to the less
      elevated. Good, having its place in the better, prior, and more
      exalted elements of any subject, is more desirable than good
      belonging to the derivative, secondary, and less exalted; thus,
      health, which has its seat in proper admixture and proportion of
      the fundamental constituents of the body (wet, dry, hot, cold), is
      better than strength or beauty — strength residing in the bones
      and muscles, beauty in proper symmetry of the limbs.<a name="FnAnchor9_129" href="#Footnote9_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a>
      Next, an end is superior to that which is means thereunto; and, in
      comparing two distinct means, that which is nearer to the end is
      the better. That which tends to secure the great end of life is
      superior to that which tends towards any other end; means to
      happiness is better than means to intelligence; also the possible
      end, to the impossible. Comparing one subject as means with
      another subject as end, we must examine whether the second end is
      more superior to the end produced by the first subject, than the
      end produced by the first subject is superior to the means or
      first subject itself. For example, in the two ends, happiness and
      health, if happiness as an end surpasses health as an end in
      greater proportion than health surpasses the means of health, then
      the means producing happiness is better than the end health.<a name="FnAnchor9_130" href="#Footnote9_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a></p>

      <p> The reason given in this <i>locus</i> for superior estimation
        is a very curious one: the fundamental or primary constituents
        rank higher than compounds or derivatives formed by them or out
        of them. Also, the definition of beauty deserves attention: the
        Greeks considered beauty to reside more in proportions of form
        of the body than in features of the face.</p>

    </div>
    <p> Again, that which is more beautiful, honourable, and
      praiseworthy <i>per se</i>, is better than what possesses these
      same attributes in equal degree but only on account of some other
      consequence. Thus, friendship is superior to wealth, justice to
      strength; for no one values wealth except for its consequences,
      whereas we esteem friendship <i>per se</i>, even though no
      consequences ensue from it.<a name="FnAnchor9_131" href="#Footnote9_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a></p>

    <p> Where the two subjects compared are in themselves so nearly
      equal that the difference of merit can hardly be discerned, we
      must look to the antecedents or consequents of each, especially to
      the consequents; and, according as these exhibit most of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>good

      or least of evil, we must regulate our estimation of the two
      subjects to which they respectively belong.<a name="FnAnchor9_132" href="#Footnote9_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> The larger
      lot of good things is preferable to the smaller. Sometimes what is
      not in itself good, if cast into the same lot with other things
      very good, is preferable to another thing that is in itself good.
      Thus, what is not <i>per se</i> good, if it goes along with
      happiness, is preferable even to justice and courage. The same
      things, when taken along with pleasure or with the absence of
      pain, are preferable to themselves without pleasure or along with
      pain.<a name="FnAnchor9_133" href="#Footnote9_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> Everything is better, at the season
      when it tells for most, than itself at any other season; thus,
      intelligence and absence of pain are to be ranked as of more value
      in old age than in youth; but courage and temperance are more
      indispensably required, and therefore more to be esteemed, in
      youth than in old age. What is useful on all or most occasions is
      more to be esteemed than what is useful only now and then; <i>e.g.</i>,
      justice and moderation, as compared with courage: also that which
      being possessed by every one, the other would not be required; <i>e.g.</i>,
      justice is better than courage, for, if every one were just,
      courage would not be required.<a name="FnAnchor9_134" href="#Footnote9_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a> </p>

    <p> Among two subjects the more desirable is that of which the
      generation or acquirement is more desirable; that of which the
      destruction or the loss is more to be deplored; that which is
      nearer or more like to the <i>Summum Bonum</i> or to that which
      is better than itself (unless indeed the resemblance be upon the
      ridiculous side, in the nature of a caricature, as the ape is to
      man<a name="FnAnchor9_135" href="#Footnote9_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a>);

      that which is the more conspicuous; the more difficult to attain;
      the more special and peculiar; the more entirely removed from all
      bad accompaniments; that which we can best share with friends;
      that which we wish to do to our friends, rather than to ordinary
      strangers (<i>e.g.</i>, doing justice or conferring benefit, than
      seeming to do so; for towards our friends we prefer doing this in
      reality, while towards strangers we prefer seeming to do so<a name="FnAnchor9_136" href="#Footnote9_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a>);

      that which we cannot obtain from others, as compared with that
      which can be hired; that which is unconditionally desirable, as
      compared with that which is desirable only when we have something
      else along with it; that of which the absence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>is
      a ground of just reproach against us and ought to make us ashamed;<a name="FnAnchor9_137" href="#Footnote9_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a>

    <p> Among many other <i>loci</i>, applicable to this same question
      of comparative excellence between two different subjects, one more
      will suffice here. You must distinguish the various ends in
      relation to which any given subject is declared to be eligible:
      the advantageous, the beautiful, the agreeable. That which
      conduces to all the three is more eligible than that which
      conduces to one or two of them only. If there be two subjects,
      both of them conducive to the same end among the three, you must
      examine which of them conduces to it most. Again, that which
      conduces to the better end (<i>e.g.</i>, to virtue rather than to
      pleasure) is the more eligible. The like comparison may be applied
      to the <i>Fugienda</i> as well as to the <i>Expetenda</i>. That
      is most to be avoided which shuts us out most from the desirable
      acquisitions: <i>e.g.</i>, sickness is more to be avoided than
      ungraceful form; for sickness shuts us out more completely both
      from virtue and from pleasure.<a name="FnAnchor9_141" href="#Footnote9_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a></p>

      not by nature; that which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>makes the subject to which it is

    <p> The <i>loci</i> just enumerated are Universal, and applicable
      to the debate of theses propounded in universal terms; but they
      will also be applicable, if the thesis propounded be a Particular
      proposition. </p>
    <p> If you prove the universal affirmative, you will at the same
      time prove the particular; if you prove the universal negative,
      you prove the particular negative also. The universal <i>loci</i>
      from Opposites, from Conjugates, from Inflections, will be alike
      applicable to particular propositions. Thus, if we look at the
      universal <i>locus</i> from Contraries, If all pleasure is good,
      then all pain is evil, — this will apply also to the particular,
      If some pleasure is good, then some pain is evil: in the
      particular as in the universal form the proposition is alike an <i>Endox</i>
      or conformable to common received opinion. The like may be said
      about the <i>loci</i> from <i>Habitus</i> and <i>Privatio</i>;
      also about those from Generation and Destruction;<a name="FnAnchor9_144" href="#Footnote9_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a>
      again, from More, Less, and Equally — this last, however, with
      some restriction, for the <i>locus</i> from Less will serve only
      for proving an affirmative. Thus, if some capacity is a less good
      than science, while yet some capacity is a good, then, <i>à
        fortiori</i>, some science is a good. But, if you take the same
      <i>locus</i> in the negative and say that the capacity is a good,
      you will not be warranted in saying, for that reason, that no
      science is a good.<a name="FnAnchor9_145" href="#Footnote9_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a> You may apply this same <i>locus</i>
      from Less to compare, not merely two subjects in different genera,
      but also two subjects of different degrees under the same genus.
      Thus, let the thesis be, Some science or cognition is a good. You
      will disprove this thesis, if you can show that prudence
      (&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;) is not a good; for, if prudence, which in common
      opinion is most confidently held to be a good, be really not so,
      you may argue that, <i>à fortiori</i> no other science can be so.
      Again, let the thesis be propounded with the assumption that, if
      it can be proved true or false in any one case, it shall be
      accepted as true or false in all universally (for example, that,
      if the human soul is immortal, all other souls are immortal also;
      or if not that, then none of the others): evidently, the
      propounder of such a thesis extends the particular into an
      universal. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>If

      he propounds his thesis affirmatively, you must try to prove the
      negative in some particular case; for this, under the conditions
      supposed, will be equivalent to proving an universal negative. If,
      on the other hand, he puts his thesis negatively, you will try to
      prove some particular affirmative; which (always under the given
      conditions) will carry the universal affirmative also.<a name="FnAnchor9_146" href="#Footnote9_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a></p>

    <p> Suppose the respondent to propound his thesis indefinitely, not
      carrying the indication either of universal or particular; <i>e.g.</i>,
      Pleasure is good. This can be proved by showing either that all
      pleasure is good, or that some pleasure is good; while it can be
      refuted only through the universal negative — by showing that no
      pleasure is good.<a name="FnAnchor9_147" href="#Footnote9_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a> But, if the thesis be divested of
      its indefinite character and propounded either as universal or as
      particular, there will then be two distinct ways of refuting it.
      If it be farther specialized — <i>e.g.</i>, One pleasure only is
      good — there will be three ways of refuting: you may show either
      that all pleasures are good; or that no pleasure is good; or that
      more pleasures than one are good. If the proposition be
      specialized farther still — <i>e.g.</i>, Prudence alone among all
      the virtues is science, — there are four lines of argument open
      for refuting it: you may prove either that all virtue is science;
      or that no virtue is science; or that some other virtue (such as
      justice) is science; or that prudence is not science.<a name="FnAnchor9_148" href="#Footnote9_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a></p>

    <p> In dealing with a particular proposition as thesis, still other
      <i>loci</i> already indicated for dealing with universal
      propositions will be available. You will run through the
      particulars comprised in the subject, distributed into genera and
      species. When you have produced a number of particulars
      successively to establish the universal, affirmative or negative,
      you are warranted in calling on the respondent either to admit the
      universal, or to produce on his side some adverse particular.<a name="FnAnchor9_149" href="#Footnote9_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
      You will also (as was before recommended) distribute the predicate
      of the thesis into the various species which it comprehends. If no
      one of these species be truly affirmable of the subject, then
      neither can the genus be truly affirmable; so that you will have
      refuted the thesis, supposing it to be affirmative. If, on the
      contrary, any one of the species be truly affirmable of the
      subject, then the genus will also be truly affirmable; so that you
      will have refuted <span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>the thesis, supposing it to be
      negative. Thus, if the thesis propounded be, The soul is a number:
      you divide number into its two species, odd and even, and prove
      that the soul is neither odd nor even; wherefore, it is not a
      number.<a name="FnAnchor9_150" href="#Footnote9_150"><span class="sp">150</span></a></p>

      applicable to propositions of Genus and of Proprium. Neither Genus
      nor Proprium is often made subject of debate as such; but both of

    <p> When the thesis propounded affirms that A is genus of B, you
      will run over all the cognates of B, and see whether there is any
      one among them respecting which A cannot be affirmed as genus. If
      there be, this is a good argument against the thesis; for the
      genus ought to be predicable of all. Next, whether what is really
      no more than an accident is affirmed as genus, which ought to
      belong to the essence of the subject. Perhaps (<i>e.g.</i>) white
      is affirmed in the thesis as being genus of snow; but white cannot
      be truly so affirmed; for it is not of the essence of snow, but is
      only a quality or accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_152" href="#Footnote9_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a> Examine
      whether the predicate A comes under the definition already given
      of an Accident, — that which may or may not be predicated of the
      subject; also, whether A and B both fall under the same one out of
      the ten Categories or Predicaments. If B the subject comes under <i>Essentia</i>,
      or <i>Quale</i>, or <i>Ad Aliquid</i>, the predicate ought also
      to belong to <i>Essentia</i>, or <i>Quale</i>, or <i>Ad Aliquid</i>:
      the species and the genus ought to come under the same Category.<a name="FnAnchor9_153" href="#Footnote9_153"><span class="sp">153</span></a>
      If this be not the case in a thesis of Genus, the thesis cannot be
      maintained.</p>

    <p> You are aware that the species always partakes of the genus,
      while the genus never partakes of the species; to <i>partake</i>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>meaning

      that the species includes the essence or definition of the genus,
      but the genus never includes the essence or definition of the
      species. You will examine, therefore, whether in the thesis
      propounded to you this condition is realized; if not, the thesis
      may be refuted. Suppose, <i>e.g.</i>, that it enunciates some
      superior genus as including <i>Ens</i> or <i>Unum</i>. If this
      were true, the genus so assigned would still partake of <i>Ens</i>
      and <i>Unum</i>; for <i>Ens</i> and <i>Unum</i> maybe
      predicated of all existences whatever. Therefore what is
      enunciated in the thesis as a genus, cannot be a real genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_154" href="#Footnote9_154"><span class="sp">154</span></a></p>

    <p> Perhaps you may find something respecting which the subject
      (species) may be truly affirmed, while the predicate (genus)
      cannot be truly affirmed. If so, the predicate is not a real
      genus. Thus, the thesis may enunciate <i>Ens</i> or <i>Scibile</i>
      as being the genus of <i>Opinabile</i>. But this last, the
      species or subject <i>Opinabile</i>, may be affirmed respecting <i>Non-Ens</i>
      also; while the predicates <i>Ens</i> or <i>Scibile</i> (given
      as the pretended genus of <i>Opinabile</i>) cannot be affirmed
      respecting <i>Non-Ens</i>. You can thus show that <i>Ens</i> or
      <i>Scibile</i> is not the real genus of <i>Opinabile</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_155" href="#Footnote9_155"><span class="sp">155</span></a>
      The pretended species <i>Opinabile</i> (comprising as it does
      both <i>Ens</i> and <i>Non-Ens</i>) stretches farther than the
      pretended genus <i>Ens</i> or <i>Scibile</i>: whereas every real
      genus ought to stretch farther than any one or any portion of its
      constituent species.<a name="FnAnchor9_156" href="#Footnote9_156"><span class="sp">156</span></a> The thesis may thus be overthrown,
      if there be any one species which stretches even equally far or is

    <p> It is a general truth that the same species cannot belong to two
      distinct genera, unless one of the two be subordinate to the
      other, or unless both of them be comprehended under some common
      higher genus. You will examine, therefore, whether there is any
      other genus, besides the predicate of the thesis, to which the
      subject of the thesis can be referred. If there be some other
      genus, not under either of the two conditions above indicated, the
      predicate enunciated by the thesis cannot be the real genus of the
      subject. Thus, if the thesis declares justice to be science (or to
      belong to the genus science), you may remark that there is another
      distinct genus (virtue) to which justice also belongs. In this
      particular case, however, it would be replied that science and
      virtue can both be referred to one and the same higher genus,
      viz., habit and disposition. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span> the thesis, Justice
      is science, will not be truly open to objection on this ground.<a name="FnAnchor9_158" href="#Footnote9_158"><span class="sp">158</span></a></p>

    <p> Again, if the predicate of the thesis be the true genus of the
      subject, all the higher genera in which the predicate is contained
      must also be predicated <i>in Quid</i> (as the predicate itself
      is<span class="correction" title="')' omitted in 2nd edition">)</span>
      respecting the subject. This you must show by an induction of
      particular instances, no counter-instance being producible.<a name="FnAnchor9_159" href="#Footnote9_159"><span class="sp">159</span></a>
      If the thesis enunciated does not conform to this condition, you
      will have a good argument against it. You will also run over the
      sub-species that are comprehended in the subject of the thesis,
      considered as a genus; and you will examine whether the predicate
      of the thesis (together with all its superior genera) is
      predicable essentially or <i>in Quid</i> of all these
      sub-species. If you can find any one among these sub-species, of
      which it is not essentially predicable, the predicate of the
      thesis is not the true genus of the subject;<a name="FnAnchor9_160" href="#Footnote9_160"><span class="sp">160</span></a>
      the like also, if the definitions of those genera are not

    <p> Perhaps the thesis may enunciate as a genus what is really
      nothing more than a differentia. It may also enunciate the
      differentia either as a part of the genus or as a part of the
      species; or it may enunciate the genus either as a part of the
      differentia or as a part of the species. All these are attackable.
      The differentia is not a genus, nor does it respond to the
      question <i>Quid est</i>, but to the question <i>Quale quid est</i>.
      It is always either <span class="correction" title="amended from
        'more more'">more</span> extensive than the species, or
      co-extensive therewith.<a name="FnAnchor9_162" href="#Footnote9_162"><span class="sp">162</span></a> If none of
      the differentiæ belonging to a genus can be predicated of a
      species, neither can the genus itself be predicated thereof. Thus,
      neither odd nor even can be predicated of the soul; accordingly,
      neither can the genus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>(number) be predicated of the soul.<a name="FnAnchor9_163" href="#Footnote9_163"><span class="sp">163</span></a>
      If the species be <i>prius naturâ</i>, so that when it disappears
      the enunciated genus disappears along with it, this cannot be the
      real genus; nor, if the enunciated genus or differentia can be
      supposed to disappear and yet the species does not disappear along
      with them.<a name="FnAnchor9_164" href="#Footnote9_164"><span class="sp">164</span></a> If the species partakes of (includes
      in its essence) something contrary to the enunciated genus, this
      last cannot be the real genus; nor, if the species includes
      something which cannot possibly belong to what is in that genus.
      Thus, if the soul partakes of (or includes in its essence) life,
      and if no number can possibly live, the soul cannot be a species
      of number.<a name="FnAnchor9_165" href="#Footnote9_165"><span class="sp">165</span></a></p>

    <p> Again, the generic term and the specific term ought to be
      univocal in signification. You must examine (according to the
      tests indicated in the First Book of the Topica) whether it be
      taken equivocally in the thesis. If it be so, you have a ground of
      attack, and also if it be taken metaphorically; for every genus
      ought to be enunciated in the proper sense of the term, and no
      metaphor can be allowed to pass as a genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_166" href="#Footnote9_166"><span class="sp">166</span></a> Note

    <p> Several <i>loci</i> are furnished by Contraries, either to the
      species or the genus. If there be something contrary to the
      species, but nothing contrary to the genus, then that which is
      contrary to the species ought to be included under the same genus
      as the species itself; but, if there be something contrary to the
      species, and also something contrary to the genus, then that which
      is contrary to the species ought to be included in that which is
      contrary to the genus. Each of these doctrines you will have to
      make good by induction of particular cases.<a name="FnAnchor9_168" href="#Footnote9_168"><span class="sp">168</span></a> If that
      which is contrary to the species be a genus itself (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>bonum</i>)
      and not included in any superior genus, then the like will be true
      respecting the species itself: it will not be included in any
      genus; and the predicate of the thesis will not be a true genus. <i>Bonum</i>
      and <i>malum</i> are not included in any common superior genus;
      each is a genus <i>per se</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_169" href="#Footnote9_169"><span class="sp">169</span></a> Or suppose
      that the subject (species) of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>the thesis, and the
      predicate (genus) of the thesis, have both of them contraries; but
      that in the one there is an intermediate between the two
      contraries, and in the other, not. This shows that the predicate
      cannot be the true genus of the species; for, wherever there is an
      intermediate between the two contraries of the species, there also
      is an intermediate between the two contraries of the genus; and <i>vice

        versâ</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_170" href="#Footnote9_170"><span class="sp">170</span></a> If there be an intermediate between
      the two contraries of the species, and also an intermediate
      between the two contraries of the genus, you will examine whether
      both intermediates are of like nature, designated by analogous
      terms. If it be not so (if, <i>e.g.</i>, the one intermediate is
      designated by a positive term, and the other only by a negative
      term), you will have ground for contending against the thesis,
      that the predicate enunciated therein is not the true genus of the
      subject. At any rate, this is a probable (&#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#957;) dialectical
      argument — to insist upon analogy between the two intermediates;
      though there are some particular cases in which the doctrine does
      not hold.<a name="FnAnchor9_171" href="#Footnote9_171"><span class="sp">171</span></a></p>

    <p> Again, suppose different conditions: that there is no contrary
      to the genus, but that there is a contrary to the species. You
      will examine whether not merely the contrary of the species, but
      also the intermediate between its two contraries, is included in
      the same genus; for, if the two contraries are included therein,
      the intermediate ought also to be included. This is a line of
      argument <i>probable</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, conformable to general
      presumption, and recommendable in a dialectical debate), though
      there are not wanting examples adverse to it: thus, excess and
      defect are included in the same genus evil, but the moderate or
      measured (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;) is not in the genus evil, but in the genus
      good.<a name="FnAnchor9_172" href="#Footnote9_172"><span class="sp">172</span></a> We must remark, moreover, that
      though it be a probable dialectical argument, that, wherever the
      genus has a contrary, the species will also have a contrary, yet
      there are cases adverse to this principle. Thus, sickness in
      general has for its contrary health in general; but particular
      species of sickness (such as fever, ophthalmia, gout, &amp;c.)
      have no contrary.<a name="FnAnchor9_173" href="#Footnote9_173"><span class="sp">173</span></a></p>

    <p> Such will be your way of procedure, if the thesis propounded be
      Affirmative, and if you have to make out a negative against it.
      But if, on the contrary, the thesis be Negative, so that you have
      to make out an affirmative against it, you have then three <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>lines

      of procedure open. 1. The genus may have no contrary, while the
      species has a contrary: in that case, you may perhaps be able to
      show that the contrary of the species (subject) is included in the
      predicate of the thesis (genus); if so, then the species also will
      be included therein. 2. Or, if you can show that the intermediate
      between the species and its contrary is included in the predicate
      (genus), then that same genus will also include the species and
      its contrary; for, wherever the intermediate is, there also are
      the two extremes between which it is intermediate. 3. Lastly, if
      the genus has a contrary as well as the species, you may be able
      to show that the contrary of the species is included in the
      contrary of the genus; assuming which to be the case, then the
      species itself will be included in the genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_174" href="#Footnote9_174"><span class="sp">174</span></a>

    <p> If the genus enunciated by the thesis be a true one, all the
      Derivatives and Collaterals of the predicate will be fit and
      suitable for those of the subject. Thus, if justice be a sort of
      science, justly will be scientifically, and the just man will be a
      scientific man. This <i>locus</i> is useful to be kept in mind,
      whether you have to make out an affirmative or a negative.<a name="FnAnchor9_175" href="#Footnote9_175"><span class="sp">175</span></a>
      You may reason in the same way about the <i>Analoga</i> of the
      predicate and the subject; about the productive and destructive
      causes of each; the manifestations present, past, and future, of
      each, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchor9_176" href="#Footnote9_176"><span class="sp">176</span></a></p>

    <p> When the opposite of the species (subject) is Privative, the
      thesis will be open to attack in two ways. 1. If the privative
      opposite be contained in the predicate, the subject itself will
      not be contained therein; for it is a general truth that a subject
      and its privative opposite are never both of them contained in the
      same lowest genus: thus, if vision is sensible perception,
      blindness is not sensible perception. 2. If both the species and
      the genus have privative opposites, then if the privative opposite
      of the species be contained in the privative opposite of the
      genus, the species itself will also be contained in the genus; if
      not, not. Thus, if blindness be an inability of sensible
      perception, vision will be a sensible perception. This last <i>locus</i>
      will be available, whether you are making out an affirmative or a
      negative.<a name="FnAnchor9_177" href="#Footnote9_177"><span class="sp">177</span></a></p>

    <p> If the predicate of the thesis be a true genus, you may convert
      the thesis simply, having substituted for the predicate the denial
      of its Contradictory; if not, not. <i>Vice versâ</i>, if the new
      proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
      so formed be true, the predicate of the thesis will be a true
      genus; if not, not. Thus, if good be the true genus of
      pleasurable, nothing that is not good will be pleasurable. This <i>locus</i>
      also will serve both for making out an affirmative and for making
      out a negative.<a name="FnAnchor9_178" href="#Footnote9_178"><span class="sp">178</span></a></p>

    <p> If the subject (species) of the thesis be a Relative, you will
      examine whether the predicate (genus) be relative also; if not, it
      will not be the true genus of the subject. The converse of this
      rule, however, will not hold; and indeed the rule itself is not
      absolutely universal.<a name="FnAnchor9_179" href="#Footnote9_179"><span class="sp">179</span></a> You may also argue that, if the
      correlate of the genus be not the same as the correlate of the
      species, the genus cannot be truly predicated of that species:
      thus, half is the correlate of double, but half is not the proper
      correlate of multiple; therefore, multiple is not the true genus
      of double. But your argument may here be met by contradictory
      instances; thus, cognition has reference to the <i>cognitum</i>,
      but <i>habitus</i> and <i>dispositio</i> (the genera to which <i>cognitio</i>
      belongs) do not refer to <i>cognitum</i> but to <i>anima</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_180" href="#Footnote9_180"><span class="sp">180</span></a>
      You may also examine whether the correlate, when applied to the
      genus, is put in the same case (<i>e.g.</i>, genitive, dative,
      &amp;c.) as when it is applied to the species: if it be put into a
      different case, this affords presumption that the genus is not a
      true genus; though here again instances may be produced showing
      that your presumption will not hold universally. Farther, you will
      observe whether the correlates thus similarly inflected
      reciprocate like the species and genus; if not, this will furnish
      you with the same adverse presumption.<a name="FnAnchor9_181" href="#Footnote9_181"><span class="sp">181</span></a></p>

    <p> Again, examine whether the correlate of the genus is genus to
      the correlate of the species; if it be not so, you may argue that
      the genus is not truly predicated. Thus, if the thesis affirms
      that <i>perceptio</i> is the genus of <i>cognitio</i>, it will
      follow that <i>percipibile</i> is the genus of <i>cognoscibile</i>.
      Now this cannot be maintained; for there are some <i>cognoscibilia</i>
      which are not perceivable, <i>e.g.</i>, some <i>cogitabilia</i>
      (<i>intelligibilia</i>, &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#940;). Since therefore <i>percipibile</i>
      is not the true genus of <i>cognoscibile</i>, neither can <i>perceptio</i>
      be the true genus of <i>cognitio</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_182" href="#Footnote9_182"><span class="sp">182</span></a></p>

      <p> We must take note here of the large sense in which Aristotle
        uses &#7944;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; — <i>Opposita</i>, including as one of the
        four varieties <i>Relata</i> and <i>Correlata</i> = <i>Relativé-Opposita</i>
        (to use a technical word familiar in logical manuals). I have
        before (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#page105">p.
          105</a>) remarked the inconvenience of calling the Relative <i>opposite</i>
        to its Correlate; and have observed that it is logically
        incorrect to treat <i>Relata</i> as a species or mode of the
        genus <i>Opposita</i>. The reverse would be more correct: we
        ought to rank <i>Opposita</i> or a species or mode under the
        genus <i>Relata</i>. Since Aristotle numbers <i>Relata</i>
        among the ten Categories, he ought to have seen that it cannot
        be included as a subordinate under any superior genus.</p>
    </div>
    <p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>Suppose

      the thesis predicates of memory that it is — a continuance of
      cognition. This will be open to attack, if the predicate be
      affirmed as the genus (or even as the accident) of the subject.
      For every continuance must be <i>in</i> that which continues. But
      memory is of necessity <i>in</i> the soul; it cannot therefore be
      <i>in</i> cognition.<a name="FnAnchor9_183" href="#Footnote9_183"><span class="sp">183</span></a> There is another ground on which the
      thesis will be assailable, if it defines memory to be — a habit or
      acquirement retentive of belief. This will not hold, because it
      confounds habit or disposition with act; which last is the true
      description of memory. The opposite error will be committed if the
      respondent defines perceptivity to be a — movement through or by
      means of the body. Here perceptivity, which is a habit or
      disposition, is ranked under movement, which is the act exercising
      the same, <i>i.e.</i>, perceptivity in actual exercise.<a name="FnAnchor9_184" href="#Footnote9_184"><span class="sp">184</span></a>
      Or, the mistake may be made of ranking some habit or disposition
      under the power consequent on the possession thereof, as if this
      power were the superior genus: thus the respondent may define
      gentleness to be a continence of anger; courage, a continence of
      fears; justice, a continence of appetite of lucre. But the genus
      here assigned is not a good one: for a man who feels no anger is
      called gentle; a man who feels no fear is called courageous;
      whereas the continent man is he who feels anger or fear, but
      controls them. Such controlling power is a natural consequence of
      gentleness and courage, insomuch that, if the gentle man happened
      to feel anger, or the courageous man to feel fear, each would
      control these impulses; but it is no part of the essence thereof,
      and therefore cannot be the genus under which they fall.<a name="FnAnchor9_185" href="#Footnote9_185"><span class="sp">185</span></a>
      A like mistake is made if pain be predicated as the genus of
      anger, or supposition as the genus of belief. The angry man
      doubtless feels pain, but his pain precedes his anger in time, and
      is the antecedent cause thereof; now the genus can never precede
      its species in time. So also a man may have the same supposition
      sometimes with belief, sometimes without it; accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
      supposition cannot be the genus of belief any more than the same
      animal can be sometimes a man, sometimes a brute.<a name="FnAnchor9_186" href="#Footnote9_186"><span class="sp">186</span></a>
      And indeed the same negative conclusion would follow, even if we
      granted that every supposition was always attended with belief.
      For, in that case, supposition and belief would be co-extensive
      terms; but the generic term must always be more extensive than its
      specific.<a name="FnAnchor9_187" href="#Footnote9_187"><span class="sp">187</span></a></p>

        Waitz, in his notes (p. 478), says that Aristotle is here in the
        wrong. But I do not agree with Waitz. Aristotle considers &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;
        to be an accidental accompaniment of &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;, not a species
        thereof. It may be present or absent without determining any new
        specific name to &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;, which term has reference only to the
        intellectual or conceptive part of the mental supposition. At
        least there seems to be nothing contradictory or erroneous in
        what Aristotle here says, though he does not adhere everywhere

    <p> You will farther examine whether the predicate of the thesis be
      of a nature to inhere in the same substance as the subject. If it
      be not, it cannot be truly predicated thereof, either as genus or
      even as accident. White (species) and colour (genus) are of a
      nature to inhere or belong to the same substance. But, if the
      thesis declares that shame is a species of fear, or that anger is
      a species of pain, you may impugn it on the ground that shame
      belongs to the reasoning element in man, fear to the courageous or
      energetic element; and that pain belongs to the appetitive
      element, anger to the courageous. This proves that fear can
      neither be the genus nor the accident of shame; that pain can
      neither be the genus nor the accident of anger.<a name="FnAnchor9_188" href="#Footnote9_188"><span class="sp">188</span></a></p>

        Ibid. p. 126, a. 3-16. Compare V. iv. p. 133, a. 31. Aristotle
        appears here to recognize the Platonic doctrine as laid down in
        the Republic and Timæus, asserting either three distinct parts
        of the soul, or, rather, three distinct souls. In the treatise
        De Animâ (III. ix. p. 432, a. 25; I. v. p. 411, b. 25), he
        dissents from and impugns this same doctrine.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Suppose the thesis declares that animal is a species under the
      genus <i>visibile</i> or <i>percepibile</i>. You may oppose it
      by pointing out that animal is only <i>visibile secundum quid</i>,
      or partially; that is, only so far as regards body, not as regards
      mind. But the species always partakes of its genus wholly, not
      partially or <i>secundum quid</i>; thus, man is not partially
      animal, but wholly or essentially animal. If what is predicated as
      the genus be not thus essentially partaken, it cannot be a true
      genus; hence neither <i>visibile</i> nor <i>percepibile</i> is a
      true genus of animal.<a name="FnAnchor9_189" href="#Footnote9_189"><span class="sp">189</span></a></p>

    <p> Sometimes what is predicated as the genus is, when compared to
      its species, only as a part to the whole; which is never the case
      with a true genus. Some refer animal to the genus living body; but
      body is only part of the whole animal, and therefore cannot be the
      true genus thereof.<a name="FnAnchor9_190" href="#Footnote9_190"><span class="sp">190</span></a> Sometimes a species which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>is
      blameworthy and hateful, or a species which is praiseworthy and
      eligible, may be referred to the power or capacity from which it
      springs, as genus; thus, the thief, a blameworthy and hateful
      character, may be referred to the predicate — capable of stealing
      another man’s property. But this, though true as a predicate, is
      not the true genus; for the honest man is also capable of so
      acting, but he is distinguished from the thief by not acting so,
      nor having the disposition so to act. All power and capacity is
      eligible; if the above were the true genus of thief, it would be a
      case in which power and capacity is blameworthy and hateful.
      Neither, on the other hand, can any thing in its own nature
      praiseworthy and eligible, be referred to power and capacity as
      its genus; for all power and capacity is praiseworthy and eligible
      not in itself or its own nature, but by reason of something else,
      namely, its realizable consequences.<a name="FnAnchor9_191" href="#Footnote9_191"><span class="sp">191</span></a></p>

      <p> The general drift of Aristotle is here illustrated better by
        taking the thief separately, apart from the other two. But we
        must notice here the proof of his temper or judgment concerning
        the persons called Sophists, when we find him grouping them in
        the bunch of &#968;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8048; and &#966;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#8048; along with thieves. The majority
        of his uninstructed contemporaries would probably have agreed in
        this judgment, but they would certainly have enrolled Aristotle
        himself among the Sophists thus depreciated.</p>

    <p> Again, you may detect in the thesis sometimes the mistake of
      putting under one genus a species which properly comes under two
      genera conjointly, not subalternate one to the other; sometimes,
      the mistake of predicating the genus as a differentia, or the
      differentia as a genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_192" href="#Footnote9_192"><span class="sp">192</span></a> Sometimes,
      also, the subject in which the attribute or affection resides is
      predicated as if it were the genus of such affection; or, <i>è
        converso</i>, the attribute or affection is predicated as the
      genus of the subject wherein it resides; <i>e.g.</i>, when breath
      or wind, which is really a movement of air, is affirmed to be air
      put in motion, and thus constituted as a species under the genus
      air; or when snow is declared to be water congelated; or mud, to
      be earth mixed with moisture.<a name="FnAnchor9_193" href="#Footnote9_193"><span class="sp">193</span></a> In none of
      these cases is the predicate a true genus; for it cannot be always
      affirmed of the subject. </p>

    <p> Or perhaps the predicate affirmed as genus may be no genus at
      all; for nothing can be a genus unless there are species contained
      under it; <i>e.g.</i>, if the thesis declare white to be a genus,
      this may be impugned, because white objects do not differ <i>in
        specie</i> from each other. Or a mere universal predicate (such
      as <i>Ens</i> or <i>Unum</i>) may be put forward as a genus or
      differentia; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>or

    <p> Perhaps it may happen that the subject (species) and the
      predicate (genus) of the thesis may each have a contrary term; and
      that in each pair of contrary terms one may be better, the other
      worse. If, in that case, the better species be referred to the
      worse genus, or <i>vice versâ</i>, this will render the thesis
      assailable. Or perhaps the species may be fit to be referred
      equally to both the contrary genera; in which case, if the thesis
      should refer it to the worse of the two, that will be a ground of
      objection. Thus, if the soul be referred to the genus <i>mobile</i>,
      you are at liberty to object that it is equally referable to the
      genus <i>stabile</i>: and that, as the latter is the better of
      the two, it ought to be referred to the better in preference to
      the worse.<a name="FnAnchor9_195" href="#Footnote9_195"><span class="sp">195</span></a> </p>

    <p> There is a <i>locus</i> of More and Less, which may be made
      available in various ways. Thus, if the genus predicated admits of
      being graduated as more or less, while the species of which it is
      predicated does not admit of such graduation, you may question the
      applicability of the genus to the species.<a name="FnAnchor9_196" href="#Footnote9_196"><span class="sp">196</span></a> You may
      raise the question also, if there be any thing else which looks
      equally like the true genus, or more like it than the genus
      predicated by the thesis. This will happen often, when the essence
      of the species includes several distinct elements; <i>e.g.</i>,
      in the essence of anger, there is included both pain (an emotional
      element), and the supposition or belief of being undervalued (an
      intellectual element); hence, if the thesis ranks anger under the
      genus pain, you may object that it equally belongs to the genus
      supposition<a name="FnAnchor9_197" href="#Footnote9_197"><span class="sp">197</span></a> This <i>locus</i> is useful for
      raising a negative question, but will serve little for
      establishing an affirmative. Towards the affirmative, you will
      find advantage in examining the subject (species) respecting which
      the thesis predicates a given genus; for, if it can be shown that
      this supposed species is no real species but a genus, the genus
      predicated thereof will be <i>à fortiori</i> a genus.<a name="FnAnchor9_198" href="#Footnote9_198"><span class="sp">198</span></a></p>

      Differentia as well as Genus is predicated essentially respecting
      the Species. Accordingly, Genus must be discriminated from
      Differentia. For such discrimination<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span> the following
      characteristics are pointed out:— 1. Genus has greater extent in
      predication than Differentia. 2. In replying to the enquiry, <i>Quid

        est?</i> it is more suitable and significant to declare the
      Genus than the Differentia. 3. Differentia declares a quality of
      Genus, and therefore presupposes Genus as already known; but Genus
      does not in like manner presuppose Differentia. If you wish to
      show that belief is the genus to which cognition belongs, you must
      examine whether the <i>cognoscens</i> believes <i>quâ cognoscens</i>.

    <p> Wherever a predicate is universally true of its subject, while
      the proposition is not true if simply converted (<i>i.e.</i>,
      wherever the predicate is of larger extension than the subject),
      there is difficulty in distinguishing it from a genus.
      Accordingly, when you are respondent, maintaining the affirmative
      side, you will use such predicate as if it were a genus; but, when
      you are assailant, you will not allow the respondent to do so. You
      may quote against him the instance of <i>Non-Ens</i>; which is
      predicable of every thing generated, but which is not a genus,

    <h2>V.</h2>
    <p> Aristotle passes, in the Fifth book of the Topica, to those
      debates in which the thesis set up declares the predicate as
      Proprium of the subject. </p>
    <p> A Proprium may belong to its subject either <i>per se</i> and <i>semper</i>,
      or relatively to something else and occasionally or sometimes. It
      is a proprium <i>per se</i> of man to be an animal by nature
      tractable. It is a relative proprium of the soul in regard to the
      body, to exercise command; of the body in regard to the soul, to
      obey command. It is a proprium <i>semper</i> of a god, to be
      immortal; it is an occasional <i>proprium</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
      sometimes) of this or that man, to be walking in the market-place.<a name="FnAnchor9_202" href="#Footnote9_202"><span class="sp">202</span></a>
      When the proprium is set out relatively to something else, the
      debate must involve two questions, and may involve four. Thus, if
      the thesis affirms that it is a proprium of man relatively to
      horse (discriminating man from horse) to be by nature two-footed,
      you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>may

      (as opponent) either deny that man is two-footed, or affirm that
      horse is two-footed; or you may go farther and affirm that man is
      by nature four-footed, or deny that horse is by nature
      four-footed. If you can succeed in showing any one of these four,
      you will have refuted the thesis.<a name="FnAnchor9_203" href="#Footnote9_203"><span class="sp">203</span></a></p>

        as what he calls specially the <i>relative</i> Proprium. The

        everything else; the <i>relative</i> Proprium discriminates it

    <p> The Proprium <i>per se</i> discriminates its subject from

      subject. The relative Proprium may be either constant and
      universally true, or true with exceptions — true and applicable in
      the ordinary course of things: it may be tested through those <i>Loci</i>
      which have been enumerated as applicable to the Accident. The

        &#963;&#965;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#943;. The distinctions in this paragraph are not
        very sharply drawn.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Aristotle distinguishes (1) those cases in which the alleged
      proprium is a true proprium, but is incorrectly or informally set
      out in the thesis, from those (2) in which it is untruly
      predicated, or is no proprium at all.</p>
    <p> To set out a proprium well, that which is predicated ought to be
      clearer and better known than the subject of which it is
      predicated, since the purpose of predicating the proprium is to
      communicate knowledge.<a name="FnAnchor9_205" href="#Footnote9_205"><span class="sp">205</span></a> If it be
      more obscure or less known, you may impugn the thesis as bad in
      form, or badly set out. Thus, if the thesis declare, as a proprium
      of fire, that fire is of all things the most like to the soul,
      this is not well set out, because the essence of the soul is not
      so well known as the essence of fire. Moreover, the fact that the
      predicate belongs to the subject, ought to be better known even
      than the subject itself; for whoever is ignorant that A belongs to
      B at all, cannot possibly know that A is the proprium of B.<a name="FnAnchor9_206" href="#Footnote9_206"><span class="sp">206</span></a>
      Thus, if the thesis declare, as proprium of fire, that it is the
      first or most universal subject in which it is the nature of soul
      to be found, the predicate is here doubly unknowable: first, the
      hearer does not know that the soul is found in fire at all; next,
      he does not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>know

      that fire is the <i>first</i> subject in which soul is found. On
      the other hand, the respondent will repel your attack if he can
      show that his proprium is more knowable in both the two
      above-mentioned ways. If, for example, he declares as thesis, To
      have sensible perception is the proprium of an animal, here the
      proprium is both well known in itself, and well known as belonging
      to the given subject. Accordingly, it is well set out, as far as
      this condition is concerned.<a name="FnAnchor9_207" href="#Footnote9_207"><span class="sp">207</span></a></p>

    <p> A second condition of its being well set out is, that it shall
      contain neither equivocal term nor equivocal or amphibolical
      proposition. Thus, if the thesis declares, To perceive is the
      proprium of an animal, it is equivocal; for it may mean either to
      have sensible perception, or to exercise sensible perception
      actually. You may apply the test to such a thesis, by syllogizing
      from one or both of these equivocal meanings. The respondent will
      make good his defence, if he shows that there is no such
      equivocation: as, for example, if the thesis be, It is a proprium
      of fire to be the body most easily moved into the upper region;
      where there is no equivocation, either of term or proposition.<a name="FnAnchor9_208" href="#Footnote9_208"><span class="sp">208</span></a>
      Sometimes the equivocation may be, not in the name of the proprium
      itself, but in the name of the subject to which it is applied.
      Where this last is not <i>unum et simplex</i> but equivocal, the
      thesis must specify which among the several senses is intended;
      and, if that be neglected, the manner of setting out is incorrect.<a name="FnAnchor9_209" href="#Footnote9_209"><span class="sp">209</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> Another form of the like mistake is, where the same term is
      repeated both in the predicate and in the subject; which is often
      done, both as to Proprium and as to Definition, though it is a
      cause of obscurity, as well as a tiresome repetition.<a name="FnAnchor9_210" href="#Footnote9_210"><span class="sp">210</span></a>
      The repetition may be made in two ways: either directly, by the
      same term occurring twice; or indirectly, when the second term
      given is such that it cannot be defined without repeating the
      first. An example of direct repetition is, Fire is a <i>body</i>
      the rarest among <i>bodies</i> (for proprium of fire). An example
      of indirect repetition is, Earth is a <i>substance</i> which
      tends most of all <i>bodies</i> downwards to the lowest region
      (as proprium of earth); for, when the respondent is required to
      define <i>bodies</i>, he must define them — such and such <i>substances</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_211" href="#Footnote9_211"><span class="sp">211</span></a>
      An example free from objection on this ground is, Man is an animal
      capable of receiving cognition (as proprium of man). </p>

    </div>
    <p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>Another

      mode of bad or incorrect setting out is, when the term predicated
      as proprium belongs not only to the subject, but also to all other
      subjects. Such a proposition is useless; for it furnishes no means
      of discriminating the subject from anything; whereas
      discrimination is one express purpose of the Proprium as well as
      of the Definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_212" href="#Footnote9_212"><span class="sp">212</span></a> Again, another mode is, when the
      thesis declares several propria belonging to the same subject,
      without announcing that they are several. As the definer ought not
      to introduce into his definition any words beyond what are
      required for declaring the essence of the subject, so neither
      should the person who sets out a proprium add any words beyond
      those requisite for constituting the proprium. Thus, if the thesis
      enunciates, as proprium of fire, that it is the thinnest and
      lightest body, here are two propria instead of one. Contrast with
      this another proprium, free from the objection just pointed out —
      Moist is that which may assume every variety of figure.<a name="FnAnchor9_213" href="#Footnote9_213"><span class="sp">213</span></a></p>

    <p> A farther mistake is, when the predicate declaring the proprium
      includes either the subject itself or some species comprehended
      under the subject; for example, when we are told, as a proprium of
      animal, that animal is a substance of which man is a species. We
      have already seen that the proprium ought to be better known than
      its subject; but man is even less known (posterior in respect to
      cognition) than animal, because it is a species under the genus
      animal.<a name="FnAnchor9_214" href="#Footnote9_214"><span class="sp">214</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> Again, our canon — That the Proprium should be better known than
      its subject, or should make the subject better known — will be
      violated in another way, if the proprium enunciated be something
      opposite to the subject, or in any other way <i>simul naturâ</i>
      as compared with the subject; and still more, if it be <i>posterius

        naturâ</i> as compared with the subject. Thus, if a man
      enunciates, as proprium of good, that good is that which is most
      opposite to evil, his proprium will not be well or correctly set
      out.<a name="FnAnchor9_215" href="#Footnote9_215"><span class="sp">215</span></a></p>

        Ibid. p. 131, a. 12-26. This <i>locus</i> is not clear or
        satisfactory, as Alexander remarks in Scholia (p. 284, b. 12-23,
        Br.). He says that it may pass as an &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#957; — something
        sufficiently plausible to be employed in Dialectic. In fact,
        Alexander virtually controverts this <i>locus</i> in what he
        says a little farther down (Schol. p. 285, a. 31), that the
        Proprium is always <i>simul naturâ</i> with its subject.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Perhaps, again, the thesis may enunciate as proprium what is not
      constantly appurtenant to the subject, but is sometimes absent
      therefrom; or, intending to enunciate an occasional proprium, it
      may omit to specify the qualifying epithet <i>occasional</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>In
      either case the proprium is not well set out, and a ground is

    <p> Moreover, the proprium will not be well set out, if it be such
      as does not necessarily belong to the subject, but is only shown
      by the evidence of sense to belong thereunto. In this case, when
      the subject is out of the reach of sensible perception, no one
      knows whether the supposed proprium still continues as its
      attribute. Thus, suppose the thesis to enunciate as a proprium of
      the sun, that it is the brightest star borne in movement above the
      earth: the fact that it is so borne in movement above the earth is
      one that we know by sensible perception only; accordingly, after
      the sun sets and we cease to see it, we cannot be sure that it
      continues to be borne in movement. If a proprium knowable as such
      by sense be chosen, it ought to be one which is also knowable
      independently, as belonging to the subject by necessity. Thus, if
      a man enunciates, as proprium of superficies, that superficies is
      what first becomes coloured or first receives colour, this is a
      proprium well set out. For we know clearly that it must always
      belong to a superficies; though we may also obtain the additional
      evidence of sense, by looking at some perceivable body.<a name="FnAnchor9_217" href="#Footnote9_217"><span class="sp">217</span></a></p>

      <p> Aristotle means that we know clearly, <i>by evidence
          independent of sense</i>, that the superficies must be the
        first portion of the body that becomes coloured, though we may
        attain the additional evidence of our senses (<span class="gesp">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#941;&#967;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>)
        to the same fact.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Perhaps too the thesis may enunciate the Definition as if it
      were a Proprium; which is another ground for objecting that the
      proprium is not well set out. Thus, the thesis may enunciate, as
      proprium of man, that man is a land animal walking on two feet.
      Here what is given as proprium is the essence of man, which never
      ought to be affirmed in the proprium. To set out the proprium
      well, the predicate ought to reciprocate and to be co-extensive
      with the subject, but it ought not to affirm the essence thereof.
      A good specimen of proprium well set out is the following, Man is
      an animal by nature gentle; for here the predicate is co-extensive
      with the subject, yet does not declare the essence of the subject.<a name="FnAnchor9_218" href="#Footnote9_218"><span class="sp">218</span></a></p>

        Ibid. b. 37-p. 132, a. 9.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Lastly, the proprium, to be well set out, though it does not
      declare the essence of the subject, yet ought to begin by
      presupposing the generic portion of the essence, and to attach
      itself <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>thereunto

      as a constant adjunct or concomitant. Thus, suppose the thesis to
      enunciate, as proprium, Animal is that which has a soul; this will
      not be well set out, for the predicate is not superadded or
      attached to the declared generic essence of animal. But, if the
      thesis enunciates, as proprium of man, Man is an animal capable of
      acquiring cognition, — this will be a proprium well set out, so
      far as the present objection is concerned. For here the predicate
      declares first the generic essence of the subject, and then
      superinduces the peculiar adjunct thereupon.<a name="FnAnchor9_219" href="#Footnote9_219"><span class="sp">219</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> Thus far Aristotle has pointed out certain conditions to be
      attended to in determining whether a Proprium is well set out or
      described, without determining whether it be really a Propium or
      not. It may perhaps be truly predicated of the subject, and may
      even admit of a better description which would show it to be a
      proprium of the subject; but the description actually set out is
      defective, and the assailant is entitled to impeach it on that
      ground. He now proceeds to a larger discussion: What are the
      conditions for determining whether the supposed Proprium be really
      a Proprium at all, in respect to the subject of which it is
      predicated? Assuming that the description of it is not open to
      impeachment on any of the grounds above enumerated, are there not
      other real grounds of objection, disproving its title to the
      character of Proprium?<a name="FnAnchor9_220" href="#Footnote9_220"><span class="sp">220</span></a></p>

      <p> The distinction here noted by Aristotle (between the two
        questions:— (1) Whether the alleged Proprium is well set out or
        clearly described? (2) Whether the alleged Proprium is a
        Proprium at all?) is not carried out, nor indeed capable of
        being carried out, with strict precision. The two heads of
        questions run together and become confounded. Alexander remarks
        (Scholia, p. 284, b. 24-46, Br.) that the three or four
        last-mentioned <i>loci</i> under the first head embrace the
        second head also. He allows only three <i>loci</i> as belonging
        peculiarly to the first head — &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#948;&#972;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056;
        &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957;:— (1) Equivocal terms; (2) Predicate not reciprocating or
        co-extensive with subject; (3) Predicate not more knowable than
        subject. The other <i>loci</i> (besides these three) enumerated
        by Aristotle under the first head, Alexander considers as
        belonging equally to the second head. But he commends Aristotle
        for making a distinction between the two heads: &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#964;&#8056;
        &#7936;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8048;&#962; &#7972; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

        Barthélemy St. Hilaire explains this nice distinction is not
        clear to me (Note to his translation of Topica, p. 177).</p>

    <p> 1. Suppose your respondent to set up A as a proprium of B: you
      will examine first whether A can be truly predicated of B at all;
      next, if it can so be, whether it is truly predicable of B <i>quâ</i>
      B, or of every thing that comes under B <i>quâ</i> B. Thus, if he
      contends that not to be deceived by reason is a proprium of
      scientific men, you will be able to show that this does not hold
      in geometry, since geometricians are deceived by pseudographemes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>or
      scientific paralogisms. Or, should the respondent deny that A is a
      proprium of B, you will succeed in refuting him, if you can prove
      that A is truly predicable of every B and <i>quâ</i> B. Thus, it
      is a proprium of man to be an animal capable of acquiring
      knowledge; because that attribute is truly predicable of every man
      <i>quâ</i> man.<a name="FnAnchor9_221" href="#Footnote9_221"><span class="sp">221</span></a></p>

    <p> 2. Again, suppose your respondent affirms a given proprium A of
      B: you will examine whether A can be truly predicated of every
      thing called B, and whether B can be truly predicated of every
      thing called A; if not, the alleged proprium will not hold. Thus
      the affirmation, A god is an animal participant of knowledge, is a
      true affirmation; but it would not be true to say, A god is a man:
      wherefore, to be participant of knowledge is not proprium of man;
      and, if this be the proprium which the respondent undertakes to
      maintain, you will be able to refute him. On the other hand, if
      what he undertakes is the negation of a proprium (A is not a
      proprium of B), you will establish the affirmative against him by
      showing that of every thing respecting which A can be truly
      affirmed B can be affirmed also, and <i>vice versâ</i>. You will
      thus show that A is a true proprium of B.<a name="FnAnchor9_222" href="#Footnote9_222"><span class="sp">222</span></a></p>

    <p> 3. Again, the respondent may perhaps affirm the subject itself
      as a proprium of something inherent in the subject. You may refute
      this by showing that, if it were so, the same thing would be a
      proprium of several things differing from each other in species.
      On the other hand, the respondent may perhaps deny that something
      inherent in the subject is a proprium: you may then refute him by
      showing that it is truly predicable of the subject only, and not
      truly predicable of any thing else.<a name="FnAnchor9_223" href="#Footnote9_223"><span class="sp">223</span></a></p>

        Ibid. b. 19-34. Alexander, in the Scholia (p. 285, a. 14, Br.)

    </div>
    <p> 4. The respondent may perhaps affirm as a proprium something
      contained in the essence of the subject: if so, you will refute
      him by showing this. On the other hand, if he denies something to
      be a proprium, you will refute him by showing that, though it is
      not contained in the essence of the subject, it is nevertheless
      predicable co-extensively therewith.<a name="FnAnchor9_224" href="#Footnote9_224"><span class="sp">224</span></a></p>

      necessary concomitant of the subject, but may either precede or
      follow it. Or, on the other hand, he may deny something to be a
      proprium which you can show to be a constant and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>necessary

      concomitant of the subject, without being included either in its
      definition or differentia. In each case you will have a ground for
      refuting him.<a name="FnAnchor9_225" href="#Footnote9_225"><span class="sp">225</span></a></p>

    <p> 6. The respondent may affirm as a proprium of the subject what
      he has already denied of the same subject under some other name;
      or he may deny of it what he has already affirmed of it under some
      other name. You will have grounds for refuting him.<a name="FnAnchor9_226" href="#Footnote9_226"><span class="sp">226</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 7. If there be two subjects (<i>e.g.</i>, man and horse) the
      same with each other in species, the respondent may affirm
      respecting one of them a proprium which is not the same in species
      with the proprium of the other. Thus, it is not a constant
      proprium of horse to stand still spontaneously; accordingly
      neither is it a constant proprium of man to move spontaneously;
      these two propria being the same in species, and belonging both to
      man and to horse <i>quatenus</i> animal.<a name="FnAnchor9_227" href="#Footnote9_227"><span class="sp">227</span></a> If,
      therefore, the respondent affirms the one while he denies the
      other, you have an argument in refutation. On the other hand, he
      may propound as thesis the denial of the one proprium, while he
      affirms or admits the other. Here too you will be able to make
      good the counter-affirmation against his denial, on the ground of
      that which he admits. Thus, if it be proprium of man to be a
      walking-biped, it must also be proprium of bird to be a
      flying-biped. The two pairs, man and bird, walking and flying, are
      the same in species with each other, since both pairs are
      subordinates under the same genus: man and bird are species,
      flying and walking are differentiæ, under the same genus animal.
      This <i>locus</i>, however, is not universally applicable; for
      perhaps one of the two predicates may not be of exclusive
      application to the subject, but may belong to other subjects also.
      Thus walking-biped designates only one variety — man; but
      walking-quadruped designates several — horse, ass, dog, &amp;c.
      Walking-quadruped therefore is not a proprium of horse.<a name="FnAnchor9_228" href="#Footnote9_228"><span class="sp">228</span></a></p>

        &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#942;&#962; (Schol. p. 285, a. 40-45, Br.). It is strange to read
        that man and horse, man and bird, are &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#949;&#953;, the same in

    <p> 8. There is some difficulty in discussing the proprium, when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>the
      respondent is assailed by a sophistical dialectician who avails
      himself of the equivocal application of <i>Idem</i> and <i>Diversum</i>:
      contending that Subject with an Accident becomes a different
      subject — <i>e.g.</i>, <i>homo albus</i>, a subject different
      from <i>homo</i> (so that, when a proprium has been shown to
      belong to <i>homo</i>, it has not been shown that the same
      proprium belongs to <i>homo albus</i>); and that the Abstract is
      a different subject from the Concrete — <i>e.g.</i> cognition,
      from the cognizing man (so that what has been shown as proprium of
      cognition has not been shown as proprium of the cognizing man). If
      the respondent shall himself set up these negatives, leaving to
      you the task of establishing the proprium against him, you will
      meet him by saying that <i>homo</i> is not a subject absolutely
      different and distinct from <i>homo albus</i>, but that there is
      only a notional distinction, the same subject having here two
      names each with a distinct connotation: <i>homo</i> has its own
      connotation; <i>homo albus</i> has also its own connotation,
      embodying in one total that which each of the terms connotes. And,
      when the Sophist remarks that what is a proprium of <i>scientia</i>
      cannot be predicated also as a proprium of <i>homo sciens</i>,
      you will reply that it may be so predicated, only with a slight
      change of inflection. For you need not scruple to employ
      sophistical refutation against those who debate with you in a
      sophistical way.<a name="FnAnchor9_229" href="#Footnote9_229"><span class="sp">229</span></a></p>

        Topic. V. iv. p. 133, b. 15-p. 134, a. 4. &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962;
        &#7952;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;. It appears to me that
        Aristotle is not entitled to treat this objection as sophistical
        (<i>i.e.</i> as unfair Dialectic). He is here considering
        predication as Proprium, contrasted with predication as
        Accident. What is true as an accident respecting <i>homo albus</i>,
        will also be true as an accident respecting <i>homo</i>: but
        what is true as a proprium respecting <i>homo albus</i>, will
        not be true as a proprium respecting <i>homo</i> — nor <i>vice
          versâ</i>. This is a good <i>locus</i> for objections in
        predication of Proprium. There is a real distinction between <i>homo</i>
        and <i>homo albus</i>; between Koriskus and Koriskus <i>albus</i>:
        and one of the ways of elucidating that distinction is by
        pointing out that the proprium of one is not the same as the
        proprium of the other. Aristotle treats those who dwelt upon
        this distinction as Sophists: what their manner of noticing it
        may have been he does not clearly tell us; but if we are to have
        that logical accuracy of speech which <i>his</i> classification
        and theory demand, this distinction must undoubtedly be brought
        to view among the rest.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 9. The respondent may perhaps intend to affirm as proprium
      something which by nature belongs to the subject; but he may err
      in his mode of stating it, and may predicate it as always
      belonging to the subject. Thus, he may predicate biped as a
      proprium always belonging to man. Under this mode of expression,
      you will be able to show that he is wrong; for there are some men
      who have not two feet. On the other hand, if the respondent denies
      biped to be a proprium of man, relying upon the statement that it
      is not actually true of every individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span> you will be able to
      show against him that it is so in the correct phraseology of
      belonging to man by nature.<a name="FnAnchor9_230" href="#Footnote9_230"><span class="sp">230</span></a></p>

        Topic. V. v. p. 131, a. 5-17. This <i>locus</i> is a question
        rather of phraseology than of real fact, and seems therefore
        rather to belong to the former class of <i>Loci</i> respecting
        the Proprium — &#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#7970; &#959;&#8016; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#941;&#948;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957; —
        than to the present class, which Aristotle declares (V. iv. p.
        132, a. 25) to relate to the question &#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#972;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8005;&#955;&#969;&#962;

    <p> 10. That which is affirmed as a proprium may belong to its
      subject either primarily and immediately, or in a secondary way —
      relatively to some prior denomination of the same subject. In such
      cases it is difficult to set out the proprium in terms thoroughly
      unobjectionable. Thus, the superficies of a body is what is <i>first</i>
      coloured: when we speak of <i>corpus album</i>, this is by reason
      of its white superficies. <i>Album</i> is a proprium true both of
      body and of superficies; but the explanation usually given of
      Proprium will not hold here — that, wherever the predicate can be
      affirmed, the subject can be affirmed also. <i>Album</i> is
      proprium of superficies; and <i>album</i> can be truly affirmed
      as also proprium of body; but superficies cannot be truly affirmed
      of body.<a name="FnAnchor9_231" href="#Footnote9_231"><span class="sp">231</span></a></p>

    <p> 11. The respondent who is affirming a Proprium may sometimes err
      by not clearly distinguishing in what mode, and in respect to what
      precise subject, he intends to affirm it. There are ten different
      modes, in one or other of which he always proposes to affirm it:—<a name="FnAnchor9_232" href="#Footnote9_232"><span class="sp">232</span></a>
    </p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>a.</i> As belonging to the subject by nature. <i>E.g.</i>,
      Biped is by nature a proprium of man.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>b.</i> As belonging to the subject simply — in
      some way or other. <i>E.g.</i>, To have four fingers, belongs to
      Koriskus or some other individual man.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>c.</i> As belonging to the <i>species</i>. <i>E.g.</i>,
      It belongs to fire to be the most subtle of all bodies.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>d.</i> As belonging absolutely (&#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#960;&#949;&#961;
      &#950;&#8180;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#8056; &#950;&#8134;&#957;) — in virtue of the essence of the subject — <i>per
        se</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_233" href="#Footnote9_233"><span class="sp">233</span></a></p>
    <p class="ref"> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span><i>e.</i> As belonging to the
      subject by reason of some primary intervening aspect or attribute
      thereof. <i>E.g.</i>, Prudence is a proprium of the soul, looked
      at <i>quatenus</i> reasonable or intellectual.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>f.</i> As belonging to that primary attribute or
      special aspect, logically distinguished and named separately from
      the subject. <i>E.g.</i>, Prudence is a proprium of the <i>logistikon</i>
      or <i>rationale</i>. </p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>g.</i> As belonging to the subject viewed as
      possessing or holding in possession. <i>E.g.</i>, The scientific
      man possesses that acquired mental habit which renders him
      incapable of having his convictions farther altered by discussion.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>h.</i> As belonging to some possession held by a
      possessing person. <i>E.g.</i>, Science is unalterable by
      discussion; where science, a possession of the scientific man, is
      assigned as subject of the proprium, unalterable by discussion.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>i.</i> As belonging to a subject which is
      partaken or held in participation by another subject lying behind.
      <i>E.g.</i>, Sensible perception is a proprium of the genus animal
      which genus is partaken or held in participation by this
      individual man, that individual horse, &amp;c.; whence it may be
      predicated not only of animal but also of man, as thus
      participant.</p>
    <p class="ref"> <i>k.</i> As belonging to the ultimate subject
      partaking. <i>E.g.</i>, To live is a proprium of this particular
      man or horse, participant in the genus animal, in the way just
      indicated. </p>

      should it be a superlative) and not to others: perhaps it may <span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
      belong to some conspicuously, and to others faintly. Or perhaps,
      if he does add the express words — <i>to the species</i>, he may

    <p class="ref"> <i>e.</i> <i>f.</i> Not to distinguish whether he
      means to affirm it of B by reason of A, or of A directly: he will
      lay himself open to the objection that his proprium, and the

      &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;: you may then refute him by showing that &#960;&#961;&#941;&#960;&#959;&#957; is

      be a proprium of B on the ground that A is identical with B, you
      will make out the affirmative against him by showing that A is not
      identical with B, but only co-extensive and reciprocating
      therewith. Thus, you may show that animated substance is not

      part separately what cannot be truly declared as proprium of the

      there are various cases in which what is true of each homœomeric
      part is not true of the whole; and <i>vice versâ</i>. If your

    <p> 14. Respecting <i>Opposita</i>, there are different <i>loci</i>
      for different varieties. </p>
    <p> <i>a.</i> <i>Contraria</i>. — Suppose the respondent to affirm
      A as proprium of B: you will examine whether the contrary of A is
      proprium of the contrary of B. If it be not, then neither is A
      proprium of B. Thus, if best is not a proprium of justice, neither
      can worst be a proprium of injustice. If the respondent is on the
      negative side, you may prove the affirmative against him by
      showing that the contrary of the alleged proprium is a proprium of
      the contrary of the alleged subject.<a name="FnAnchor9_238" href="#Footnote9_238"><span class="sp">238</span></a></p>

    <p> <i>b.</i> <i>Relata</i>. — Suppose the respondent to affirm a
      <i>relatum</i> A as proprium of a <i>relatum</i> B, you may
      refute him by showing that the correlate of A is not proprium of
      the correlate of B. Suppose him to deny the same, you will refute
      him by proving the affirmative between correlate and correlate.<a name="FnAnchor9_239" href="#Footnote9_239"><span class="sp">239</span></a></p>

      to affirm an attribute of the <i>habitus</i> B, as proprium
      thereof: you may refute him by showing that the corresponding
      attribute of the <i>privatio</i> correlating with <i>habitus</i>
      B, is not proprium of that <i>privatio</i>. Suppose him to take
      the negative side, you will refute him by proving the affirmative
      of this latter proposition.<a name="FnAnchor9_240" href="#Footnote9_240"><span class="sp">240</span></a></p>

      negation of the same), more than one mode of dealing may be
      stated. Wherever the affirmation is a proprium of the subject, the
      negation cannot also be a proprium thereof; and <i>vice versâ</i>.
      If the affirmative predicate be not a proprium of the affirmative
      subject, neither can the negative predicate be proprium of the
      negative subject; and <i>vice versâ</i>. If the affirmative
      predicate be proprium of the affirmative subject, the negative
      predicate will also be proprium of the negative subject. The same
      predicate cannot be proprium both of the affirmative subject and
      of the negative subject.<a name="FnAnchor9_241" href="#Footnote9_241"><span class="sp">241</span></a></p>

    <p> 16. Respecting two or more Contra-Specific Terms under the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>same

      genus and exhausting the whole genus:— Suppose A and B
      contra-specific terms used as subjects; C and D contra-specific
      terms used as predicates. If C be not a proprium of A, neither
      will D be a proprium of B; thus, if perceivable (&#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;) is not
      a proprium of any other species (except gods) included under the
      genus animal, neither will intelligible (&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;) be proprium of a
      god. Again, if C be a proprium of A, D also will be a proprium of
      B. Thus, if it be a proprium of prudence to be by its own nature
      the excellence of the rational or calculating soul (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;),
      we must also affirm as proprium of temperance that it is the
      excellence of the appetitive soul (&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;).<a name="FnAnchor9_242" href="#Footnote9_242"><span class="sp">242</span></a></p>

        termes, qui sont deux à deux les membres d’une division: si le
        premier n’est pas le propre du troisième, le second ne le sera
        pas du quatrième; et réciproquement pour la négation d’abord.
        Les quatre termes sont ici: sensible, intelligible, membres
        d’une même division: mortel, divinité, membres d’une autre
        division.” (Barthélemy St. Hilaire, p. 197.)</p>
    </div>
    <p> 17. Respecting Cases or Inflections, either of the subject B, or
      the predicate A:— If the case or inflection of the predicate be
      not a proprium of the corresponding case or inflection of the
      subject, neither will the predicate be proprium of the subject. If
      the case or inflection of the predicate be a proprium of the
      corresponding case or inflection of the subject, then the
      predicate itself will also be proprium of the subject. <i>Pulchré</i>
      is not proprium of <i>justé</i>; therefore, <i>pulchrum</i> is
      not proprium of <i>justum</i>.</p>
    <p> This <i>locus</i> will be found available in combination with
      the preceding <i>locus</i> bearing on <i>Opposita</i>. Not only
      <i>opposita</i> themselves, but also the cases and inflections of
      <i>opposita</i>, may be adduced as arguments, following the rules
      above laid down.<a name="FnAnchor9_243" href="#Footnote9_243"><span class="sp">243</span></a></p>

    <p> 18. Analogous cases or propositions:— If the respondent affirms
      A as proprium of B, you have an argument against him by showing
      that something analogous to A is not proprium of a subject
      analogous to B. Thus, the builder, in relation to house-making, is
      analogous to the physician, in relation to health-making; now
      health-making is not the proprium of the physician, and therefore
      neither is house-making the proprium of the builder. If the
      respondent has advanced a negative, you will apply this same <i>locus</i>
      in the affirmative against him: <i>e.g.</i>, as it is the
      proprium of the gymnast to impart a good habit of body, so it is
      the proprium of the physician to impart health.<a name="FnAnchor9_244" href="#Footnote9_244"><span class="sp">244</span></a></p>

    <p> 19. <i>Esse</i>, and <i>Generari</i> or <i>Fieri</i>:— If A
      considered as <i>Ens</i> is not the proprium of B considered as <i>Ens</i>,
      then neither will A considered as <i>Fiens</i> be the proprium of
      B considered as <i>Fiens</i>. <i>Vice <span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>versâ</i>, on the
      affirmative side: if the former of these two be the fact, you may
      argue that the latter is the fact also.<a name="FnAnchor9_245" href="#Footnote9_245"><span class="sp">245</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 20. Comparison with the Idea:— If the respondent sets up A as
      proprium of B, you will turn your mind to the Idea of B, and note
      whether A is proprium of this Idea, in the same sense and under
      the same aspect as it is affirmed to be proprium of B. If it be
      not so, you will have an argument in refutation of the respondent.
      Thus, if he maintains that it is a proprium of man to be at rest,
      you will argue that this cannot be so, because to be at rest is
      not the proprium of the Self-man (&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;) <i>quatenus</i>
      man, but <i>quatenus</i> Idea. <i>Vice versâ</i>, you will have
      an affirmative argument, if you can show that it is the proprium
      of the Idea. Thus, since it is a proprium of the self-animal <i>quatenus</i>
      animal to be composed of soul and body, you may infer that to be
      composed of soul and body is really a proprium of animal.<a name="FnAnchor9_246" href="#Footnote9_246"><span class="sp">246</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 21. <i>Locus</i> from More and Less:— Suppose the respondent to
      affirm A as proprium of B: you will have an argument against him,
      if you can show that what is more A is not proprium of that which
      is more B. Thus, if to be more coloured is not proprium of that
      which is more body, neither is to be less coloured proprium of
      that which is less body; nor is to be coloured proprium of body
      simply. <i>Vice versâ</i>, if you can show that what is more A is
      proprium of what is more B, you will have an affirmative argument
      to establish that A is proprium of B. Thus, to perceive more is
      proprium of that which is more living. Hence, to perceive simply
      is proprium of that which is living simply; also, to perceive
      most, least, or less, is proprium of that which is most, least, or
      less living, respectively.<a name="FnAnchor9_247" href="#Footnote9_247"><span class="sp">247</span></a></p>
    <p> </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote9_247" id="Footnote9_247"></a><a href="#FnAnchor9_247">247</a></span>
        Ibid. viii. p. 137, b. 14-27.</p>
    </div>
    <p> If you can show that A simply is not proprium of B simply, you
      have an argument to establish that what is more or less A is not
      proprium of that which is more or less B. If, on the other land,
      you show the affirmative of the first, this will be an argument
      sustaining the affirmative of the last.<a name="FnAnchor9_248" href="#Footnote9_248"><span class="sp">248</span></a> Perhaps
      you can show that what is more A is not proprium of what is more
      B: this will be an argument to show that A is not proprium of B.
      Thus, to perceive is more proprium of animal than to know is
      proprium of man; but to perceive is not proprium of animal;
      therefore, to know is not proprium of man. Or again, if you can
      show that what is less A is proprium of what is less B, this will
      form an argument to show that A is proprium of B. Thus, natural
      mansuetude is less proprium of man than life is proprium<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span> of
      animal; but natural mansuetude <i>is</i> proprium of man:
      therefore life is proprium of animal.<a name="FnAnchor9_249" href="#Footnote9_249"><span class="sp">249</span></a> Farther,
      if you can show that A is more a proprium of C than it is a
      proprium of B, yet nevertheless that it is not a proprium of C you
      may thence argue that A is not a proprium of B. Thus, to be
      coloured is more a proprium of superficies than it is a proprium
      of body; yet it is not a proprium of superficies; therefore, it is
      <i>not</i> a proprium of body. This last variety of the <i>locus</i>
      of More and Less (Aristotle remarks) affords no corresponding
      affirmative plea;<a name="FnAnchor9_250" href="#Footnote9_250"><span class="sp">250</span></a> for the same predicate cannot be a
      proprium of many subjects. If A be really a proprium of
      superficies, it cannot be also proprium of body. Lastly, you may
      perhaps be able to show that C is more a proprium of B than A is a
      proprium of B; yet, if C is <i>not</i> a proprium of B, you will
      infer negatively that neither is A proprium of B. Thus, to be
      perceivable is more proprium of animal, than to be divisible is
      proprium of animal; yet to be perceivable is <i>not</i> proprium
      of animal, and, therefore, neither is to be divisible proprium of
      animal. You may invert this argument for the affirmative, if you
      can show that C is less a proprium of B than A is a proprium of B,
      yet still that C <i>is</i> a proprium of B; hence you will infer,
      <i>à fortiori</i>, that A is a proprium thereof. <i>E.g.</i>, If
      to perceive is less a proprium of animal than to live is a
      proprium thereof, yet to perceive <i>is</i> a proprium of animal;
      then, to live is so likewise.<a name="FnAnchor9_251" href="#Footnote9_251"><span class="sp">251</span></a></p>

    <p> 22. <i>Locus</i> from Equal Relation:— Arguments both negative
      and affirmative may in like manner be obtained by comparing
      different things which are (not more or less propria, but) alike
      or equally propria of some other subject. If A is as much a
      proprium of B as C is proprium of D, while yet A is <i>not</i> a
      proprium of B, you may hence infer that C is not a proprium of D.
      If, under this hypothesis, A <i>is</i> a proprium of B, you may
      infer affirmatively that C is a proprium of D.<a name="FnAnchor9_252" href="#Footnote9_252"><span class="sp">252</span></a>
      Or, if A and C be, alike and equally, propria of the same subject
      B, then, if you show that A is not proprium thereof, you will
      infer negatively that C is not so; if you show that A <i>is</i>
      proprium of B, you will infer affirmatively that C is so likewise.
      Or, thirdly, if A be, alike and equally, a proprium of B and of E,
      then, if you can show that A is <i>not</i> a proprium of E, you
      may infer negatively that it is <i>not</i> a proprium of B. Here,
      however, the counter-inference affirmatively is not allowable; for
      the same proprium cannot belong as proprium to two distinct
      subjects, as was stated before.<a name="FnAnchor9_253" href="#Footnote9_253"><span class="sp">253</span></a></p>

      <i>Locus</i> from Potentiality:— No potentiality whatever can
      belong to <i>Non-Ens</i>. Accordingly, if A, the proprium
      affirmed of a subject B, is a potentiality, this must imply some
      real <i>Ens</i> in which it inheres, and which is correlate to
      the subject. But, if in the specification of the proprium no
      allusion is made to such correlate, you will attack it as a bad
      proprium — as a potentiality inhering in <i>Non-Ens</i> or
      nothing. <i>E.g.</i>, if the case be, It is a proprium of air to
      be respirable, you will refute this by pointing out that this is
      true only when there exist animals in whom the potentiality of
      breathing resides; that no mention is made by the respondent of
      this correlate or of any other correlate; in other words, that, so
      far as the specification is concerned, the correlate is passed
      over as <i>Non-Ens</i> or a non-entity. Therefore the proprium is
      not a good proprium.<a name="FnAnchor9_254" href="#Footnote9_254"><span class="sp">254</span></a> Again, suppose the affirmation to
      be, It is a proprium of <i>Ens</i> to be capable of doing or
      suffering something; this will be defensible because it is only
      when the subject <i>is Ens</i>, that it is declared to have such
      proprium.<a name="FnAnchor9_255" href="#Footnote9_255"><span class="sp">255</span></a></p>

      <p> <i>Respirability</i> (the proprium here discussed) being a
        relative term, Aristotle demands that the correlate thereof
        shall be named and included in setting out the proprium. If this
        be not done, a refutative argument may be drawn from such
        omission — that the respondent was not aware of the relativity.
        We may remark here that this objection is founded on a bad or
        incomplete specification of the proprium in question: it is not
        an objection against the reality of that proprium itself, if
        carefully described. The objection belongs to that class which
        Aristotle had discussed before, at the commencement of Book V.</p>

    <h2>VI.</h2>
    <p> We now enter on the Sixth Book, containing the <i>Loci</i>
      bearing on Definition. In debates respecting Definition, there are
      five points on any of which the attack and defence may turn:—<a name="FnAnchor9_257" href="#Footnote9_257"><span class="sp">257</span></a></p>
    <p class="ref"> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>1. That which the definer
      enunciates as a definition may not be true at all, even as a
      predicate of the definiend or subject to be defined; or at least
      not true of everything that bears the name of the subject. </p>
    <p class="ref"> 2. The definiend may have been included in a genus,
      but not in that genus to which it rightly and specially belongs. </p>
    <p class="ref"> 3. The definition given may not be specially
      appropriate to the definiend (<i>i.e.</i>, it may include, not
      only that but, other matters besides).</p>
    <p class="ref"> 4. The definition, though unobjectionable on any of
      the above three grounds, may nevertheless not declare the Essence
      of the definiend. </p>
    <p class="ref"> 5. Lastly, the definition may be good in substance,
      but badly expressed or set out. </p>

    </div>
    <p> As to the first of these five heads, the <i>Loci</i> bearing
      thereupon have already been enumerated in the Third Book, on
      Accident: in accidental predications the question raised is always
      about the truth or falsehood of the predication.<a name="FnAnchor9_258" href="#Footnote9_258"><span class="sp">258</span></a>
      As to the second and third of the five heads, these have been
      dealt with in the Fourth and Fifth Books, enumerating the <i>Loci</i>
      on Genus and Proprium.<a name="FnAnchor9_259" href="#Footnote9_259"><span class="sp">259</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> There remain the fourth and fifth heads, on which we are about
      to enter: (1) Whether the definition is well expressed or set out
      (the fifth head); (2) Whether it has any right to be called a
      definition at all, <i>i.e.</i>, whether it declares the Essence
      of the subject (the fourth).<a name="FnAnchor9_260" href="#Footnote9_260"><span class="sp">260</span></a> The fifth
      is taken first, because to do a thing well is always more
      difficult than to do it simply, and is therefore likely to afford
      greater opening for argumentative attack. </p>

    </div>
    <p> The definition, while unobjectionable in substance, may be badly
      set out in two ways. First, it may be indistinct in terms — not
      plain nor clear. Next, it may be redundant: the terms may include
      more than is required for the definition. Under each of these
      defects of expression several <i>loci</i> may be indicated.<a name="FnAnchor9_261" href="#Footnote9_261"><span class="sp">261</span></a></p>

    <p> 1. Indistinctness may arise from the employment of equivocal
      terms in the definition. Or it may arise from the term to be
      defined being itself equivocal; while the definer, taking no
      notice of such equivocation, has tried to comprehend all its
      senses under one and the same definition. You may attack him
      either by denying that the definition as given covers all the
      different meanings of the definiend; or you may yourself
      distinguish (which the definer has omitted to do) these different
      meanings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
      and show that none of them or few of them are covered by the
      definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_262" href="#Footnote9_262"><span class="sp">262</span></a></p>

        &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#941;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;.</p>
      <p> The term &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957; surprises us here, because the point
        under consideration is indicated by Aristotle himself as a real
        mistake; accordingly he ought not to characterize the procedure
        whereby such mistake is exposed as <i>mere cavil</i> —
        &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;. Alexander, in the Scholia (p. 287, b. 1, Br.), says
        that Aristotle intends to apply the term &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957; to the
        respondent who advances this bad definition, not to the
        assailant who impeaches it. But the text of Aristotle does not
        harmonize with this interpretation.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 2. Indistinctness may arise from defining by means of a
      metaphor; but Aristotle treats you as a caviller if you impugn
      this metaphor as though it were <i>proprio sensu</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_263" href="#Footnote9_263"><span class="sp">263</span></a>
      He declares it to be wrong, but he seems to think that you ought
      to object to it at once as a metaphor, without troubling yourself
      to prove it inappropriate.</p>

Here again
        we have the word &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957; to designate what seems a
        legitimate mode of argumentative attack.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 3. Indistinctness will arise if the terms of the definition are
      rare or far-fetched or founded upon some fact very little known.<a name="FnAnchor9_264" href="#Footnote9_264"><span class="sp">264</span></a>
      Definitions given by Plato are cited to illustrate this.</p>

    </div>
    <p> 4. Indistinctness arises from the employment of a poetical
      image, which is even worse than a professed metaphor: as where law
      is defined to be — a measure or image of things by nature just.<a name="FnAnchor9_265" href="#Footnote9_265"><span class="sp">265</span></a></p>
    <p> </p>

    </div>
    <p> 5. The definition is indistinct, if it does not, while making
      known the definiend, make clear at the same time its contrary.<a name="FnAnchor9_266" href="#Footnote9_266"><span class="sp">266</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 18.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 6. The definition is also indistinct if it does not, when
      enunciated, make known what the definiend is, without requiring
      that the definiend itself shall be expressly enunciated. The
      definition by itself ought to suggest at once the name of the
      definiend. Otherwise, the definer is no better than those archaic
      painters, who, when painting a dog or a horse, were compelled to
      write the name alongside in order that the animal might be
      recognized.<a name="FnAnchor9_267" href="#Footnote9_267"><span class="sp">267</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 20. This last condition is a high measure of perfection
        to exact from a definition. Assuredly Aristotle’s own
        definitions often fall lamentably short of it.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Such are the <i>Loci</i> regarding Indistinctness in the
      setting out of the definition. The second defect is Redundancy.</p>
    <p> 1. Redundancy will arise if the terms of the definition include
      either all things absolutely, or all things contained in the same
      genus as the definiend; since the definition ought to consist of a
      generic term to discriminate the definiend from all <span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>extra-generic

      things, and a differential term to discriminate it from other
      things within the same genus. A definition of the kind mentioned
      will be useless through redundancy.<a name="FnAnchor9_268" href="#Footnote9_268"><span class="sp">268</span></a> It will
      also be open to the like objection, if it includes what is merely
      a proprium of the definiend, over and above the essential
      attributes; or, indeed, if it includes any thing else except what
      is required for clearly bringing out the definiend.<a name="FnAnchor9_269" href="#Footnote9_269"><span class="sp">269</span></a>
      It will be still worse, if it comprises any attribute not
      belonging to all individuals of the species; for then it will not
      even be a proprium or a reciprocating predication.<a name="FnAnchor9_270" href="#Footnote9_270"><span class="sp">270</span></a></p>

        Topic. VI. iii. p. 140, a. 23-32. Alexander, however, remarks
        very pertinently, that the defects of such a definition are

    <p> So much for the faults which belong to the manner of expressing
      the definition tendered. Next, as bearing on the matter and
      substance of the definition, the following <i>loci</i> are
      distinguishable. </p>
    <p> 1. The first of these <i>loci</i> is, if the matter of the
      definition is not <i>prius</i> and <i>notius</i> as compared
      with the definiend. It is one of the canons of Definition, the
      purpose of which is to impart knowledge of the definiend, to
      introduce nothing except what is prior by nature and better known
      than the latter. The essence of each definiend — the being what it
      is — is one and only one. If a definition be given, other than
      that by means of what is <i>prius</i> and <i>notius</i>, it
      would follow that the same definiend might have two distinct
      essences; which is impossible. Accordingly, any proposition
      tendered as a definition but enunciating what is not prior by
      nature and better known than the definiend sins against this
      canon, and is to be held as no true definition at all.<a name="FnAnchor9_272" href="#Footnote9_272"><span class="sp">272</span></a></p>

        Ibid. iv. p. 141, a. 24-b. 2.</p>
    </div>
    <p> The <i>locus</i> here indicated by this general feature is one,
      but it includes a number of varieties.<a name="FnAnchor9_273" href="#Footnote9_273"><span class="sp">273</span></a> More
      known, or less known, it should first be observed, has two
      distinct meanings: either more or less known <i>absolutely</i> (<i>by

        nature</i>); or more or less known <i>to us</i>. Absolutely, or
      by nature, the point is better known than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>the line; the line,
      than the superficies; the superficies, than the solid; the <i>prius</i>,
      than the <i>posterius</i>. But <i>to us</i> the reverse is true.
      The solid, as object of sensible perception, is earlier known and
      more known than the superficies; the superficies, than the line;
      the line, than the point; the <i>posterius</i>, than the <i>prius</i>.
      <i>To us</i> means to the bulk of mankind: <i>absolutely</i> or <i>by

        nature</i> refers to the instructed, superior, teaching and
      expository, intellects.<a name="FnAnchor9_274" href="#Footnote9_274"><span class="sp">274</span></a> There may
      be some cases in which the <i>notius nobis</i> coincides and is
      identical with the <i>notius naturâ</i>;<a name="FnAnchor9_275" href="#Footnote9_275"><span class="sp">275</span></a> but, as a
      rule, the two are distinct, and the one is the inverse of the
      other. A genuine and perfect definition is one which enunciates
      the essence of the Species through Genus and Differentiæ, which
      are both of them absolutely prior and more knowable than the
      Species, since, if they be supposed non-existent, the Species is
      nowhere to be found. No man can know the Species without knowing
      its Genus and Differentiæ; but you may know the Genus and
      Differentiæ without knowing the Species; hence the Species is more
      unknowable than they are.<a name="FnAnchor9_276" href="#Footnote9_276"><span class="sp">276</span></a> This is
      the true scientific definition; but there are persons incapable of
      acquiring knowledge by means of it. To these persons, an imperfect
      explanation or quasi-definition must be given, by means of matters
      knowable to them.<a name="FnAnchor9_277" href="#Footnote9_277"><span class="sp">277</span></a> Those, however, who regard such
      imperfect explanations as true definitions, must be reminded that,
      upon that hypothesis, we should be compelled to admit many
      distinct definitions of the same definiend. For individuals differ
      from each other in respect to what is more knowable: what is more
      so to one man is not more so to another. Indeed the same man
      differs from himself on this point at different periods: to the
      early and untrained mind objects of sensible perception are the
      most knowable; but, when a man has been improved by training and
      instruction, the case is reversed, and the objects of intellect
      become the most familiar to his mind.<a name="FnAnchor9_278" href="#Footnote9_278"><span class="sp">278</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>To
      define properly, therefore, we must enunciate, not the <i>notiora
        nobis</i> but, the <i>notiora naturâ</i> or <i>simpliciter</i>;
      understanding by this last phrase, not what is more knowable to
      all actual men but, what is more knowable to men of well-trained
      and well-constituted intellect; just as, when we speak of the
      wholesome, we mean what is wholesome to the well-constituted body.<a name="FnAnchor9_279" href="#Footnote9_279"><span class="sp">279</span></a>
      These conditions of Definition you must thoroughly master, and
      apply to each debate as the occasion may require. Your task in
      refuting an alleged definition will be the easiest in those cases
      where it conforms to neither of the above conditions; that is,
      when it enunciates neither what is <i>notius naturâ</i> nor what
      is <i>notius nobis</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_280" href="#Footnote9_280"><span class="sp">280</span></a></p>

      <p> The general mental fact here noticed by Aristotle may be seen
        philosophically stated and explained in the volume of Professor
        Bain on the Emotions and the Will. (Chapter on Consciousness,
        sect. 19, p. 581, 2nd ed.)</p>
      <p> “A sensation is, under any view of it, a conscious element of
        the mind. As pleasure or pain, we are conscious in one way; as
        discrimination, we are conscious in the other way, namely, in a
        mode of neutral excitement. — But this is not all. After much
        contact with the sensible world, a new situation arises, and a
        new variety of the consciousness, which stands in need of some
        explanation. When a child experiences for the first time the
        sensation of scarlet, there is nothing but the sensibility of a
        new impression more or less intense.… It is very difficult for
        us to realize or define this original shock, our position in
        mature life being totally altered. It is the rarest thing for us
        <i>then</i> to come under a radically new impression; and we can
        only, by help of imperfect analogies, form an approximate
        conception of what happens at the first shock of a
        discriminative sensation. The process of engraining these
        impressions on the mind after repetition, gives to subsequent
        sensations quite a different character as compared with the
        first. The second shock of scarlet, if it stood alone, would
        doubtless resemble the preceding; but such is the nature of the
        mind, that the new shock will not stand alone, but restores the
        notion or idea or trace that survived the former. The sensation
        is no longer the primitive stroke of surprise, but a coalition
        of a present shock with all that remains of the previous
        occasions. Hence it may properly be said, when we see, or hear,
        or touch, or move, that what comes before us is really
        contributed more by the mind itself than by the object present.
        The consciousness is complicated by three concurring elements —
        the new shock, the flash of agreement with the sum total of the
        past, and the feeling of that past as revived in the present. In
        truth, the new sensation is apt to be entirely over-ridden by
        the old; and, in place of discriminating by virtue of our
        susceptibility to what is characteristic in it, our
        discrimination follows another course. For example, if I have
        before me two shades of colour, instead of feeling the
        difference exactly as I am struck at the moment, my judgment
        resorts to the round-about process of first identifying each
        with some reiterated series of past impressions; and, having two
        sum-totals in my mind, the difference that I feel is between
        those totals. If I made a mistake, it may be attributed not so
        much to a wrong act of discrimination, as to a wrong act of
        identification. — All sensations, therefore, after the first of
        each kind, involve a flash of recovery from the past, which is
        what really determines their character. The present shock is
        simply made use of as a means of reviving some one past in
        preference to all others; the new impression of scarlet is in
        itself almost insignificant, serving only as the medium of
        resuscitating the cerebral condition resulting from the united
        force of all the previous scarlets. — Sensation thus calls into
        operation the two great intellectual laws, in addition to the
        primitive sensibility of difference. — When we consider
        ourselves as performing the most ordinary act of seeing or
        hearing, we are bringing into play those very functions of the
        intellect that make its development and its glory in its highest
        manifestations.”</p>

    <p> The canon being, That what is <i>posterius</i> must be defined
      by its <i>prius</i>, — the definer may sin against this in
      defining the <i>prius</i> by its <i>posterius</i>; <i>e.g.</i>,
      if he defines the stationary and the determinate by means of the
      moveable and the variable.<a name="FnAnchor9_281" href="#Footnote9_281"><span class="sp">281</span></a> Also, when
      his definition is neither <i>prius</i>, nor <i>posterius</i>,
      but of equal position with the definiend, he is at fault. This may
      happen (1) when he defines by an Opposite (for, according to some,
      the science of Opposites is one and the same, and it is impossible
      that either one of a pair can be absolutely more knowable than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>the
      other; though it is true that no relative can be understood or
      explained without the knowledge of its correlative, <i>e.g.</i>,
      double and half); or (2) when he includes the definiend itself in
      his definition, either under its proper name or any other name;<a name="FnAnchor9_282" href="#Footnote9_282"><span class="sp">282</span></a>
      or (3) when he defines by means of a contra-specific to the
      definiend — by something of equal specific rank or position, which
      is therefore <i>simul naturâ</i> therewith (<i>e.g.</i>, Odd is
      that which is greater than even by unity); or (4) when he defines
      by something specifically subordinate (<i>e.g.</i>, An even number
      is that which may be bisected, where bisected means divisible by
      two, itself one among the even numbers<a name="FnAnchor9_283" href="#Footnote9_283"><span class="sp">283</span></a>).</p>

        et Notius</i>) of argument for <span class="correction" title="amended from 'impunging'">impugning</span> a definition
      is, where it does not enunciate the genus in which the definiend
      is really included. The mention of the genus, as enunciating the
      fundamental essence of the definiend, ought to stand first in the
      definition. If your opponent defines body — that which has three
      dimensions, or man — that which knows how to count, you attack him
      by asking, What is it that has three dimensions? What is it that
      knows how to count? No genus has been assigned.<a name="FnAnchor9_284" href="#Footnote9_284"><span class="sp">284</span></a></p>

    <p> 3. A third <i>locus</i> is, where the definiend is a complex
      whole having reference to several distinct facts or phenomena,
      while the definition indicates only one of them. Thus, if grammar
      be defined — the knowing how to write from dictation, you will
      object that it is just as much — the knowing how to read. The
      definition is incomplete unless it includes both.<a name="FnAnchor9_285" href="#Footnote9_285"><span class="sp">285</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 4. A fourth <i>locus</i> is, where the definiend admits both of
      a better and a worse construction, and where the definition
      enunciates only the worse. You may impugn it, on the ground that
      every cognition and every power must be understood as tending to
      its best results.<a name="FnAnchor9_286" href="#Footnote9_286"><span class="sp">286</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 6. A fifth <i>locus</i> is, where the definiend is enunciated
      as ranking, not in the lowest and nearest species to which it
      belongs but, in some higher and more distinct genus. Here the real
      essence will not be declared, and the definition will thus be
      incomplete; unless indeed it includes, along with the highest
      genus, the superadded mention of all the differentiæ descending
      down to the lowest species. It will then be complete, because it
      will include, in circumlocutory phrase, all that would be declared
      by enunciating the specific name.<a name="FnAnchor9_287" href="#Footnote9_287"><span class="sp">287</span></a></p>

      Assuming the genus to be truly declared in the definition you will
      examine whether the differentiæ enunciated are differentiæ at all?
      whether they really belong to the definiend? what is it which they
      serve to contrast with and exclude, — since, if there be nothing
      such, they cannot be truly differentiæ? whether the differential
      term and its counter-differential apply to and cover the whole
      genus? whether, granting the differentia to be real, it be such,
      when taken along with the genus, as to constitute a true species,
      and whether its counter-differentia be such also? This is a <i>locus</i>
      furnishing many possibilities of impugning the definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_288" href="#Footnote9_288"><span class="sp">288</span></a></p>

    <p> 7. Perhaps the definition may enunciate a differentia which is
      merely negative; <i>e.g.</i>, A line is length without breadth.
      If you are debating with a respondent who holds the (Platonic)
      doctrine of Ideas, and who considers each Idea or genus to be
      something numerically one, distinct from all its participants, you
      will find here a <i>locus</i> for attacking them.<a name="FnAnchor9_289" href="#Footnote9_289"><span class="sp">289</span></a>
      He asserts the existence of a Self-long or generical long, a
      Self-animal or generic animal, each numerically one. Now, upon
      this hypothesis, since of all long you may predicate either in the
      affirmative or the negative (<i>i.e.</i>, either it is broad or it
      is not broad), so this alternative may be predicated of the
      Self-long or generical long; and thus the genus will coincide
      with, or fall under the definition of, one among its own species.
      Or, if this be denied, it will follow that the generic long must
      be both broad and not broad; which is a contradiction still more
      inadmissible. Accordingly, against one who holds the doctrine of
      Ideas, declaring the genus to be <i>unum numero</i>, the negative
      differentia will furnish grounds for attack; but not against any
      other respondent.<a name="FnAnchor9_290" href="#Footnote9_290"><span class="sp">290</span></a> For there are various cases in which
      the negative must be employed as a part of the differentia: <i>e.g.</i>,
      in privative terms, blind is one whose nature it is to see but who
      does not see. And, even when the differentia enunciated is
      affirmative, it may have for its condivident member only a
      negative term, <i>e.g.</i>, length having-breadth has for its
      condivident member only the negative, length not-having-breadth.<a name="FnAnchor9_291" href="#Footnote9_291"><span class="sp">291</span></a></p>

      or what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>belongs

      species may be found predicable of the entire genus; or the genus
      may be found predicable of the differentia itself, and not of
      objects under it; or the species (sometimes even one of its
      sub-species) may be found predicable of the differentia; or
      perhaps the differentia may not be a <i>prius</i> as regards the
      species (which it ought to be, while it is a <i>posterius</i> as
      regards the genus). Arguments against the definition may be drawn
      from any one of these loci.<a name="FnAnchor9_293" href="#Footnote9_293"><span class="sp">293</span></a></p>

    <p> 10. Recollect that the same differentia cannot belong to two
      distinct genera neither of which comprehends the other, unless
      both are comprehended under some higher genus. Examine whether
      this is observed in the definition tendered to you.<a name="FnAnchor9_294" href="#Footnote9_294"><span class="sp">294</span></a></p>

    <p> 11. No genuine differentia can be derived either from the
      Category <i>Ubi</i> or from the Category <i>Passio</i>; for
      neither of them furnishes characteristics essential to the
      subject. All <i>Passio</i> when intensified to a certain degree
      destroys the essence of the subject and removes it from its own
      appropriate species; but the differentia is inseparable from its
      subject; accordingly, nothing by virtue of which the subject is
      called &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8150;&#959;&#957; can be a true differentia. If the definition sins
      against this rule, it will be open to question.<a name="FnAnchor9_295" href="#Footnote9_295"><span class="sp">295</span></a></p>

    <p> 12. If the subject be relative, its true differentia ought to be
      relative also; thus, science or cognition is a <i>relatum</i>,
      and accordingly its three differentiæ — theoretical, practical,
      constructive — are all <i>relata</i> also.<a name="FnAnchor9_296" href="#Footnote9_296"><span class="sp">296</span></a> The
      definition must conform to this; and it must also, in cases where
      the relative subject has more than one correlate, declare that
      correlate which is the ordinary and natural one, not any other
      which is rare and realized only on occasion.<a name="FnAnchor9_297" href="#Footnote9_297"><span class="sp">297</span></a>
      You must watch to see whether this condition is observed; and also
      whether the correlative enunciated in the definition is the one
      strictly proximate. Thus, if the definition given of prudence be,
      It is an excellence of man or an excellence of the soul, this will
      not be a good definition. It ought to be — an excellence of the
      rational department of the soul; for it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>through and by
      reason of this department that both man and soul are denominated

    <p> 13. When the definiend is given as an affection or lasting
      condition of some subject, you must examine whether it really
      resides or can reside (as by nature it ought to do) in the subject
      to which it is referred in the definition. If it cannot, the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'defininition'">definition</span>
      is untenable; and this mistake is sometimes made, the producing
      conditions of a phenomenon being confounded with the phenomenon
      itself, or <i>vice versâ</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_299" href="#Footnote9_299"><span class="sp">299</span></a> Thus, some
      persons have defined sleep — incapacity of sensible perception;
      doubt — equality of contrary reasonings; pain — breach of

      grow together. Now sleep does not reside in perception, nor doubt
      in reasonings. Sleep is that which produces or occasions
      incapacity of sensible perception; doubt is a state of mind
      produced by equality of contrary reasonings.<a name="FnAnchor9_300" href="#Footnote9_300"><span class="sp">300</span></a>

      bearing and reference to something different from what is
      enunciated in the definition. Thus, if the respondent defines
      justice — a power tending to make equal distribution, you may
      remark hereupon, that the just man is he who is deliberately
      resolved to make equal distribution, not he who has the power to
      do so. If this definition were allowed, the justest man would be

      admits graduation of More or Less, while that which is enunciated
      in the definition does not admit it, or <i>vice versâ</i>; also,
      if both of them admit graduation, but the variations of the two

      to enunciate its true correlate, or the true correlate of the
      genus to which it belongs. You must examine whether this is done,
      and whether the correlate enunciated be an ultimate end, as it
      ought to be (<i>i.e.</i> not merely a means towards something
      ulterior). If the correlate enunciated is a generation or a
      process, this will afford you an argument against the definition;
      for all generation or process is a means towards some ulterior
      end.<a name="FnAnchor9_306" href="#Footnote9_306"><span class="sp">306</span></a></p>

        He says that desire must be defined (not desire of <i>the

      the definiend; if any be omitted, the real essence is not

      Thus, if the definiend be a <i>relatum</i> corresponding, not to
      some correlate absolutely but, to some correlate specially

      quantification or qualification; if it does not, it is open to

    <p> 20. Suppose that the definiend is one of the appetites, relative
      to an <i>appetitum</i> as correlate, a mode of the good or
      agreeable. You will take notice whether the definition given
      thereof enunciates the correlate as only an apparent mode of good:
      if it does not, you have a <i>locus</i> for attacking it. But if
      it does, and if the definer be one who believes in the Platonic
      Ideas, you may attack him by showing that his definition will not
      square with that doctrine. For the definition as so given will not
      suit for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>ideal

      such definition, if good, implies in a certain way the definition

      definition will serve as definition to the Opposite of the
      definiend, as the definition of half is opposite to the definition
      of double; thus, if double is that which exceeds equality, half is
      that which is exceeded by equality. The like is true of
      Contraries: if the profitable be that which is productive of good,
      the hurtful will be that which is productive of evil or
      destructive of good. If, on trying the contraries, you find that
      this will not hold, the definition originally given will be found
      unsatisfactory.<a name="FnAnchor9_311" href="#Footnote9_311"><span class="sp">311</span></a> In defining the privative contrary
      of any term, a man cannot avoid enunciating in the definition the
      term of which it is the privative: but he is not allowed to define
      the term itself by means of its privative. To define equality —
      that which is contrary to inequality, is improper. You will
      require him at once to define inequality; and his definition must
      be — the privation of equality. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>Substitute this
      definition of the term inequality, in place of that term itself,
      in the above-named definition of equality: and the last definition
      will then run as follows: Equality is that which is contrary to
      the privation of equality. Here the definiend is enunciated as a
      part of the definition of itself; a proof that the original
      definition — Equality is the contrary of inequality — is itself

    <p> 24. When the definiend is a Privative Term, the definition given
      ought to enunciate that which it is, and that of which it is the
      privation; also that subject in which it resides naturally and in
      the first instance. In defining ignorance, the definition must
      enunciate not privation only, but privation of knowledge; nor will
      this be sufficient unless it be added that the privation of
      knowledge is in the rational department of the soul (&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183;
      &#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8183;). Privation of knowledge in the soul or in the man, will
      not suffice; because neither of these subjects is that in which
      the attribute resides in the first instance: the rational
      department of the soul must be named by itself, as being the
      primary subject of the attribute. If the definition be wanting in
      any of these conditions, you will have an argument for impeaching
      it.<a name="FnAnchor9_313" href="#Footnote9_313"><span class="sp">313</span></a></p>

    <p> 25. A term that is privative in form may sometimes be used in
      the sense of mere negation, not in that of privation. If this term
      be defined generally by privation, the definition will not include
      the merely negative sense, and will therefore be impeachable. The
      only general explanation attainable is that by pure negation,
      which is common both to the negative and the privative. Thus, if
      the respondent defines ignorance — privation of knowledge, such
      privation can be predicated only of subjects whose nature it is to
      have knowledge or who might be expected to have it: such privation
      cannot be predicated of infants, or of inanimate objects like
      stones. To include these, ignorance must be explained as the mere
      negation or non-existence of knowledge; the definition thereof by
      privation is inadequate.<a name="FnAnchor9_314" href="#Footnote9_314"><span class="sp">314</span></a></p>

      a part of his definition;<a name="FnAnchor9_315" href="#Footnote9_315"><span class="sp">315</span></a> but
      mortality cannot be predicated of the Idea or generic animal — the
      Self-animal; therefore, you will have an argument against his
      definition. In like manner, if any active or passive attribute is
      brought into his definition, you will object that this cannot
      apply to the Ideas; which are avowedly impassive and unchangeable.<a name="FnAnchor9_316" href="#Footnote9_316"><span class="sp">316</span></a></p>

    <p> 27. Another <i>locus</i> for counter-argument is, where the
      definiend is Equivocal or Analogous, while one and the same
      definition is made to apply to all its distinct meanings. Such a
      definition, pretending to fit all, will in reality fit none;
      nothing but an univocal term can come under one and the same
      definition. It is wrong to attempt to define an equivocal term.<a name="FnAnchor9_317" href="#Footnote9_317"><span class="sp">317</span></a>
      When its equivocation is not obvious, the respondent will put it
      forward confidently as univocal; while you as assailant will
      expose the equivocation. Sometimes, indeed, a respondent may
      pretend that an univocal word is equivocal, or that an equivocal
      word is univocal, in the course of the debate. To obviate such
      misconception, you will do well to come to an agreement with him
      prior to the debate, or to determine by special antecedent
      reasonings what terms are univocal or equivocal; for at that early
      stage, when he does not foresee the consequence of your questions,
      he is more likely to concede what will facilitate your attack. In
      the absence of such preliminary agreement, if the respondent, when
      you have shown that his bad definition will <span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>not apply
      universally, resorts to the pretence that the definiend, though
      really univocal, is equivocal, you will press him with the true
      definition of the part not included under his definition, and you
      will show that this true definition suits also for the remaining
      parts of the definiend. You will thus confute him by showing that,
      upon his original hypothesis, it must follow that there are two
      distinct definitions for the same definiend — the bad one which he
      has given, and the true one which you have constrained him to
      admit.<a name="FnAnchor9_318" href="#Footnote9_318"><span class="sp">318</span></a> Perhaps, however, the term which he
      has undertaken to define may be really equivocal, and therefore
      indefinable; nevertheless, when you have shown the insufficiency
      of his definition, he may refuse to admit that the term is
      equivocal, but will deny a portion of its real meaning. You will
      then remind him that, as to the meaning of names, we must
      recognize tradition and custom without presuming to disturb it;
      but that, when we combine these names in our own discourse, we
      must beware of those equivocations which mislead the multitude.<a name="FnAnchor9_319" href="#Footnote9_319"><span class="sp">319</span></a></p>

      <p> Aristotle here cites and censures the definition of life given
        by a philosopher named Dionysius; he remarks that life is an
        equivocal term, having one meaning in animals, another and a
        different one in plants. Dr. Whewell has remarked that even at
        the present day a good definition of life is matter of dispute,
        and still a desideratum with philosophers.</p>
      <p> Mr. John S. Mill adverts, in more than one portion of his
        ‘System of Logic’ (Bk. IV. ch. iii. s. 5, p. 222, seq.; Bk. V.
        ch. v. s. 8, p. 371), to the mistake and confusion arising from
        attempts to define Equivocal Terms. “The inquiries of Plato into
        the definitions of some of the most general terms of moral
        speculation, are characterized by Bacon as a far nearer approach
        to a true inductive method than is elsewhere to be found among
        the ancients, and are, indeed, almost perfect examples of the
        preparatory process of comparison and abstraction; but, from
        being unaware of the law just mentioned, he often wasted the
        powers of this great logical instrument on inquiries in which it
        could realize no result, since the phenomena, whose common
        properties he so elaborately endeavoured to detect, had not
        really any common properties. Bacon himself fell into the same
        error in his speculations on the nature of heat, in which he
        evidently confounded, under the name hot, classes of phenomena
        which had no property in common.” — “He occasionally proceeds
        like one who seeking for the cause of hardness, after examining
        that quality in iron, flint, and diamond, should expect to find
        that it is something that can be traced also in hard water, a
        hard knot, and a hard heart.”</p>

    <p> 28. If the definiend, of which a definition is tendered to you,
      is a compound, you may subtract from this definition the
      definition of one of the parts of the definiend, and then examine
      whether the remainder will suit as a definition of the remaining
      part of the definiend. If the remainder should not suit, this will
      show that the entire definition tendered is not tenable. Thus, if
      the definiend be a finite straight line, and if the definition
      tendered be, It is the boundary of a finite plane, of which
      (boundary) the middle covers or stands in the way of the
      extremities; you may subtract from this definition the definition
      of a finite line, viz., the boundary of a plane surface having
      boundaries, and the remainder of the definition ought then to suit
      for the remainder of the definiend. Now the remainder of the
      definiend is — straight; and the remainder of the definition is —
      that of which the middle covers or stands in the way of the
      extremities. But these two will <i>not</i> suit; for a line may
      be straight, yet infinite, in which case it will have neither
      middle nor extremities. Accordingly, since the remainder of the
      definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
      will not suit for the remainder of the definiend, this will serve
      as an argument that the entire definition tendered is not a good
      one.<a name="FnAnchor9_320" href="#Footnote9_320"><span class="sp">320</span></a></p>

    <p> If the definiend be a compound, and if the definition contain no
      greater number of words than the definiend, the definition must be
      faulty; it will be nothing better than a substitution of words.
      Still more faulty will it be, if it substitutes rare and strange
      words in place of others which are known and familiar; or if it
      introduces a new word which signifies something different from
      that which it replaces.<a name="FnAnchor9_321" href="#Footnote9_321"><span class="sp">321</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> The definiend, being compound, will contain both a generic and a
      differential term. In general, the generic term will be the better
      known of the two; yet sometimes the other is the better known.
      Whichever of the two is the better known, the definer ought to
      choose that, if all that he aims at is a mere substitution of one
      name in place of another. But, if he aims at something more or at
      the substitution of an explanatory proposition in place of a name
      (without which there can be no true definition), he ought then to
      choose the differentia in preference to the genus; for the
      definition is produced for the purpose of imparting knowledge, and
      the differentia, being usually less known than the genus, stands
      most in need of extraneous help to cognition.<a name="FnAnchor9_322" href="#Footnote9_322"><span class="sp">322</span></a>
      When the definition of the differentia has thus been tendered, you
      will examine whether it will be equally suitable for any other
      definiend also. If it be, you have an argument against the
      goodness of the definition. For example, the definition of odd
      number tendered to you may be — number having a middle. Here,
      since number is common both to the definiend and to the
      definition, having-a-middle is evidently put forward as the
      equivalent of odd. But this cannot stand as equivalent to odd;
      since various other subjects which are not odd (such, for example,
      as a body or a line), nevertheless have a middle. Since, then, we
      see that having-a-middle would be suitable in defining definiends
      which are not odd, it cannot be admitted, without some qualifying
      adjunct, as a good definition of odd. The adjunct annexed must
      declare in what sense middle is intended, since it is an equivocal
      phrase.<a name="FnAnchor9_323" href="#Footnote9_323"><span class="sp">323</span></a></p>

      definition given of it ought not to be a proposition declaring an
      incompatible combination, such as neither does nor can exist.
      Some, for example, define white — colour mingled with fire; which
      is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>incompatible,

      since that which is incorporeal (colour) cannot be mingled with a

    <p> 30. Again, suppose the definiend to be a <i>Relatum</i>: the
      correlate thereof must of course be declared in the definition.
      Care, however, must be taken that it shall be declared, not in
      vague generality but, distinctly and with proper specialization;
      otherwise, the definition will be incorrect either entirely or
      partially. Thus, if the respondent defines medicine — the science
      of the really existent, he is incorrect either wholly or
      partially. The <i>relatum</i> ought to reciprocate or to be
      co-extensive with its correlate.<a name="FnAnchor9_325" href="#Footnote9_325"><span class="sp">325</span></a> When the
      correlate, however, is properly specialized in the definition, it
      may be declared under several different descriptions; for the same
      real thing may be at once <i>ens</i>, <i>album</i>, <i>bonum</i>.
      None of these descriptions will be incorrect. Yet, if the
      correlate is thus described in the definition of a <i>relatum</i>,
      the definition cannot be considered good or sufficient. For it
      applies to more things besides the definiend; and a good
      definition ought to reciprocate or to be co-extensive with its
      definiend.<a name="FnAnchor9_326" href="#Footnote9_326"><span class="sp">326</span></a></p>

    <p> 31. Another mistake in defining is committed, when a man
      defines, not the subject purely and simply but, the subject in a
      high measure of excellence. Sometimes the rhetor (<i>e.g.</i>) is
      defined — one who can perceive and produce without omission all
      that there is plausible in any cause; the thief is defined — one
      who takes away secretly what belongs to another. But these are the
      definitions, not of a rhetor and a thief generally but, of a
      skilful rhetor and skilful thief. The thief is one who is bent on
      taking away secretly, not one who <i>does</i> take away secretly.<a name="FnAnchor9_327" href="#Footnote9_327"><span class="sp">327</span></a></p>

    <p> 32. Again, another error consists in defining what is desirable
      in itself and on its own account, as if it were desirable as a
      means towards some other end — as productive or preservative
      thereof. For example, if a man defines justice — that which is
      preservative of the laws; or wisdom — that which is productive of
      happiness, he presents them as if they were desirable, not for
      themselves but, with reference to something different from
      themselves. This is a mistake; and it is not less a mistake,
      though very possibly the same subject may be desirable both for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>itself
      and for the sake of something else. For the definition ought to
      enunciate what is best in the definiend; and the best of
      everything resides most in its essence, not in what it is
      relatively to something else. It is better to be desirable <i>per
        se</i>, than <i>alterius causâ</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_328" href="#Footnote9_328"><span class="sp">328</span></a></p>

    <p> 33. Perhaps the definition tendered may be a complex
      proposition, enunciating two terms either jointly or severally, in
      one or other of three combinations. Either the definiend is A and

    <p> <i>a.</i> Thus, take the first of the three. Suppose the
      respondent to define justice by saying, It is temperance and
      courage. You may urge against him, that two men, one of whom is
      temperate without being courageous, while the other is courageous
      without being temperate, will be just together, though neither of
      them separately is just; nay, that each of them separately (the
      one being temperate and cowardly, the other courageous and
      intemperate), will be both just and unjust; since, if justice is
      temperance and courage, injustice will be intemperance and
      cowardice.<a name="FnAnchor9_330" href="#Footnote9_330"><span class="sp">330</span></a> The definer is open to the farther
      objection that he treats enumeration of parts as identical with
      the whole; as if he defined a house — bricks and mortar,
      forgetting the peculiar mode of putting them together. Bricks and
      mortar may exist, and yet there may be no house.<a name="FnAnchor9_331" href="#Footnote9_331"><span class="sp">331</span></a></p>

    </div>
      <p> <i>b.</i> Next, suppose the definition to declare, that the
      definiend is that which springs from A and B — is a result or
      compound of A and B. You will then examine whether A and B are
      such as to yield any result; for some couples (as a line and a
      number) yield no result. Or, perhaps, the definiend may by its own
      nature inhere in some first subject, while A and B do not inhere
      in any one first subject, but one in the other; in which case the
      definition is assailable.<a name="FnAnchor9_332" href="#Footnote9_332"><span class="sp">332</span></a> Or, even
      granting that it is the nature of A and B to inhere in the same
      first subject, you may find that that first subject is not the
      same as the one in which the definiend inheres. Now the whole
      cannot thus inhere in one, and the parts in another: you will here
      have a good objection. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>Or, perhaps, it may appear that, if
      the whole be destroyed, the parts will be destroyed also; which
      ought not to be, but the reverse; for, when the parts are
      destroyed, the whole must necessarily vanish. Or, perhaps, the
      definiend may be good or bad, while the parts of the definition (A
      and B) are neither one nor the other. (Yet this last is not a
      conclusive objection; for it will sometimes happen in compound
      medicines that each of the ingredients is good, while they are bad
      if given in conjunction.)<a name="FnAnchor9_333" href="#Footnote9_333"><span class="sp">333</span></a> Or,
      perhaps, the whole may bear the same name as one of its parts:
      this, also, will render the definition impeachable. Still more
      will it be impeachable, if it enunciates simply a result or
      compound of A and B, without specifying the manner of composition;
      it ought to declare not merely the parts of the compound, but also
      the way in which they are put together to form the compound.<a name="FnAnchor9_334" href="#Footnote9_334"><span class="sp">334</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> <i>c.</i> Lastly, suppose the definition to declare that the
      definiend is A along with B. You will note, first, that this third
      head must be identical either with the first or with the second (<i>e.g.</i>,
      honey <i>with</i> water means either honey and water, or the
      compound of honey with water); it will therefore be open to
      impeachment on one or other of the above-named grounds of
      objection, according as the respondent may admit.<a name="FnAnchor9_335" href="#Footnote9_335"><span class="sp">335</span></a>
      You may also distinguish all the different senses in which one
      thing may be said to be <i>with</i> another (<i>e.g.</i>, when
      the two are in the same recipient, justice and courage together in
      the soul; or in the same place; or in the same time), and you may
      be able to show that in none of these senses can the two parts of
      the definition be truly said to be one along with the other.<a name="FnAnchor9_336" href="#Footnote9_336"><span class="sp">336</span></a>
      Or, if it be true that these two parts are co-existent in time,
      you may enquire whether they are not affirmed with relation to
      different correlates. <i>E.g.</i>, The definition of courage may
      be tendered thus: Courage is daring along with right intelligence;
      upon which you may remark that daring may have reference to an act
      of spoliation, and that right intelligence may have reference to
      the preservation of health. Now a man who has both daring and
      right intelligence in <i>these</i> senses, cannot be termed
      courageous, and thus you will have an argument against the
      definition. And, even if they be affirmed with reference to the
      same correlate (<i>e.g.</i>, the duties of a physician), a man who
      has both daring and right intelligence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>in reference to
      these duties will hardly be styled courageous; the term courage
      must be so defined as to have reference to its appropriate end; <i>e.g.</i>,
      the dangers of war, or any still more public-spirited end.<a name="FnAnchor9_337" href="#Footnote9_337"><span class="sp">337</span></a>
      Another mistake may, perhaps, be committed in this same sort of
      definition — A along with B; as when, for example, the definition
      tendered of anger is — pain along with the belief of being treated
      with contempt. What the definer really intends here is, that the
      pain arises from the belief of being treated with contempt. But
      this is not expressed by the terms of his definition, in any one
      of their admissible meanings.<a name="FnAnchor9_338" href="#Footnote9_338"><span class="sp">338</span></a> </p>

    <p> 34. Perhaps the definition, while including two or more distinct
      parts, may be tendered in this form: The definiend is the
      composition of A and B; <i>e.g.</i>, animal is the composition of
      soul and body. You will first note that the definer has not
      declared what sort of composition. There is a great difference
      between one mode of composition and another; the mode must be
      specialized. Both flesh and bone may be defined — a composition of
      fire, earth, and water; but one mode of composition makes flesh,
      another makes bone, out of these same elements. You may also take
      the farther objection that to define a compound as composition is
      erroneous; the two are essentially disparate, one of them being
      abstract, the other concrete.<a name="FnAnchor9_339" href="#Footnote9_339"><span class="sp">339</span></a></p>

    <p> 35. If the definiend be in its nature capable of receiving two
      contrary attributes, and if the respondent define it by one or
      other of them, you have an argument against him. If one of them is
      admissible, the other must be equally so; and upon this
      supposition there would be two distinct definitions of the same
      subject; which has been already declared impossible. Thus, it is
      wrong to define the soul as a substance which is recipient of
      knowledge; the soul is also recipient of ignorance.<a name="FnAnchor9_340" href="#Footnote9_340"><span class="sp">340</span></a></p>

    <p> 36. Perhaps the definiend is not sufficiently well known to
      enable you to attack the definition as a whole, but you may find
      arguments against one or other of its parts; this is sufficient to
      upset it. If it be obscure and unintelligible, you should help to
      correct and re-model it until it becomes clear; you will then see
      what are the really assailable points in it. When you indicate and
      expose the obscurity, the respondent must either substitute some
      clearer exposition of his own meaning, or else he must acquiesce
      in that which you propose <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>as substitute.<a name="FnAnchor9_341" href="#Footnote9_341"><span class="sp">341</span></a>
      If the improved definition which you propose is obviously clearer
      and better, his previous definition is of course put out of court;
      since there cannot be several definitions of the same subject.<a name="FnAnchor9_342" href="#Footnote9_342"><span class="sp">342</span></a></p>

    <p> To conclude, one suggestion may be given bearing upon all the
      arguments that you have to carry on against definitions tendered
      by respondents:— Reflect on the definiend, and frame a definition
      of it for yourself, as cleverly as you can at the moment; or call
      to mind any good definition of it which you may have heard before.
      This will serve you as a standard with which to compare the
      definition tendered, so that you will see at once what there is in
      it either defective or redundant, and where you can find arguments
      against it.<a name="FnAnchor9_343" href="#Footnote9_343"><span class="sp">343</span></a></p>

    <h2>VII.</h2>
    <p> In the Seventh Book of the Topica Aristotle continues his review
      of the manner of debating theses which profess to define, but
      enters also on a collateral question connected with that
      discussion: viz., By what arguments are we to determine whether
      two Subjects or Predicates are the same <i>Numero</i> (<i>modo
        maxime proprio</i>), as distinguished from being the same merely
      <i>Specie</i> or <i>Genere</i>? To measure the extent of identity
      between any two subjects, is important towards the attack and
      defence of a definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_344" href="#Footnote9_344"><span class="sp">344</span></a></p>

    <p> Two subjects (A and B) being affirmed as the same <i>numero</i>,
      you may test this by examining the Derivatives, the Co-ordinates,
      and the Opposites, of each. Thus, if courage is identical with
      justice, the courageous man will be identical with the just man;
      courageously will be identical with justly. Likewise, the opposite
      of courage (in all the four modes of Opposition) will be identical
      with the opposite of justice. Then, again, the generators and
      destroyers, the generations and destructions, of courage, will be
      identical with those of justice.<a name="FnAnchor9_345" href="#Footnote9_345"><span class="sp">345</span></a> If there
      be any predicate applied to courage in the superlative degree, the
      same predicate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>will also be applied to justice in
      the superlative degree.<a name="FnAnchor9_346" href="#Footnote9_346"><span class="sp">346</span></a> If there
      be a third subject C with which A is identical, B also will be
      identical therewith. The same attributes predicable of A will also
      be predicable of B; and, if the two be attributes, each will be
      predicable of the same subjects of which the other is predicable.
      Both will be comprised in the same Category, and will have the
      same genus and differentia. Both will increase or diminish under
      the same circumstances. Each, when added to or subtracted from any
      third subject, will yield the same result.<a name="FnAnchor9_347" href="#Footnote9_347"><span class="sp">347</span></a></p>

      <p> Aristotle remarks that Xenokrates here carried his inference

        to A and B affords indeed a presumption that they are <i>Idem
          numero</i>, but not a conclusive proof thereof; that the
        predicate might be applied in like manner, if B were a species
        comprised in A as genus.</p>
      <p> Xenokrates made the mistake of drawing an affirmative
        conclusion from syllogistic premisses in the Second figure.</p>

    <p> Farther, in examining the thesis (A is identical <i>numero</i>

      impossible consequences, but also whether any cases can be
      imagined in which it would involve such;<a name="FnAnchor9_348" href="#Footnote9_348"><span class="sp">348</span></a> whether
      the identity is not merely <i>specie</i> or <i>genere</i>;

        Ibid. b. 17-24. Aristotle illustrates this <i>locus</i> as
        follows:— Some say that to be <i>void</i>, and to be <i>full
          of air</i>, are the same. But suppose the air to be drawn
        away; then the place will no longer be full of air, yet it will
        still be void, even more than it was before. One of the two
        terms declared to be identical is thus withdrawn, while the
        other remains. Accordingly, the two are not really identical.
        This illustration fits better to the principle laid down, b. 34:

      characteristic of this is to declare that the defining proposition
      is equivalent or identical with the defined name; and, if you can
      disprove such identity, you upset the definition. But these <i>loci</i>
      will be of little avail, if your task is to defend or uphold a
      definition; for, even if you succeed in establishing the
      above-mentioned identity, the definition may still be open to
      attack for other weaknesses or defects.<a name="FnAnchor9_350" href="#Footnote9_350"><span class="sp">350</span></a></p>

    <p> To uphold, or prove by way of syllogism, requires a different
      procedure. It is a task hard, but not impossible. Most disputants
      assume without proving their definition, in the same <span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>way
      as the teachers of Geometry and Arithmetic do in their respective
      sciences. Aristotle tells us that he does not here intend to give
      a didactic exposition of Definition, nor of the proper way of
      defining accurately or scientifically. To do this (he says)
      belongs to the province of Analytic; while in the present treatise
      he is dealing merely with Dialectic. For the purposes, then, of
      Dialectic, he declares that syllogistic proof of a definition is
      practicable, inasmuch as the definition is only a proposition
      declaring what is essential to the definiend; and nothing is
      essential except genus (or genera) and differentiæ.<a name="FnAnchor9_351" href="#Footnote9_351"><span class="sp">351</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> Towards the establishment of the definition which you have to
      defend, you may find arguments by examining the Contraries and
      Opposites of the component terms, and of the defining proposition.
      If the opposite of the definition is allowed as defining properly
      the opposite of the definiend, you may argue from hence that your
      own definition is a good one.<a name="FnAnchor9_352" href="#Footnote9_352"><span class="sp">352</span></a> If you can
      show that there is declared in your definition a partial
      correspondence of contraries either separately in the genus, or
      separately in the differentia, you have a certain force of
      argument in your favour; and, if you can make out both the two
      separately, this will suffice for your entire definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_353" href="#Footnote9_353"><span class="sp">353</span></a>
      You may also draw arguments from the Derivatives, or Co-ordinates
      of your own terms; from Analogous Terms, or from Comparates (More
      or Less). If the definition of any one of these is granted to you,
      an argument is furnished for the defence of an analogous
      definition in the case of your own term. If it is conceded as a
      good definition that forgetfulness is — the casting away of
      knowledge, then the definition must also hold good that to forget
      is — to cast away knowledge. If destruction is admitted to be well
      defined — dissolution of essence, then to be destroyed is well
      defined — to be dissolved as to essence. If the wholesome may be
      defined — that which is productive of health, then also the
      profitable may be defined — that which is productive of good; that
      is, if the declaration of the special end makes a good definition
      in one case, so it will also in the other.<a name="FnAnchor9_354" href="#Footnote9_354"><span class="sp">354</span></a></p>

      tendered to him by calling to mind particulars and sub-species, so
      as to determine whether the definition fits them all. Such a

    <p> These last observations are addressed to the questioner or
      assailant of the definition. We have already seen however that his
      task is comparatively easy; the grand difficulty is to defend a
      definition. The respondent cannot at once see what he ought to aim
      at; and, even when he does see it, he has farther difficulty in
      obtaining the requisite concessions from his opponent, who may
      decline to grant that the two parts of the definition tendered are
      really the genus and differentia of the definiend; while, if there
      be any thing besides these two parts contained in the essence of
      the definiend, there is an excuse for declining to grant it.<a name="FnAnchor9_356" href="#Footnote9_356"><span class="sp">356</span></a>
      The opponent succeeds, if he can establish one single
      contradictory instance; accordingly, a syllogism with particular
      conclusion will serve his purpose. The respondent on the other
      hand, must meet each one of these instances, must establish an
      universal conclusion, and must show that his definition
      reciprocates with the definiend, so that, wherever the latter is
      predicable, the former is predicable likewise, and not in any
      other case whatever.<a name="FnAnchor9_357" href="#Footnote9_357"><span class="sp">357</span></a></p>

    <p> So much greater are the difficulties belonging to the defence of
      a Definition, as compared with the attack upon it; and the same
      may be said about attack and defence of a Proprium, and of a
      Genus. In both cases, the assailant will carry his point, if he
      can show that the predicate in question is not predicable, in this
      relation, of all, or that it is not predicable, in this relation,
      of any one. But the defendant is required to make good the
      universal against every separate objection advanced against any
      one of the particulars. It is a general rule, that the work of
      destruction is easier than that of construction; and the present
      cases come under that rule.<a name="FnAnchor9_358" href="#Footnote9_358"><span class="sp">358</span></a> The
      hardest of all theses to defend, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>and the easiest to
      overthrow, is where Definition is affirmed; for the respondent in
      this case is required to declare well the essence of his subject,
      and he stands in need of the greatest number of auxiliary data;
      while all the <i>Loci</i> for attack, even those properly
      belonging to the Proprium, the Genus, and the Accident, are
      available against him.<a name="FnAnchor9_359" href="#Footnote9_359"><span class="sp">359</span></a> Next in
      order, as regards difficulty of defence, comes the theses
      affirming Proprium; where the respondent has to make out, not
      merely that the predicate belongs to the subject, but that it
      belongs thereunto exclusively and reciprocally: here also all the
      <i>Loci</i> for attack, even those properly belonging to Accident,
      are available.<a name="FnAnchor9_360" href="#Footnote9_360"><span class="sp">360</span></a> Easiest of all theses to defend,
      while it is the hardest to impugn, is that in which Accident alone
      is affirmed — the naked fact, that the predicate A belongs to the
      Subject B, without investing it with the character either of Genus
      or Proprium. Here what is affirmed is a minimum, requiring the
      smallest array of data to be conceded; moreover, the <i>Loci</i>
      available for attack are the fewest, since many of those which may
      be employed against Genus, Proprium, and Definition, have no
      application against a thesis affirming merely Accident.<a name="FnAnchor9_361" href="#Footnote9_361"><span class="sp">361</span></a>
      Indeed, if the thesis affirmed be only a proposition particular
      (and not universal), affirming Accident (and nothing more), the
      task of refuting it will be more difficult than that of
      maintaining it.<a name="FnAnchor9_362" href="#Footnote9_362"><span class="sp">362</span></a></p>

    <h2>VIII.</h2>
    <p> The Eighth Book of the Topica brings our attention back to the
      general considerations contained in the First. In the intervening
      part of the treatise we have had the quadruple distribution of
      dialectical problems, with the enumeration of those <i>Loci</i>
      of argument which bear upon each or all: we are now invited to
      study the application of these distinctions in practice, and with
      this view to look once more both at the persons and the purposes
      of dialectical debate. What is the order of procedure most
      suitable, first, for the questioner or assailant; next, for the
      respondent or defender?<a name="FnAnchor9_363" href="#Footnote9_363"><span class="sp">363</span></a> This order
      of procedure marks <span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>the distinctive line of separation
      between the dialectician and the man of science or philosopher: to
      both of them the <i>Loci</i> of arguments are alike available,
      though each of them deals with those arguments in his own way, and
      in an arrangement suitable for his purpose.<a name="FnAnchor9_364" href="#Footnote9_364"><span class="sp">364</span></a> The
      dialectician, being engaged in debate, must shape his questions,
      and regulate his march as questioner, according to the concessions
      obtained or likely to be obtained from his respondent; who, if a
      question be asked having an obvious refutative bearing on the
      thesis, will foresee the consequences of answering in the
      affirmative, and will refuse to grant what is asked. On the
      contrary, the philosopher, who pursues investigation with a view
      to his own satisfaction alone, is under no similar restriction. He
      looks out at once for such premisses as conduct straight to a
      conclusion; and, the more obvious their bearing on the conclusion
      is, the more scientific will the syllogism be, and the better will
      he be pleased.<a name="FnAnchor9_365" href="#Footnote9_365"><span class="sp">365</span></a></p>

    <p> In the <i>praxis dialectica</i> (as has already been stated)
      two talkers are assumed — the respondent who sets up a thesis
      which he undertakes to defend, and a questioner who interrogates
      with a view to impugn it; or at least with a view to compel the
      other to answer in an inconsistent or contradictory manner. We are
      to assume, farther, a circle of listeners, who serve to a certain
      extent as guarantees against any breach of the rules of debate.<a name="FnAnchor9_366" href="#Footnote9_366"><span class="sp">366</span></a>
      Three distinct purposes may be supposed in the debate. 1. You as a
      questioner may be a teacher, and the respondent a learner; your
      purpose is to teach what you know, while he wishes to learn from
      you what he does not know. 2. You engage in an intellectual
      contest or duel with the respondent, each of you seeking only
      victory over the other, though subject on both sides to observance
      of the rules of debate. 3. You neither seek to teach, nor to
      conquer; you and the respondent have both the same purpose — to
      test the argumentative consequences of different admissions, and
      to acquire a larger command of the chains of reasoning <i>pro</i>
      and <i>con</i>, bearing on some given topic.<a name="FnAnchor9_367" href="#Footnote9_367"><span class="sp">367</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> According as the aim of the talkers is one or other of these
      three, the good or bad conduct of the dialogue, on the part both
      of questioner and of respondent, must be differently appreciated.
      Of each of the three, specimens may be found in Plato, though not
      carefully severed but running one into the other. Aristotle <span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>appears

      to have been the first to formulate the distinction theoretically,
      and to prescribe for the practice of each separately. He tells us
      particularly that no one before him had clearly distinguished the
      third head, and prescribed for it apart from the second. The merit
      of having first done this he expressly claims for the Topica.<a name="FnAnchor9_368" href="#Footnote9_368"><span class="sp">368</span></a></p>

    <p> Both the questioner and the respondent have a duty towards the
      dialogue; their common purpose is to conduct it well, not only
      obeying the peremptory rules, but displaying, over and above,
      skill for the attainment of their separate ends. Under the first
      and third heads, both may be alike successful. Under the second or
      contentious head, indeed, one only of the two can gain the
      victory; yet, still, even the defeated party may exhibit the
      maximum of skill which his position admits. This is sufficient for
      his credit; so that the common work will still be well performed.<a name="FnAnchor9_369" href="#Footnote9_369"><span class="sp">369</span></a>
      But a partner who performs his own part so as to obstruct instead
      of forwarding this common work — who conducts the debate in a
      spirit of ill-tempered contention rather than of regular Dialectic
      — deserves censure.<a name="FnAnchor9_370" href="#Footnote9_370"><span class="sp">370</span></a></p>

    <p> Having thus in view the dialogue as a partnership for common
      profit, Aristotle administers counsel to the questioning as well
      as to the responding partner. You as questioner have to deal with
      a thesis set up by the respondent. You see at once what the
      syllogism is that is required to prove the contrary or
      contradictory of that thesis; and your business is so to shape
      your questions as to induce the respondent to concede the
      premisses necessary towards that syllogism. If you ask him at once
      and directly to concede these premisses, he sees your drift and
      answers in the negative. You must therefore begin your approaches
      from a greater distance. You must ask questions bearing only
      indirectly and remotely upon your ultimate conclusion.<a name="FnAnchor9_371" href="#Footnote9_371"><span class="sp">371</span></a>
      These outlying and preparatory questions will fall under four
      principal heads. Either (1) they will be inductive particulars,
      multiplied in order that you may obtain assent to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>an
      universal comprising them all; or (2) they will be put for the
      purpose of giving dignity to your discourse; or (3) they will be
      shaped with a view to conceal or keep out of sight the ultimate
      conclusion that you aim at; or (4), lastly, they will be
      introduced to make your whole argument clearer.<a name="FnAnchor9_372" href="#Footnote9_372"><span class="sp">372</span></a>
      The third of these four general heads — the head of questions for
      the purpose of concealment — comes out principally in dialectical
      contests for victory. In those it is of supreme importance, and
      the result depends much on the employment of it; but even in other
      dialectical debates you must employ it to a certain extent.<a name="FnAnchor9_373" href="#Footnote9_373"><span class="sp">373</span></a></p>

    <p> Aristotle goes at great length into the means of Concealment.
      Suppose the proposition which you desire to get conceded is, The
      science of two contraries is the same. You will find it useful to
      commence by a question more general: <i>e.g.</i>, Is the science
      of two opposites the same? If the respondent answers in the
      affirmative, you will deduce from his concession, by syllogism,
      the conclusion which you desire. If he answers in the negative,
      you must then try to arrive at your end by a string of questions
      respecting particular contraries or opposites; which if the
      respondent grants successively, you will bring in your general
      question ultimately as the inductive result from those
      concessions.<a name="FnAnchor9_374" href="#Footnote9_374"><span class="sp">374</span></a> Your particulars must be selected
      from obvious matters of sense and notoriety. You are likely to
      obtain in this way admissions which will serve as premisses for
      several different prosyllogisms, not indeed sufficient by
      themselves, yet valuable as conditions and preliminaries to the
      final syllogism whereby the thesis is refuted. For, when the
      questions are put in this way, the respondent will not see your
      drift nor the consequences of his own concessions; so that he will
      more readily concede what you want.<a name="FnAnchor9_375" href="#Footnote9_375"><span class="sp">375</span></a> The better
      to conceal your purpose, you will refrain from drawing out any of
      these prosyllogisms clearly at once; you will not even put the
      major and minor premiss of any one of them in immediate sequence;
      but you will confound the order of them intentionally, stating
      first a premiss belonging to one, and next a premiss belonging to
      another.<a name="FnAnchor9_376" href="#Footnote9_376"><span class="sp">376</span></a> The respondent, thus kept in the
      dark, answers in the affirmative to each of your questions
      successively. At length you find that you have obtained a
      sufficient number of concessions from him, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>to enable you to
      prove the syllogism contradictory of his thesis. You inform him of
      this; and it shows the perfect skill and success of your
      procedure, when he expresses surprise at the announcement, and
      asks on what premisses you reckon.<a name="FnAnchor9_377" href="#Footnote9_377"><span class="sp">377</span></a></p>

    <p> There are also other manœuvres serving your purpose of
      concealment, and preventing the respondent from seeing beforehand
      the full pertinence of your questions. Thus, if you wish to obtain
      the definition of your major, you will do well to ask the
      definition, not of the term itself but, of some one among its
      conjugates. You will put your question, as if the answer were of
      little importance in itself, and as if you did not care whether it
      was given in the affirmative or in the negative;<a name="FnAnchor9_378" href="#Footnote9_378"><span class="sp">378</span></a>
      you will sometimes even suggest objections to that which you are
      seeming to aim at. All this will give you the air of a candid
      disputant; it will throw the respondent off his guard, and make
      him more ready to answer as he really thinks, without alarm for
      the consequences.<a name="FnAnchor9_379" href="#Footnote9_379"><span class="sp">379</span></a> When you wish to get a certain
      premiss conceded, you will put the question first upon a different
      premiss analogous to it. In putting your question, you will add
      that the answer which you desire is a matter of course, familiar
      and admitted by every one; for respondents are shy of
      contradicting any received belief, unless they have present to
      their minds a clear instance adverse to it.<a name="FnAnchor9_380" href="#Footnote9_380"><span class="sp">380</span></a> You will
      never manifest apparent earnestness about an answer; which would
      make the respondent less willing to concede it.<a name="FnAnchor9_381" href="#Footnote9_381"><span class="sp">381</span></a>
      You will postpone until the last the premiss which you wish to
      obtain, and will begin by putting questions the answers to which
      serve as remote premisses behind it, only in the end conducting to
      it as consequence. Generally speaking, questioners do the reverse,
      putting first the questions about which they are most anxious;
      while most respondents, aware of this habit, are most intractable
      in regard to the first questions, except some presumptuous and
      ill-tempered disputants, who concede what is asked at first but
      afterwards become obstinate in denegation.<a name="FnAnchor9_382" href="#Footnote9_382"><span class="sp">382</span></a> You will
      throw in some irrelevant questions with a view to lengthen the
      procedure, like <span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>fallacious geometers who complicate
      a diagram by drawing unnecessary lines. Amidst a multitude of
      premisses falsehood is more likely to escape detection; and thus,
      also, you may perhaps be able to slip in, unperceived and in a
      corner, some important premiss, which, if put as a separate
      question by itself, would certainly not have been granted.<a name="FnAnchor9_383" href="#Footnote9_383"><span class="sp">383</span></a></p>

    <p> Such are the multifarious suggestions addressed by Aristotle to
      the questioner for concealing his method of attack;<a name="FnAnchor9_384" href="#Footnote9_384"><span class="sp">384</span></a>
      Concealment being the third of the four general heads relating to
      the treatment of premisses not immediately necessary for proof of
      the final refutative conclusion. On the other three general heads
      — Induction from particulars to an universal, Dignity, Clearness —
      Aristotle goes into less detail. For Clearness, he recommends that
      examples should be introduced; especially familiar examples, taken
      from well-known poets like Homer, not from obscure poets like
      Chœrilus.<a name="FnAnchor9_385" href="#Footnote9_385"><span class="sp">385</span></a></p>

    <p> In regard to Induction, Aristotle points out an embarrassment
      often arising from the want of suitable universal names. When,
      after having obtained an affirmative answer about several similar
      particulars, you wish to put a question generalizing the result,
      you will sometimes find no universal term fitting the position.
      You are obliged to say: Will it not be so in all such cases? and
      this lets in a serious difficulty, how to know what other cases
      are like, and what are not. Here the respondent will often dispute
      your right to include this or that other particular.<a name="FnAnchor9_386" href="#Footnote9_386"><span class="sp">386</span></a>
      You will do well to coin a new universal term fitting the
      situation. </p>

    <p> If the respondent answers in the affirmative to several
      questions of similar particulars, but answers in the negative when
      you sum them up in an universal comprehending all similar cases, —
      you may require him to cite some particular case justifying his
      denial; though you cannot require him to do this before he has
      made the affirmative answers.<a name="FnAnchor9_387" href="#Footnote9_387"><span class="sp">387</span></a> It is not
      sufficient that he should cite, as the single case of exception,
      the express case which forms the subject of the thesis: He ought
      to produce some distinct and independent instance, really
      comprised within the genus, and not merely connected with it by
      the link of an equivocal term.<a name="FnAnchor9_388" href="#Footnote9_388"><span class="sp">388</span></a> If he
      produces an adverse instance really comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span> within the genus,
      you may perhaps be able to re-model your question, so as to make
      reserve for the basis on which this objection is founded. The
      respondent will then be compelled (unless he can foresee some new
      case of objection) to concede the universal with this special
      qualification; so that you will have gained all that you really
      require. Should the respondent continue to refuse, without
      producing any new case, he will transgress the rules of Dialectic;
      which recognize an universal affirmative, wherever there are
      numerous affirmative particulars without one assignable negative.<a name="FnAnchor9_389" href="#Footnote9_389"><span class="sp">389</span></a>
      Indeed, if you know the universal to hold in many particular
      cases, and do not know of any others adverse, you may boldly put
      your question at once in reference to the universal (without going
      first through the series of particulars). The respondent will
      hardly venture to deny it, not having in his mind any negative
      particulars.<a name="FnAnchor9_390" href="#Footnote9_390"><span class="sp">390</span></a></p>

    <p> You must however keep in mind what a dialectic universal premiss
      really is. Not every question requiring an universal answer is
      allowed to be put. You must not ask for positive information, nor
      put such questions as the following: What is man? In how many
      different senses is good employed? A dialectic question is one to
      which the respondent makes sufficient reply by saying, Yes or No.<a name="FnAnchor9_391" href="#Footnote9_391"><span class="sp">391</span></a>
      You must ask in this form: Is the definition of man so and so? Is
      good enunciated in this or that different sense? To these
      questions the respondent may answer Yes or No. But if he persists
      in negative answers to your multiplied questions as to this or
      that sense of the term good, you may perhaps stand excused for
      asking him: “In how many different senses, then, do you yourself
      use the term good?”<a name="FnAnchor9_392" href="#Footnote9_392"><span class="sp">392</span></a></p>

    <p> When you have obtained concessions which furnish premisses for a
      formal syllogism, you will draw out and propound that syllogism
      and its conclusion forthwith, without asking any farther question
      from the respondent or any leave from him to do so. He may indeed
      deny your right to do this, in spite of the concessions which he
      has made; and the auditors around, not fully appreciating all his
      concessions, may perhaps think that he is entitled to deny it.
      But, if you ask his leave to draw out the syllogism and he refuses

    <p> You must not persevere long in the same line of questions. For,
      if the respondent answers them all, it will soon appear that you
      are in the wrong course, since your syllogism, if you can get one
      at all, will always be obtained from a small number of premisses;
      and, if the respondent will not answer them, you have no
      alternative except to protest and desist.<a name="FnAnchor9_395" href="#Footnote9_395"><span class="sp">395</span></a></p>

    <p> The theses that are most difficult to attack are also most easy
      to defend; and these are the highest universals, and the lowest
      particulars. The highest you cannot deal with, unless you can get
      a definition of them; which is sometimes impossible and always
      difficult; since the respondent will neither define them himself
      nor accept your definitions. Those which are next to the highest
      are also difficult to impugn, because there are few intermediate
      steps of proof. Again, the lowest particulars are also difficult
      for the contrary reason, that there are so many intermediate
      steps, and it is tedious to enumerate them all continuously;
      while, if any are omitted, the demonstration is incomplete, and
      the procedure will appear sophistical.<a name="FnAnchor9_396" href="#Footnote9_396"><span class="sp">396</span></a> The most
      difficult of all to impugn are definitions framed in vague and
      unintelligible terms, where you do not know whether they are
      univocal or equivocal, literal or metaphorical. When the thesis
      tendered to you presents such difficulty, you may presume that it
      is affected with the obscurity of terms here indicated; or, at any
      rate, that its terms stand in need of definition.<a name="FnAnchor9_397" href="#Footnote9_397"><span class="sp">397</span></a>
      In geometrical construction, as well as in dialectical debate, it
      is indispensable that the <i>principia</i> or primary terms

    <p> Sometimes the major and minor premisses of your syllogistic
      conclusion are more difficult to establish — more beyond the level
      of average intelligence — than the thesis itself. In such a case
      some may think that the respondent ought to grant these premisses,
      because, if he refuses and requires them to be proved, he will be
      imposing upon the questioner a duty more arduous than the thesis
      itself imposes; others may say that he ought not to grant them,
      because, if he did, he would be acknowledging a conclusion derived
      from premisses requiring proof as much or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>more than itself.<a name="FnAnchor9_399" href="#Footnote9_399"><span class="sp">399</span></a>
      A distinction must here be made. If you are putting questions with
      a view to teach, the learner ought not to grant such premisses as
      those above described, because he is entitled to require that in
      every step of the process he shall be inducted from what is more
      knowable to what is less knowable. Accordingly, when you attempt
      to demonstrate to him something which he knows little, by
      requiring him to concede something which he knows still less, he
      cannot be advised to grant what you ask. But, if you are debating
      with a companion for the purpose of dialectical exercise, he ought
      to grant what you ask whenever the affirmative really appears to
      him true.<a name="FnAnchor9_400" href="#Footnote9_400"><span class="sp">400</span></a></p>

    <p> We have now said enough for the purpose of instructing the
      questioner how to frame and marshal his interrogations. We must
      turn to the respondent, and point out how <i>he</i> must answer
      in order to do well and perform his duty to the common work of
      dialogue. Speaking generally, the task of the questioner is to
      conduct the dialogue so as to make the respondent enunciate the
      most improbable and absurd replies which follow necessarily from
      the thesis that he has undertaken to defend; while the task of the
      respondent is to make it appear that these absurdities follow from
      the thesis itself, and not from his manner of defending it. The
      respondent may err in one of two ways, or indeed in both together:
      either he may set up an indefensible thesis; or he may fail to
      defend it in the best manner that it really admits; or he may do
      both. The second is a worse error than the first, in reference to
      the general purpose of Dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor9_401" href="#Footnote9_401"><span class="sp">401</span></a></p>

    <p> Aristotle distinguishes (as has been already stated) three
      purposes in the dialogue:— (1) Teaching and Learning; (2)
      Contention, where both questioner and respondent strive only for
      victory; (3) Investigating and Testing the consequences of some
      given doctrine.<a name="FnAnchor9_402" href="#Footnote9_402"><span class="sp">402</span></a> The first two of these three are
      dismissed rapidly. In the first, the teaching questioner has no
      intention of deceiving, and the pupil respondent has only to
      answer by granting all that appears to him true.<a name="FnAnchor9_403" href="#Footnote9_403"><span class="sp">403</span></a>
      In the second, Aristotle tells us only that the questioner must
      always appear as if he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>were making some point of his own;
      while the respondent, on his side, must always appear as if no
      point were made against him.<a name="FnAnchor9_404" href="#Footnote9_404"><span class="sp">404</span></a> But in
      regard to the third head — dialogues of Search, Testing, Exercise
      — he is more copious in suggestions: he considers these as the
      proper field of Dialectic, and, as we saw, claims to have been the
      first who treated them apart from the didactic dialogues on one
      side, and the contentious on the other.<a name="FnAnchor9_405" href="#Footnote9_405"><span class="sp">405</span></a></p>

    <p> The thesis which the respondent undertakes to defend (in a
      dialogue of Search or Testing) must be either probable, or
      improbable, or neither one nor the other. The probability or
      improbability may be either simple and absolute, or special and
      relative — in the estimation of the respondent himself or of some
      one or more persons. Now, if the thesis be improbable, the
      opposite thereof, which you the questioner try to prove, must be
      probable; if the thesis be probable, the opposite thereof must be
      improbable; if the thesis be neither, its opposite will also be
      neither. Suppose, first, that the thesis is improbable absolutely.
      In that case, its opposite, which you the questioner must fish for
      premisses to prove, will be probable; the respondent therefore
      ought not to grant you any demand which is either simply
      improbable or less probable than the conclusion which you aim at
      proving; for no such concessions can really serve your purpose,
      since you are bound to prove your conclusion from premisses more
      probable than itself.<a name="FnAnchor9_406" href="#Footnote9_406"><span class="sp">406</span></a> Suppose, next, that the thesis is
      probable absolutely. In that case, the opposite conclusion, which
      you have to make out, will be improbable absolutely. Accordingly,
      whenever you ask concessions that are probable, the respondent
      ought to grant them; whenever you ask for concessions that are
      less improbable than your intended conclusion, he ought to grant
      these also; but, if you ask for any thing more improbable than
      your intended conclusion, he ought to refuse it.<a name="FnAnchor9_407" href="#Footnote9_407"><span class="sp">407</span></a>
      Suppose, thirdly, that the thesis is neither probable nor
      improbable. Here, too, the respondent ought to grant all
      concessions that appear to him probable, as well as all that he
      thinks more probable than the opposite conclusion which you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>are
      seeking to arrive at; but no others. This is sufficient for the
      purpose of Dialectic, and for keeping open the lines of probable
      argument.<a name="FnAnchor9_408" href="#Footnote9_408"><span class="sp">408</span></a></p>

    <p> Since all the questions that you ask must be either probable,
      improbable, or neuter, and either relevant<a name="FnAnchor9_411" href="#Footnote9_411"><span class="sp">411</span></a> or not
      relevant to your purpose of refuting the thesis, let us first
      suppose that you ask for a concession which is in itself probable,
      but not relevant. The respondent ought to grant it, adding that he
      thinks it probable. If what you ask is neither probable nor
      relevant, he ought even then to grant it; but annexing a
      notification that he is aware of its improbability, in order to
      save his own credit for intelligence.<a name="FnAnchor9_412" href="#Footnote9_412"><span class="sp">412</span></a> If it be
      both probable and relevant, he ought to say that he is aware of
      its probability, but that it is too closely connected with the
      thesis, and that, if he grants it, the thesis will stand refuted.
      If it be relevant, yet at the same time very improbable, he must
      reply that, if he grants it, the thesis will be refuted, but that
      it is too silly to be propounded. If, being neutral, it is also
      not relevant, he ought to grant it without comment; but if, being
      neutral, it is relevant, he ought to notify that he is aware that
      by granting it his thesis will be refuted.<a name="FnAnchor9_413" href="#Footnote9_413"><span class="sp">413</span></a></p>

    <p> In this way of proceeding, the march of the dialogue on both
      sides will be creditable. The respondent, signifying plainly that
      he understands the full consequences of his own concessions, will
      not appear to be worsted through any short-comings of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>own,

      but only through what is inherent in his thesis; while you the
      questioner, having asked for such premisses as are really more
      probable than the conclusion to be established, and having had
      them granted, will have made out your point. It must be understood
      that you ought not to try to prove your conclusion from premisses
      less probable than itself; and that, if you put questions of this
      sort, you transgress the rules of dialectical procedure.<a name="FnAnchor9_414" href="#Footnote9_414"><span class="sp">414</span></a></p>

    <p> If you ask a dialectical question in plain and univocal
      language, the respondent is bound to answer Yes or No. But if you
      ask it in terms obscure or equivocal, he is not obliged to answer
      thus directly. He is at liberty to tell you that he does not
      understand the question; he ought to have no scruple in telling
      you so, if such is really the fact. Suppose the terms of your
      question to be familiar, but equivocal; the answer to it may
      perhaps be either true or false, alike in all the different senses
      of the terms. In that case, the respondent ought to answer Yes or
      No directly. But, if the answer would be an affirmation in one
      sense of the terms and a negation in another, he must take care to
      signify that he is aware of the equivocation, and to distinguish
      at once the two-fold meaning; for, if the distinction is not
      noticed till afterwards, he cannot clearly show that he was aware
      of it from the first. If he really was not at first aware of the
      equivocation, and gave an affirmative answer looking only to one
      among the several distinct meanings, you will try to convict him
      of error by pushing him on the other meaning. The best thing that
      he can then do will be to confess his oversight, and to excuse
      himself by saying that misconception is easy where the same term
      or the same proposition may mean several different things.<a name="FnAnchor9_415" href="#Footnote9_415"><span class="sp">415</span></a></p>

    <p> Suppose you put several particular questions (or several
      analogous questions) with the view of arriving ultimately by
      induction at the concession of an universal, comprising them all.
      If they are all both true and probable, the respondent must
      concede them all severally; yet he may still intend to answer No,
      when the universal is tendered to him after them. He has no right
      to answer thus, however, unless he can produce some contradictory
      particular instance, real or apparent, to justify him; and, if he
      does so without such justification, he is a perverse <span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>dialectician.<a name="FnAnchor9_416" href="#Footnote9_416"><span class="sp">416</span></a>
      Perhaps he may try to sustain his denegation of the universal,
      after having conceded many particulars, by a counter-attack
      founded on some chain of paradoxical reasoning such as that of
      Zeno against motion; there being many such paradoxes contradictory
      of probabilities, yet hard to refute. But this is no sufficient
      justification for refusing to admit the universal, when, after
      having admitted many particulars, he can produce no particular
      adverse to them. The case will be still worse, if he refuses to
      admit the universal, having neither any adverse instance, nor any
      counter-ratiocinative attack. It is then the extreme of perverse
      Dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor9_417" href="#Footnote9_417"><span class="sp">417</span></a></p>

    <p> Before the respondent undertakes to defend any thesis or
      definition, he ought to have previously studied the various modes
      attacking it, and to have prepared himself for meeting them.<a name="FnAnchor9_418" href="#Footnote9_418"><span class="sp">418</span></a>
      He must also be cautious of taking up improbable theses, in either
      of the senses of improbable. For a thesis is so called when it
      involves strange and paradoxical developments, as if a man lays
      down either that every thing is in motion or that nothing is in
      motion; and also, when it implies a discreditable character and is
      contrary to that which men wish to be thought to hold, as, for
      example, the doctrine that pleasure is the good, or that it is
      better to do wrong than to suffer wrong. If a man defends such
      theses as these, people hate him because they presume that he is
      not merely propounding them as matter for dialectical argument,
      but advocating them as convictions of his own.<a name="FnAnchor9_419" href="#Footnote9_419"><span class="sp">419</span></a></p>

    <p> The respondent must farther be able, if you bring against him a
      false syllogistic reasoning, to distinguish upon which among your
      premisses the false conclusion really turns, and to refute that
      one. Your reasoning may have more than one false premiss; but he
      must not content himself with refuting any one or any other: he
      must single out that one which is the chief determining cause of
      the falsehood. Thus, if your syllogism be:— Every man in a sitting
      position is writing, Sokrates is a man in a sitting position;
      therefore, Sokrates is writing, — it will not suffice that the
      respondent should refute your minor premiss, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>though

      this may be false;<a name="FnAnchor9_420" href="#Footnote9_420"><span class="sp">420</span></a> because such a refutation will not
      apply to the number of other cases in which men are sitting but
      not writing; and therefore it will not expose the full bearing of
      the falsehood. Your major premiss is that upon which the full
      bearing of the falsehood depends; and the respondent must show
      that he is aware of this by refuting your major.<a name="FnAnchor9_421" href="#Footnote9_421"><span class="sp">421</span></a></p>

    <p> This last-mentioned proceeding — refutation of that premiss upon
      which your false conclusion in its full bearing really turns — is
      the only regular, valid, and complete objection whereby the
      respondent can stop out your syllogistic approaches. There are
      indeed three other modes of objection to which he may resort; but
      these are all either inconclusive or unfair. He may turn his
      objection against you personally; and, without refuting any of
      your premisses, he may thus perplex and confuse you, so that you

      may turn his objections against portions of your questions; not
      refuting any one of your premisses, but showing that, as they
      stand, they are insufficient to warrant the conclusion which you
      seek to establish; when, if you are master of your subject, and
      retain your calmness, you will at once supply the deficiency by
      putting additional questions, so that his objection thus vanishes.
      Or, lastly, he may multiply irrelevant objections against time,
      for the purpose of prolonging the discussion and tiring you out.<a name="FnAnchor9_422" href="#Footnote9_422"><span class="sp">422</span></a>
      Of these four modes of objection open to the respondent the first
      is the only one truly valid and conclusive; the three others are
      obstructions either surmountable or unfair, and the last is the
      most discreditable of all.<a name="FnAnchor9_423" href="#Footnote9_423"><span class="sp">423</span></a></p>

    <p> To blame the argumentative procedure and to blame the questioner
      are two distinct things. Perhaps your manner of conducting the
      interrogation, preparatory to your final syllogism, may be open to
      censure; yet nevertheless you the questioner may deserve no
      censure; for it may be the respondent’s fault, not yours. He may
      refuse to grant the very premisses which are essential to the good
      conduct of your case; he may resort to perverse evasions and
      contradictions for the mere purpose of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>thwarting you; so
      that you are forced to adapt yourself to his unworthy manœuvres
      rather than to aim at the thesis itself. Dialectic cannot be well
      conducted unless both the partners do their duty to the common
      purpose; the bad conduct of your respondent puts you out, and the
      dialectic presently degenerates on both sides into angry
      contention.<a name="FnAnchor9_424" href="#Footnote9_424"><span class="sp">424</span></a> Apart from this, too, it must be
      remembered that the express purpose of Dialectic is not to teach,
      but to search and test consequences and to exercise the intellect
      of both parties. Accordingly you are not always restricted to true
      syllogistic premisses and conclusions. You are allowed to resort
      occasionally to false premisses and false conclusions; for, if
      what the respondent advances be true, you have no means of
      refuting it except by falsehood; and, if what he advances be
      false, the best way of refuting it may be through some other
      falsehood.<a name="FnAnchor9_425" href="#Footnote9_425"><span class="sp">425</span></a> You render service to him by doing
      so; for, since his beliefs are contrary to truth, if the dialogue
      is confined to his beliefs, the result may perhaps contribute to
      persuade him, but it will not instruct or profit him.<a name="FnAnchor9_426" href="#Footnote9_426"><span class="sp">426</span></a>
      It is your business to bring him round and emancipate him from
      these erroneous beliefs; but you must accomplish this in a manner
      truly dialectical, and not contentious; whether you proceed by
      true or by false conclusions.<a name="FnAnchor9_427" href="#Footnote9_427"><span class="sp">427</span></a> If you on
      your side, indeed, put questions in a contentious spirit, it is
      you that are to blame. But often the respondent is most to blame,
      when he refuses to grant what he thinks probable, and when he does
      not apprehend what you really intend to ask.<a name="FnAnchor9_428" href="#Footnote9_428"><span class="sp">428</span></a>
      He is sometimes also to blame for granting what he ought to
      refuse; such as <i>Petitio Principii</i> or Affirmation of
      Contraries. It is often difficult to distinguish what questions
      involve <i>Petitio Principii</i> or Affirmation of Contraries:
      they are asked and granted without either party being aware, and
      the like mistake is committed by men in private talk, not merely
      in formal dialogue. When this happens, the argument will
      inevitably be a bad one; but the fault is with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>respondent

      who, having before refused what he ought to have granted, now
      grants what he ought to refuse.<a name="FnAnchor9_429" href="#Footnote9_429"><span class="sp">429</span></a></p>

    <p> Such then are the cases in which the conduct of the dialogue is
      open to censure, without any fault on your part as questioner. But
      there are other cases in which the fault is really yours. These
      are five in number:— (1) When all or most of your questions are so
      framed as to elicit premisses either false or improbable, so that
      neither the conclusion which you seek to obtain, nor any other
      conclusion at all, follows from them; (2) When, from similar
      defects, the proper conclusion that you seek to obtain cannot be
      drawn from your premisses; (3) When the proper conclusion would
      follow, if certain additions were made to your premisses, but such
      additions are of a character worse than the premisses already
      obtained, and are even less probable than the conclusion itself;
      (4) When you have accumulated a superfluous multitude of
      premisses, so that the proper conclusion does not follow from all
      of them but from a part of them only (5) When your premisses are
      more improbable and less trustworthy than the proper conclusion,
      or when, though true, they are harder and more troublesome to
      prove than the problem itself.<a name="FnAnchor9_430" href="#Footnote9_430"><span class="sp">430</span></a></p>

    <p> In regard to the last item, however, the fault may sometimes be
      in the problem itself rather than in you as questioner. Some
      problems, being in their own nature hard and not to be settled
      from probable or plausible data, ought not to be admitted into
      Dialectic. All that can be required from you as questioner is that
      you shall know and obtain the most probable premisses that the
      problem admits: your procedure may be thus in itself blameable,
      yet it may even deserve praise, having regard to the problem, if
      this last be very intractable; or it may be in itself
      praiseworthy, yet blameable in regard to the problem, if the
      problem admit of being settled by premisses still more probable.<a name="FnAnchor9_431" href="#Footnote9_431"><span class="sp">431</span></a>
      You may even be more blameable, if you obtain your conclusion but
      obtain it from improbable premisses, than if you failed to obtain
      it; the premisses required to make it complete being true and
      probable and not of capital importance, but being refused by the
      respondent.<a name="FnAnchor9_432" href="#Footnote9_432"><span class="sp">432</span></a> However, you ought not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>to
      be blamed if you obtain your true and proper conclusion but obtain
      it through premisses in themselves false; for this is recognized
      in analytical theory as possible: if the conclusion is false, the
      premisses (one or both) must be false, but a true conclusion may
      be drawn from false premisses.<a name="FnAnchor9_433" href="#Footnote9_433"><span class="sp">433</span></a></p>

    <p> When you have obtained your premisses and proved a conclusion,
      these same premisses will not serve as proof of any other
      proposition separate and independent of the conclusion; such may
      sometimes seem to be the case, but it is a mere sophistical
      delusion. If your premisses are both of them probable, your
      conclusion may in some cases be more probable than either.<a name="FnAnchor9_434" href="#Footnote9_434"><span class="sp">434</span></a></p>

      <p> Aristotle here introduces four definitions of terms, which are
        useful in regard to his thoughts but have no great pertinence in
        the place where they occur: &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#8050; <span class="gesp">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>

    <p> One other matter yet remains in which your procedure as
      questioner may be blameable. The premisses through which you prove
      your conclusion may be long and unnecessarily multiplied; the
      conclusion may be such that you ought to have obtained it through
      fewer, yet equally pertinent premisses.<a name="FnAnchor9_435" href="#Footnote9_435"><span class="sp">435</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 24-34. </p>
      <p> The example whereby Aristotle illustrates this position is
        obscure and difficult to follow. It is borrowed from the
        Platonic theory of Ideas. The point which you are supposed to be
        anxious to prove is, that one opinion is more opinion than
        another (&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962;). To prove it you ask
        as premisses: (1) That the Idea of every class of things is more
        that thing than any one among the particulars of the class; (2)
        That there is an Idea of <i>matter of opinion</i>, and that
        this Idea is more opinion than any one of the particular matters
        of opinion. If this Idea is more opinion, it must also be more
        true and accurate than any particular matter of opinion. And it
        is this last conclusion that Aristotle seems to indicate as the
        conclusion to be proved: &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8052; &#7969; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957; (a.
        32).</p>
      <p> As I understand it, Aristotle supposes that the doctrine which
        you are here refuting is, that all &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945; are on an equal
        footing as to truth and accuracy; and that the doctrine which
        you are proving against it is, that one &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#957; is more true and
        accurate than another. If you attempt to prove this last by
        invoking the Platonic theory of Ideas, you will introduce
        premisses far-fetched and unnecessary, even if true; whereas you
        might prove your conclusion from premisses easier and more
        obvious.</p>
      <p> The fault is (he says) that such roundabout procedure puts out
        of sight the real ground of the proof: &#964;&#943;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#7969; &#956;&#959;&#967;&#952;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#945;; &#7970; &#8005;&#964;&#953;
        &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;, &#960;&#945;&#961;’ &#8003; &#8001; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;, &#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; (a. 33). The
        dubitative and problematical form here is remarkable. How would
        Aristotle himself have proved the above conclusion? By
        Induction? He does not tell us.</p>
    </div>
    <p> The cases in which your argument will carry the clearest
      evidence, impressing itself even on the most vulgar minds, are
      those in which you obtain such premisses as will enable you to
      draw your final conclusion without asking any farther concessions.
      But this will rarely happen. Even after you have obtained all the
      premisses substantially necessary to your final <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>conclusion,
      you will generally be forced to draw out two or more prosyllogisms
      or preliminary syllogisms, and to ask the assent of the respondent
      to these, before you can venture to enunciate the final
      conclusion. This second grade of evidence is however sufficient,
      even if the premisses fall short of the highest probability.<a name="FnAnchor9_436" href="#Footnote9_436"><span class="sp">436</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> On the other hand, your argument may deserve to be pronounced
      false on four distinct grounds:— (1) If your syllogism appears to
      prove the conclusion but does not really prove it, being then an <i>eristic</i>
      or <i>contentious</i> syllogism; (2) If the conclusion be good
      but not <span class="correction" title="amended from 'revelant'">relevant</span>
      to the thesis, which is most likely to happen where you employ <i>Reductio

        ad Impossible</i>; (3) If your conclusion though valid and even
      relevant, is not founded on the premisses and <i>principia</i>
      appropriate to the thesis; (4) If your premisses are false, even
      though the conclusion in itself may prove true, since it has
      already been said that a true conclusion may sometimes be obtained
      from false premisses.<a name="FnAnchor9_437" href="#Footnote9_437"><span class="sp">437</span></a></p>

    <p> Falsehood in your argument will be rather your own fault than
      that of your argument, especially if you yourself are not aware of
      its falsehood. Indeed, there are some false arguments which are
      more valuable in Dialectic than many true ones; where, for
      example, from highly probable premisses you refute some recognized
      truth. Such an argument is sure to serve as a demonstration of
      other truths; at the very least, it shows that some one of the
      propositions concerned is altogether untrue.<a name="FnAnchor9_438" href="#Footnote9_438"><span class="sp">438</span></a>
      On the other hand, if you prove a true conclusion by premisses
      false and improbable, your argument will be more worthless than
      many others in which the conclusion is false; from such premisses,
      indeed, the conclusion may well be really false.<a name="FnAnchor9_439" href="#Footnote9_439"><span class="sp">439</span></a></p>

    <p> In estimating the dialectical value of an argument, therefore,
      we must first look whether the conclusion is formally valid; next,
      whether the conclusion is true or false; lastly, what are the
      premisses from whence it is derived.<a name="FnAnchor9_440" href="#Footnote9_440"><span class="sp">440</span></a> For, if it

      while, if derived from premisses true yet improbable, it has none.<a name="FnAnchor9_441" href="#Footnote9_441"><span class="sp">441</span></a>

    <p> Two faults of questioners in Dialectic are dealt with specially
      by Aristotle:— (1) <i>Petitio Principii</i>; (2) <i>Petitio
        Contrariorum</i>. He had touched upon both of them (in the
      Analytica Priora) as they concerned the demonstrative process, or
      the proving of truth: he now deals with them as they concern the
      dialectical process, or the setting out of opinions and
      probabilities.<a name="FnAnchor9_442" href="#Footnote9_442"><span class="sp">442</span></a></p>

    <p> Five distinct modes may be enumerated of committing the fault
      called <i>Petitio Principii</i>:— </p>
    <p> 1. You may put as a question the very conclusion which it is
      incumbent on you to prove, in refutation of the thesis of the
      respondent. If this is done in explicit terms, your opponent can
      hardly fail to perceive it; but he possibly may fail, if you
      substitute an equivalent term or the definition in place of the
      term.<a name="FnAnchor9_443" href="#Footnote9_443"><span class="sp">443</span></a></p>

        &#963;&#965;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#8005;&#963;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;,

    </div>
    <p> 2. If the conclusion which you are seeking to prove is a
      particular one, you may put as a question the universal in which
      it is comprised. Thus, if you are to prove that the knowledge of
      Contraries is one and the same, you may put as a question, Is not
      the knowledge of Opposites one and the same? You are asking the
      very point which it was your business to show; but you are asking
      along with it much more besides.<a name="FnAnchor9_444" href="#Footnote9_444"><span class="sp">444</span></a></p>

        Ibid. p. 163, a. 1.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 3. If you are seeking to prove an universal conclusion, <span class="correction" title="amended from 'you you'">you</span> may
      put as a question one of the particulars comprised therein. Thus,
      if you are to prove that the knowledge of Contraries is one and
      the same, you may put as a question, Is not the knowledge of white
      and black, good and evil, or any other pair of particular
      contraries, one and the same? It was your business to prove this
      particular, along with many others besides; but you are now asking
      it as a question separately.<a name="FnAnchor9_445" href="#Footnote9_445"><span class="sp">445</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 5.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 4. If the conclusion which you are seeking to prove has two
      terms conjointly, you may put as a question one or the other of
      these separately. Thus, when you are trying to show that the
      healing art is knowledge of what is wholesome and unwholesome, you
      may ask, Is it a knowledge of the wholesome?<a name="FnAnchor9_446" href="#Footnote9_446"><span class="sp">446</span></a></p>

      Suppose there are two conclusions necessarily implicated with each
      other, and that it is your business to prove one of them: you may
      put as a question the other of the two. Thus, if you are seeking
      to prove that the diagonal is incommensurable with the side, you
      may put as a question, Is not the side incommensurable with the
      diagonal?<a name="FnAnchor9_447" href="#Footnote9_447"><span class="sp">447</span></a></p>

    <p> There are also five distinct modes of <i>Petitio Contrariorum</i>:—

    </p>
    <p> 1. You may ask the respondent, in plain terms, to grant first
      the affirmative, next, the negative, of a given proposition.<a name="FnAnchor9_448" href="#Footnote9_448"><span class="sp">448</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 2. You may ask him to grant, first, that a given subject is, <i>e.g.</i>,
      good, next, that the same subject is bad.<a name="FnAnchor9_449" href="#Footnote9_449"><span class="sp">449</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 3. After he has granted to you the affirmative universally, you
      may ask him to grant the negative in some particular case under
      the universal: <i>e.g.</i>, after he has granted that the
      knowledge of Contraries is one and the same, you ask him to grant
      that the knowledge of wholesome and unwholesome is not one and the
      same. Or you may proceed by the way of reversing this process.<a name="FnAnchor9_450" href="#Footnote9_450"><span class="sp">450</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 17-21.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 4. You may ask the contrary of that which follows necessarily
      from the premisses admitted.<a name="FnAnchor9_451" href="#Footnote9_451"><span class="sp">451</span></a></p>

        Ibid. a. 21.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 5. Instead of asking the two contraries in plain and direct
      terms, you may ask the two contraries in different propositions,
      yet necessarily implicated with the first two.<a name="FnAnchor9_452" href="#Footnote9_452"><span class="sp">452</span></a></p>

    <p> There is this difference between <i>Petitio Principii</i>, and
      <i>Petitio Contrariorum</i>: the first has reference to the
      conclusion which you have to prove, and the wrong procedure
      involved in it is relative to that conclusion; but in the second
      the wrong procedure affects only the two propositions themselves
      and the relation subsisting between them.<a name="FnAnchor9_453" href="#Footnote9_453"><span class="sp">453</span></a></p>

    <p> Aristotle now, finally, proceeds to give some general advice for
      exercise and practice in Dialectic. You ought to accustom yourself
      to treat arguments by converting the syllogisms of which they
      consist; that is, by applying to them the treatment of which the <i>Reductio

        ad Absurdum</i> is one case.<a name="FnAnchor9_454" href="#Footnote9_454"><span class="sp">454</span></a> You ought
      to test every thesis by first assuming it to be true, then
      assuming it to be false, and following out the consequences on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>both

      sides.<a name="FnAnchor9_455" href="#Footnote9_455"><span class="sp">455</span></a> When you have hunted out each train
      of arguments, look out at once for the counter-arguments available
      against it. This will strengthen your power both as questioner and
      as respondent. It is indeed an exercise so valuable, that you will
      do well to go through it by yourself, if you have no companion.<a name="FnAnchor9_456" href="#Footnote9_456"><span class="sp">456</span></a>
      Put the different trains of argument, bearing on the same thesis,
      into comparison with each other. A wide command of arguments
      affirmative as well as negative will serve you well both for
      attack and for defence.<a name="FnAnchor9_457" href="#Footnote9_457"><span class="sp">457</span></a></p>

    <p> This same accomplishment will be of use, moreover, for
      acquisitions even in Science and Philosophy. It is a great step to
      see and grasp in conjunction the trains of reasoning on both sides
      of the question; the task that remains — right determination which
      of the two is the better — becomes much easier. To do this well,
      however, — to choose the true and to reject the false correctly —
      there must be conjoined a good natural predisposition. None but
      those who are well constituted by nature, who have their likings
      and dislikes well set in regard to each particular conjuncture,
      can judge correctly what is best and what is worst.<a name="FnAnchor9_458" href="#Footnote9_458"><span class="sp">458</span></a></p>

    <p> In regard to the primary or most universal theses, and to those
      problems which are most frequently put in debate, you will do well
      to have reasonings ready prepared, and even to get them by heart.
      It is on these first or most universal theses that respondents
      become often reluctant and disgusted. To be expert in handling
      primary doctrines and probabilities, and to be well provided with
      the definitions from which syllogisms must start, is to the
      dialectician an acquisition of the highest moment; like
      familiarity with the Axioms to a geometer, and ready application
      of the multiplication table to an arithmetical calculator.<a name="FnAnchor9_459" href="#Footnote9_459"><span class="sp">459</span></a>
      When you have these generalities and major propositions firmly
      established in your mind, you will recall, in a definite order and
      arrangement, the particular matters falling <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>under each of them,
      and will throw them more easily into syllogisms. They will assist
      you in doing this, just as the mere distribution of places in a
      scheme for topical memory makes you recollect what is associated
      with each. You should lodge in your memory, however, universal
      major premisses rather than complete and ready-made reasonings;
      for the great difficulty is about the <i>principia</i>.<a name="FnAnchor9_460" href="#Footnote9_460"><span class="sp">460</span></a></p>

    <p> You ought also to accustom yourself to break down one reasoning
      into many; which will be done most easily when the theme of the
      reasoning is most universal. Conceal this purpose as well as you
      can; and in this view begin with those particulars which lie most
      remote from the subject in hand.<a name="FnAnchor9_461" href="#Footnote9_461"><span class="sp">461</span></a> In
      recording arguments for your own instruction, you will generalize
      them as much as possible, though perhaps when spoken they may have
      been particular; for this is the best way to break down one into
      several. In conducting your own case as questioner you will avoid
      the higher generalities as much as you can.<a name="FnAnchor9_462" href="#Footnote9_462"><span class="sp">462</span></a> But you
      must at the same time take care to keep up some common or general
      premisses throughout the discourse; for every syllogistic process,
      even where the conclusion is particular, implies this, and no
      syllogism is valid without it.<a name="FnAnchor9_463" href="#Footnote9_463"><span class="sp">463</span></a></p>

    <p> Exercise in inductive discourse is most suitable for a young
      beginner; exercise in deductive or syllogistic discourse, for
      skilful veterans. From those who are accomplished in the former
      you can learn the art of multiplying particular comparisons; from
      those who are accomplished in the latter you derive universal
      premisses; such being the strong points of each. When you go
      through a dialectical exercise, try to bring away with you for
      future use either some complete syllogism, or some solution of an
      apparent refutation, or a major premiss, or a well-sustained
      exceptional example (&#7956;&#957;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;); note also whether either you or
      your respondent question correctly or otherwise, and on what
      reason such correctness or incorrectness turned.<a name="FnAnchor9_464" href="#Footnote9_464"><span class="sp">464</span></a>
      It is the express purpose of dialectical exercise to acquire power
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>and

      facility in this procedure, especially as regards universal
      premisses and special exceptions. Indeed the main characteristic
      of the dialectician is to be apt at universal premisses, and apt
      at special exceptions. In the first of these two aptitudes he
      groups many particulars into one universal, without which he
      cannot make good his syllogism; in the second of the two he breaks
      up the one universal into many, distinguishing the separate
      constituents, and denying some while he affirms others.<a name="FnAnchor9_465" href="#Footnote9_465"><span class="sp">465</span></a></p>

      the dispute cannot fail to take a discreditable turn. When the
      respondent tries to make a show of escaping by unworthy manœuvres,
      the questioner on his part must be unscrupulous also in
      syllogizing; but this is a disgraceful scene. To keep clear of
      such abusive discourse, you must be cautious not to discourse with
      commonplace, unprepared, respondents.<a name="FnAnchor9_466" href="#Footnote9_466"><span class="sp">466</span></a></p>

    <h2><a name="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>
    <h2><span class="smcap">SOPHISTICI ELENCHI.</span></h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The Sophist (according to Aristotle) is one whose professional
      occupation it is to make money by a delusive show of wisdom
      without the reality — by contriving to make others believe falsely
      that he possesses wisdom and knowledge. The abstract substantive
      noun <i>Sophistic</i>, with the verb <i>to practice as a Sophist</i>
      (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;), expresses such profession and purpose.<a name="FnAnchor10_1" href="#Footnote10_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
      This application of the term is derived from Plato, who has in
      various dialogues (Protagoras, Hippias, Euthydêmus, &amp;c.)
      introduced Sokrates conversing with different professional
      Sophists, and who has, in a longer dialogue called Sophistes,
      attempted an elaborate definition of the intellectual
      peculiarities of the person so named. It is the actual
      argumentative procedure of the Sophist that Aristotle proposes to
      himself as the theme of this little treatise, appended to his
      general theory of the Syllogism; a treatise which, though forming
      properly the Ninth and concluding Book of the Topica, is commonly
      known as a separate appendix thereto, under the title of
      Sophistici Elenchi, or Sophistical Refutations.</p>

    <p> The Sophistical Elenchus or Refutation, being a delusive
      semblance of refutation which imposes on ordinary men and induces
      them to accept it as real, cannot be properly understood without
      the theory of Elenchus in general; nor can this last be understood
      without the entire theory of the Syllogism, since the Elenchus is
      only one variety of Syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor10_2" href="#Footnote10_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The Elenchus
      is a syllogism with a conclusion contradictory to or refutative of
      some enunciated thesis or proposition. Accordingly we must first
      understand the conditions of a good and valid Syllogism, before we
      study those of a valid Elenchus; these last, again, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>must
      be understood, before we enter on the distinctive attributes of
      the Pseudo-elenchus — the sophistical, invalid, or sham,
      refutation. In other words, an enumeration and classification of
      Fallacies forms the closing section of a treatise on Logic —
      according to the philosophical arrangement originating with
      Aristotle, and copied by most logicians after him.</p>

    <p> Aristotle begins by distinguishing reality and mere deceptive
      appearance; and by stating that this distinction is found to
      prevail not less in syllogisms than in other matters. Next he
      designates a notorious class of persons, called Sophists, who made
      it their profession to study and practise the deceptive appearance
      of syllogizing; and he then proceeds to distinguish four species
      of debate:— (1) Didactic; (2) Dialectic; (3) Peirastic; (4)
      Eristic or Sophistic.<a name="FnAnchor10_3" href="#Footnote10_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In this quadruple arrangement,
      however, he is not consistent with his own definitions, when he
      ranks the four as distinct and co-ordinate species. The marked and
      special antithesis is between Didactic and Dialectic. Both
      Peirastic and Eristic fall as varieties or sub-species under the
      species Dialectic; and there is under the species Didactic a
      variety called Pseudo-graphic or Pseudo-didactic, which stands to
      Didactic in the same relation in which Eristic stands to
      Dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor10_4" href="#Footnote10_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

    <p> Didactic discourse is not applicable to all matters
      indiscriminately, but only to certain special sciences; each of
      which has its own separate, undemonstrable <i>principia</i>, from
      which its conclusions, so far as true and valid, must be deduced.
      It supposes a teacher acquainted with these <i>principia</i> and
      deductions, talking with some one who being ignorant of them
      wishes to learn. The teacher puts questions, to which the learner
      makes the best answers that he can; and, if the answers are wrong,
      corrects them and proceeds to draw, according to syllogistic
      canons, conclusions from premisses which he himself knows to be
      the truth. These premisses the learner must believe upon the
      teacher’s authority. Properly speaking, indeed, the didactic
      process is not interrogative (in the same sense that Dialectic
      is): the teacher does not accept the learner’s answer and reason
      from it, if he thinks it wrong.<a name="FnAnchor10_5" href="#Footnote10_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

      <p> When Aristotle, therefore, reckons &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#962; as one

        p. 165, a. 38), we must understand &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; in a very wide
        and vague sense, going much beyond the derivative noun

    </div>
    <p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>Dialectic,



      on the contrary, is applicable to all matters universally and
      indiscriminately, including even the undemonstrable <i>principia</i>
      which the teacher assumes as the highest premisses of his didactic
      syllogisms. It supposes, in place of teacher and learner, an
      interrogator (or opponent) and a respondent. The respondent
      declares a problem or thesis, which he undertakes to defend; while
      the other puts questions to him respecting it, with the purpose of
      compelling him either to contradict the thesis, or to contradict
      himself on some other point. The interrogator is allowed only to
      ask questions, and to deduce legitimate conclusions from the
      premisses granted by the respondent in answer: he is not permitted
      to introduce any other premisses. The premisses upon which the
      debate turns are understood all to be probable — opinions
      accredited either among an ordinary multitude or among a few wise
      men, but to have no higher authority. Accordingly there is often a
      conflict of arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, much
      diversified. The process is essentially controversial; and, if the
      questioner does not succeed in exposing a contradiction, the
      respondent is victorious, and remains in possession of the field.</p>
    <p> Such is the capital antithesis, much dwelt upon by Aristotle,
      between Didactic and Dialectic. But that which he calls Peirastic,
      and that which he calls Eristic, are not species co-ordinate with
      and distinguished from Dialectic: they are peculiar aspects,
      subordinate varieties or modes, of Dialectic itself. Aristotle
      himself, indeed, admits Peirastic to be a mode or variety of
      Dialectic;<a name="FnAnchor10_6" href="#Footnote10_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and the like is equally true
      respecting what he terms Eristic or Sophistic.</p>

    <p> These subordinate distinctions turn upon the manner, the
      limitations, and the purpose, for and under which the dialectical
      process is conducted. Dialectic is essentially gymnastic and
      peirastic:<a name="FnAnchor10_7" href="#Footnote10_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> it may be looked at either as
      gymnastic, in reference to the two debaters, or as peirastic, in
      reference to the arguments and doctrines brought forward;
      intellectual exercise and stimulation of the two speakers and the
      auditors around being <span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>effected by testing and confronting
      various probable doctrines. It is the common purpose (&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957;
      &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;)<a name="FnAnchor10_8" href="#Footnote10_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
      of the two champions, to improve and enlarge this exercise for the
      instruction of all, by following out a variety of logical
      consequences and logical repugnancies, bearing more or less
      directly on the thesis which the respondent chooses and undertakes
      to defend against a testing cross-examination. Certain rules and
      limitations are prescribed both for questioner and respondent;
      but, subject to these rules, each of them is bound to exert all
      his acuteness for the purpose of gaining victory; and, though one
      only can gain it, the debate may be well and creditably conducted
      on both sides. If the rules are not observed, if the assailing
      champion, bent upon victory at all cost, has recourse to dishonest
      interrogative tricks, or the defensive champion to perverse and
      obstructive negations, beyond the prescribed boundary, in that
      case the debate is called by Aristotle <i>eristic</i> or <i>contentious</i>,
      from the undue <span class="correction" title="amended from
        'predominence'">predominance</span> of the controversial spirit
      and purpose; also <i>sophistic</i>, from the fact that there
      existed (as he asserts) a class or profession of persons called
      Sophists, who regularly studied and practised these culpable
      manœuvres, first with a view to reputation, and ultimately with a
      view to pecuniary profit, being pretenders to knowledge and wisdom
      without any reality to justify them.<a name="FnAnchor10_9" href="#Footnote10_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

    <p> We thus see plainly that Peirastic and Eristic are not to be
      ranked as two distinct species of discourse, co-ordinate with
      Didactic and Dialectic; but that <i>peirastic</i> is in fact an
      epithet applicable generally to Dialectic, bringing to view one of
      its useful and appropriate functions; while <i>eristic</i>
      designates only a peculiar mode of conducting the process, the
      essential feature of which is that it is abusive or that it
      transgresses the rules and regulations. Still less ought Sophistic
      to be ranked as a distinct species; since it involves no intrinsic
      or intellectual <i>differentia</i>, but connotes only ethical and
      personal peculiarities ascribed to the Sophist, who is treated as
      an impostor practising dishonest tricks for the sake of pecuniary
      profit.<a name="FnAnchor10_10" href="#Footnote10_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

        Sophist by his &#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; from the Dialectician, but recognizing
        that in point of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; both are alike. Mr. Poste observes
        justly (in Transl. of the Soph. El., notes, p. 99):— “&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;,
        capacity, is in the intellect; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, purpose, in the will.
        The antithesis between these terms may throw light on what
        Aristotle conceived to be the relation between Sophistic and
        Dialectic.… The power <i>plus</i> the will to deceive is called
        Sophistic; the power without the will, Dialectic (p. 100).”</p>
    </div>
    <p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>While,



      however, we recognize as main logical distinctions only the two
      heads Didactic and Dialectic, we note another way that Aristotle
      has of bringing in what he calls Sophistic as a variety of the
      latter. Both in Didactic and Dialectic (he tells us) the speakers
      enunciate and prove their propositions by Syllogism; the didactic
      syllogism is derived from the <i>principia</i> belonging
      specially to one particular science, and proceeds from premisses
      that are true to conclusions that are true; while the dialectic
      syllogism starts from probable premisses (<i>i.e.</i>, accredited
      by the ordinary public or by a few wise men), and marches in
      correct form to conclusions that are probable. Now, corresponding
      to each of these two, Aristotle recognizes farther a sort of
      degenerate counterpart. To the didactic syllogism there
      corresponds the <i>pseudographic</i> syllogism or the <i>paralogism</i>:
      which draws its premisses (as the didactic syllogism does) from
      the special matters of some given science,<a name="FnAnchor10_11" href="#Footnote10_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> yet which
      nevertheless has only the appearance of truth without the reality;
      either because it is incorrect in syllogistic form, or because the
      matter of the premisses (the major, the minor, or both) is untrue.
      To the dialectic syllogism in like manner, there corresponds the <i>eristic</i>
      or <i>sophistic</i> syllogism: which is a good syllogism in
      appearance, but not in reality; either because it is incorrect in
      form, or because its premisses, in respect of their matter, appear
      to be probable without being really probable.<a name="FnAnchor10_12" href="#Footnote10_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

    <p> One would suppose that the relation between the pseudo-didactic
      and the didactic syllogism, was the same as that between the
      pseudo-dialectic and the dialectic; so that, if the
      pseudo-dialectic deserved to be called sophistic or eristic, the
      pseudo-didactic would deserve these appellations also; especially,
      since the formal conditions of the syllogism are alike for both.
      This Aristotle does not admit, but draws instead a remarkable
      distinction. The Sophist (he says) is a dishonest man, making it
      his professional purpose to deceive; the pseudo-graphic man of
      science is honest always, though sometimes mistaken. So long as
      the pseudo-graphic syllogism keeps within the limits belonging to
      its own special science, it may be false, since the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>geometer



      may be deceived even in his own science geometry,<a name="FnAnchor10_13" href="#Footnote10_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
      but it cannot be sophistic or eristic; yet, whenever it
      transgresses those limits, even though it be true and though it
      solves the problem proposed, it deserves to be called by those two
      epithets. Thus, there were two distinct methods proposed for the
      quadrature of the circle — one by Hippokrates, on geometrical
      principles, the other by Bryson, upon principles
      extra-geometrical. Both demonstrations were false and
      unsuccessful; yet that of Hippokrates was not sophistic or
      eristic, because he kept within the sphere of geometry; while that
      of Bryson was so, because it travelled out of geometry. Nay more,
      this last would have been equally sophistic and eristic, and on
      the same ground, even if it had succeeded in solving the problem.<a name="FnAnchor10_14" href="#Footnote10_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
      If indeed the pseudo-graphic syllogism be invalid in form, it must
      be considered as sophistic, even though within the proper
      scientific limits as to matter; but, if it be correct in form and
      within these same limits, then, however untrue its premisses may
      be, it is to be regarded as not sophistic or eristic.<a name="FnAnchor10_15" href="#Footnote10_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

    <p> Such is the test whereby Aristotle distinguishes the
      sophistication of the didactic process from the legitimate working
      of that process. Now this same test cannot be applied to
      Dialectic, which has no appropriate or exclusive specialty of
      matters, but deals with <i>Omne Scibile</i>, universally and
      indiscriminately. Aristotle therefore puts the analogy in another
      way. Both in Didactic and in Dialectic the Sophist is one who sins
      against the fundamental conditions of the task which he
      undertakes; these conditions being, that in Didactic he shall
      confine himself to the matters and premisses of a given science, —
      in Dialectic, to matters probable of whatever kind they may be.
      Transgression of these conditions constitutes unfair and dishonest
      manœuvre, whether of teacher or questioner; like breach of the
      regulations on the part of competitors, bent on victory at all
      price, in the Olympic games. Aristotle ranks this dishonesty as a
      species, under the name of Sophistic or Eristic, admitting of
      being analysed and defined;<a name="FnAnchor10_16" href="#Footnote10_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> and his

    <p> Fallacious dialectical refutation being thus referred altogether
      to dishonesty of purpose (either contentious or profit-seeking)
      and being assumed as unknown in fair dialectical debate, we have
      to see by what characteristic Aristotle discriminates fallacious
      premisses from fair and admissible premisses. Dialectic (he tells
      us) has for its appropriate matter probable premisses — beliefs
      accredited either by the multitude or by a wise few. But (he goes
      on to say) not everything which appears probable is really
      probable. Nothing that is really probable is a mere superficial
      fancy; wherever this last is the case, the <i>probabilia</i> are
      apparent only and not real; they have the character of falsehood
      stamped upon them, so as to be immediately manifest and obvious,
      even to persons of very narrow intelligence. It is such apparent <i>probabilia</i>
      as these, which make up the premisses of eristic or sophistic
      discourse, and upon which the sophistical or fallacious
      refutations turn.<a name="FnAnchor10_18" href="#Footnote10_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>

    <p> Aristotle thus draws a broad and marked line between Dialectic
      on the one hand, and Eristic or Sophistic on the other; and he
      treats the whole important doctrine of Logical Fallacies as coming
      under this latter department. The distinction that he draws
      between them is two-fold: first as to purpose, next as to
      subject-matter. On the part of the litigious or sophistical
      debater there is the illicit purpose of victory at all cost, or
      for profit; and probabilities merely apparent — such as any one
      may see not to be real probabilities — constitute the matter of
      his syllogisms.</p>
    <p> Now, as to the distinction of purpose, we may put aside the idea
      of profit as having no essential connection with the question. It
      is quite possible to suppose the fair Dialectician, not less than
      the Sophist, as exhibiting his skill for pecuniary reward; while
      the eagerness for victory on both sides is absolutely
      indispensable even in well-conducted debate, in order that the
      appropriate stimulus and benefit of dialectical exercise may be
      realized. But, if the distinction of purpose and procedure,
      between the Dialectician and the Sophist, is thus undefined and
      unsatisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span> still more unsatisfactory is the
      distinction of subject-matter. To discriminate between what is
      really probable (<i>i.e.</i>, accredited either by the multitude
      or by a wise few), and what is only probable in appearance and not
      in reality — is a task of extreme difficulty. The explanation
      given by Aristotle himself<a name="FnAnchor10_19" href="#Footnote10_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> — when he
      describes the apparently probable as that which has only
      superficial show, and which the most ordinary intelligence
      discerns at once to be false — includes only the more gross and
      obvious fallacies, but leaves out all the rest. Nothing can be
      more incorrect than the assumption, in regard to fallacies
      generally, that the appearance of probability is too faint to
      impose upon any ordinary man. If all fallacies could be supposed
      to come under this definition, the theory of Fallacies would
      undoubtedly be worthless (as Mr. Poste suggests that it is, in the
      Preface to his translation of the Sophistici Elenchi); and the
      most dishonest Sophist would at any rate be harmless. But, in
      fact, Aristotle himself departs from this definition even in the
      beginning of the Sophistici Elenchi; for he there treats the
      sophistic syllogism and refutation as having a semblance of
      validity plausible enough to impose upon many persons, and to be
      difficult of detection; like base metals having the exterior
      appearance of gold and silver, and like men got up for the purpose
      of looking finer and stronger than they really are.<a name="FnAnchor10_20" href="#Footnote10_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
      Here we have the eristic or sophistic syllogism presented as
      fallacious, yet as very likely to be mistaken for truth, by
      unprepared auditors, unless warning and precaution be applied; not
      (as it was set forth in the definition above cited) as bearing the
      plain and obvious stamp of falsehood, recognizable even by the
      vulgar. At the time when Aristotle constructed that definition, he
      probably had present to his mind such caricatures of dialectical
      questions as Plato (in the dialogue Euthydêmus) puts into the
      mouth of the Sophists Euthydêmus and Dionysodorus. And, since
      Aristotle chose to connect fallacious reasoning with dishonest
      purposes, and to announce it as employed exclusively by dishonest
      debaters, he seems to have found satisfaction in describing it as
      something which no honest man of ordinary understanding could
      accept as true: the Sophist being thus presented not merely as a
      knave but as a fool.</p>

    <p> I think it a mistake on the part of Aristotle to treat the

      themselves, assuming dialectical debate to be conducted entirely
      with a view to its legitimate purposes of testing a thesis and
      following out argumentative consequences. It is true that, if
      there are infirmities incident to the human intellect, a dishonest
      disputant will be likely to take advantage of them. So far it may
      be well to note his presence. But the dishonest disputant does not
      originate these infirmities: he finds them already existing, and
      manifested undesignedly not merely in dialectical debate, but even
      in ordinary discourse. It is the business of those who theorize on
      the intellectual processes to specify and discriminate the
      Fallacies as liabilities to intellectual error among mankind in
      general, honest or dishonest, with a view to precaution against
      their occurrence, or correction if they do occur; not to present
      them as inventions of a class of professional cheats,<a name="FnAnchor10_21" href="#Footnote10_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
      or as tares sown by the enemy in a field where the natural growth
      would be nothing but pure wheat.</p>

    <p> In point of fact the actual classification of Fallacies given by
      Aristotle is far sounder than his announcement would lead us to
      expect. Though he entitles them Sophistical Refutations,
      describing them as intentionally cultivated and exclusively
      practised by professional Sophists for gain, or by unprincipled
      litigants for victory, yet he recognises them as often very
      difficult of detection, and as an essential portion of the theory
      of Dialectic generally.<a name="FnAnchor10_22" href="#Footnote10_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> The various
      general heads under which he distributes them are each
      characterized by intellectual or logical marks.</p>

    <p> His first and most general observation is, that language is the
      usual medium and instrument through which fallacies are operated.<a name="FnAnchor10_23" href="#Footnote10_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
      Names and propositions are of necessity limited in number; but
      things named or nameable are innumerable; hence it happens
      inevitably that the same name or the same proposition must have
      several different meanings. Since we cannot talk of things except
      by means of their names, the equivocation inseparable from these
      names is a constant source of false conclusions.<a name="FnAnchor10_24" href="#Footnote10_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> In dialectical procedure, the Sophist and the litigious debater
      aim at the accomplishment of five distinguishable ends:— (1) To
      refute, or obtain the false appearance of refuting, the thesis;
      (2) To catch, or appear to catch, the opponent in affirming <span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>something false or contradictory; (3) Or in affirming something paradoxical;
      (4) Or in uttering incorrect and ungrammatical speech; (5) Or in
      tautological repetition. The first of these five ends is what the
      Sophist most desires; where that cannot be had, then, as secondary
      purposes, the succeeding four, in the order in which they are
      enumerated.<a name="FnAnchor10_25" href="#Footnote10_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> The syllogism whereby the Sophist appears to refute without
      really refuting, is either faulty in form, or untrue in matter, or
      irrelevant to the purpose. The Fallacies that he employs to bring
      about this deceitful appearance of refutation are various, and may
      be distributed first under two great divisions:— </p>
    <p class="list">I. <i>Fallaciæ Dictionis</i>.</p>
    <p class="list">II. <i>Fallaciæ Extra Dictionem</i>.</p>
    <p> I. The first division — <i>Fallaciæ Dictionis</i> — includes
      all those cases wherein, under the same terms or propositions,
      more than one meaning is expressed. Six heads may be
      distinguished:— </p>
    <p class="list"> 1. Homonymy (Equivocation): where the double
      meaning resides in one single term — noun or verb.</p>
    <p class="list"> 2. Amphiboly: where the double meaning resides, not
      in a single word but, in a combination of words — proposition,
      phrase, or sentence.</p>
    <p class="list"> 3. Conjunction (hardly distinguishable from that
      immediately preceding — Amphiboly).</p>
    <p class="list"> 4. Disjunction: where what is affirmed
      conjunctively is not true disjunctively, or the reverse. (<i>E.g.</i>,
      Five are two and three; but you cannot say, Five are even and odd.
      The greater is equal and something besides; but you cannot say,
      The greater is equal.)</p>
    <p class="list"> 5. Accentuation: where the same word differently
      accentuated has a different meaning.</p>
    <p class="list"> 6. <i>Figura Dictionis</i>: where two words, from
      being analogous in form, structure, or conjugation, are
      erroneously supposed to be analogous in meaning also.<a name="FnAnchor10_26" href="#Footnote10_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a></p>

        Ibid. iv. p. 165, b. 23-p. 166, b. 19.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Such are the six heads of <i>Fallaciæ Dictionis</i> — Fallacies
      or Paralogisms arising from words as such, or something directly
      appertaining to them.</p>
    <p> II. Under the second division — Fallacies or Paralogisms <i>Extra



        Dictionem</i> — there are seven heads:</p>
    <p class="list"> 1. <i>Fallacia Accidentis</i>.</p>
    <p class="list">2. <i>Fallacia a dicto Secundum Quid ad dictum
        Simpliciter</i>.</p>
    <p class="list"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>3.



      <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>.</p>
    <p class="list">4. <i>Fallacia Consequentis</i></p>
    <p class="list">5. <i>Petitio Principii</i>.</p>
    <p class="list">6. <i>Non Causa pro Causâ</i>.</p>
    <p class="list">7. <i>Fallacia Plurium Interrogationum</i>.<a name="FnAnchor10_27" href="#Footnote10_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

        Soph. El. v. p. 166, b. 20-27.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 1. The first of these varieties, called <i>Fallacia Accidentis</i>,
      arises when a syllogism is made to conclude that, because a given
      predicate may be truly affirmed of a given subject, the same
      predicate may also be truly affirmed respecting all the accidents
      of that subject: as when Koriskus is denied to be a man, because
      he is not Sokrates, who is a man; or is denied to be Koriskus,
      because he is a man, while a man is not Koriskus.</p>
    <p> In the title given to this general head of Fallacy,<a name="FnAnchor10_28" href="#Footnote10_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>
      we must understand Accident, not in its special logical sense as
      opposed to Essence, but in a far larger sense, including both
      Genus when predicated separately from Differentia, and Differentia
      when predicated separately from Genus; including, in fact, every
      thing which is distinguishable from the subject in any way, and at
      the same time predicable of it — every thing except the
      Definition, which conjoins Genus and Differentia together, and is
      thus identical and convertible with the <i>definitum</i>.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote10_28" id="Footnote10_28"></a><a href="#FnAnchor10_28">28</a></span>
        Ibid. b. 29: &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#943;. Every man is an
        animal; but, because a predicate is true of the subject man, you
        cannot infer that the same predicate is true of the subject
        animal. This title comprehends within its range another, which
        is presently announced as distinct and separate — <i>Fallacia
          Consequentis</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 2. The second general variety arises when a proposition is
      affirmed with qualification or limitation in the premisses, but is
      affirmed without qualification, simply and absolutely, in the
      conclusion. The Ethiopian is white in his teeth and black in his
      skin; therefore, he is both white and not white — both white and
      black. In this example the fallacy is obvious, and can hardly
      escape any one; but there are many other cases in which the
      distinction is not so conspicuous, and in which the respondent
      will hesitate whether he ought to grant or refuse a question
      simply and absolutely.<a name="FnAnchor10_29" href="#Footnote10_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> One example
      given by Aristotle deserves notice on its own account: <i>Non-Ens
        est opinabile</i>, therefore <i>Non-Ens est</i>; or, again, <i>Ens



        non est homo</i>, therefore, <i>Ens non est</i>. This is one
      among Aristotle’s ways of bringing to view what modern logicians
      describe as the double function of the substantive verb — to serve
      as copula in predication, and to predicate existence.<a name="FnAnchor10_30" href="#Footnote10_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
      He regards the confusion between these two <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>functions as an
      example of the Fallacy now before us — of passing <i>a dicto

        The same double or multiple meaning of <i>Est</i> is
        discriminated by Aristotle in the Metaphysica, but in a
        different way — &#964;&#8056; &#8002;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962; — <span class="smcap">&#916;.</span> vii. p. 1017, a. 31; <span class="smcap">E.</span> iv. p. 1027, b. 18-36. Bonitz (ad.
        Metaphys. <span class="smcap">Z.</span> iv. p. 310) says:—
        “Quid quod etiam illud <i>esse</i> huc refert, quo non
        existentiam significamus, sed predicati cum subjecto
        conjunctionem.” Aristotle is even more precise than modern
        logicians in analysing the different meanings of &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;: he
        distinguishes <i>four</i> of them.</p>

      <p> It is clear from the above passages that Aristotle was
        thoroughly aware of the logical fact which Hobbes, James Mill,
        and Mr. John Stuart Mill, have more fully brought out and
        illustrated, as the confusion between the two distinct functions
        of the substantive verb. Many excellent remarks on the subject
        will be found in the ‘System of Logic,’ by Mr. J. S. Mill (Bk.
        I. ch. iv. s. 1); also in the ‘Analysis of the Human Mind,’ by
        James Mill, especially in the recent edition of that work,
        containing the explanatory notes by Mr. J. S. Mill and Dr.
        Findlater (Vol. I. ch. iv. p. 174, seq.). Mr. J. S. Mill,
        however, speaks too unreservedly of this confusion as having
        escaped the notice of Aristotle, and as having been brought to
        light only by or since Hobbes. He says (in a note on the
        ‘Analysis,’ p. 183):— “As in the case of many other luminous
        thoughts, an approach is found to have been made to it by
        previous thinkers. Hobbes, though he did not reach it, came very
        close to it; and it was still more distinctly anticipated by
        Laromiguière, though without any sufficient perception of its
        value … in the following words:— ‘Quand on dit, l’être est,
        &amp;c., le mot <i>est</i>, ou le verbe, n’exprime pas la même
        chose que le mot <i>être</i>, sujet de la définition. Si
        j’énonce la proposition suivante: Dieu est existant, je ne
        voudrais pas dire assurément, Dieu existe existant: cela ne
        ferait pas un sens: de même, si je dis que Virgile est poète, je
        ne veux pas donner à entendre que Virgile existe. Le verbe <i>est</i>
        dans la proposition n’exprime dont pas l’existence réelle; il
        n’exprime qu’un rapport spécial entre le sujet et l’attribut,
        &amp;c.’” The passages above cited from Aristotle show that he
        had not only enunciated the same truth as Laromiguière, but even
        illustrated it by the same example (Homer instead of Virgil). I
        shall in another place state more fully the views of Aristotle
        respecting <i>Existence</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 3. The third of these heads of Fallacy — <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>
      — is, when the speaker, professing to contradict the thesis,
      advances another proposition which contradicts it in appearance
      only but not in reality, because he does not know what are the
      true and sufficient conditions of a valid Elenchus. In order to be
      valid, it must be real, not merely verbal; it must be proved by
      good syllogistic premisses, without any <i>Petitio Principii</i>;
      and it must deny the same matter, in the same relations, and at
      the same time, as that which the thesis affirmed. Thus, it is no
      contradiction to affirm and deny doubleness of the same body; both
      affirmation and denial may be true, if you take the comparison
      against different numbers or different bodies, or at different
      times. Sometimes persons neglect some of these conditions, and
      fancy that they have contradicted the thesis, when they have not:
      this is <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>.<a name="FnAnchor10_32" href="#Footnote10_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> (If the
      thesis be an affirmative <span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>universal, it <i>is</i> sufficient

        Soph. El. v. p. 167, a. 21-35: &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#948;&#953;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#943;

      <p> We may remark, by the way, that it is not very consistent in
        Aristotle to recognize one general head of Sophistical
        Refutation called <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>, after the
        definition that he has given of the Sophist at the beginning of
        this treatise. He had told us that the Sophist was a dishonest
        man, who made it his profession to study and practise these
        tricks, for the purpose of making himself pass for a clever man,
        and of getting money. According to this definition, there is no
        <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i> in the Sophist, though there may be in
        the person who supposes himself refuted. The Sophist is assumed
        to know what he is about, and to be aware that his argument is a
        fallacious one.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 4. The fourth head includes what are called <i>Fallaciæ
        Consequentis</i>: when a man inverts the relation between
      predicate and subject in a categorical proposition affirmative and
      universal, thinking that it may be simply converted or that the
      subject may be truly affirmed of the predicate; or when, in an
      hypothetical proposition, he inverts the relation between
      antecedent and consequent, arguing that, because the consequent is
      true, the antecedent must for that reason be true also. Honey is
      of yellow colour; you see a yellow substance, and you infer for
      that reason that it must be honey. Thieves generally walk out by
      night; you find a man walking out by night, and you infer that he
      must be a thief. These are inferences from Signs, opinions founded
      on facts of sense, such as are usually employed in Rhetoric; often
      or usually true, but not necessarily or universally true, and
      therefore fallacious when used as premisses in a syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor10_33" href="#Footnote10_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>

        Soph. El. v. p. 167, b. 1-18. This head (<i>Fallacia
          Consequentis</i>) is not essentially distinguishable from the
        first (<i>Fallacia Accidentis</i>), being nothing more than a
        peculiar species or variety thereof, as Aristotle himself admits
        a little farther on — vi. p. 168, a. 26; vii. p. 169, b. 7;
        viii. p. 170, a. 3. Compare also xxviii. p. 181, a. 25.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 5. The fifth head is that of <i>Petitio Principii</i>: a man
      sometimes assumes for his premiss what is identical with the
      conclusion to be proved, without being aware of the identity.<a name="FnAnchor10_34" href="#Footnote10_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> 6. The sixth head of Fallacy — <i>Non Causa pro Causâ</i> — is,
      when we mistake for a cause that which is not really a cause; or,
      to drop the misleading word <i>cause</i>, and to adopt the
      clearer terms in which this same fallacy is announced in the
      Analytica Priora<a name="FnAnchor10_35" href="#Footnote10_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> — <i>Non per Hoc</i> — <i>Non
        propter Hoc</i>, it arises when we put forward, as an essential
      premiss of a given conclusion, something that is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>not
      really an essential premiss thereof. When you intend to refute a
      given thesis by showing, that, if admitted, it leads to impossible
      or absurd conclusions, you must enunciate that thesis itself among
      the premisses that lead to such absurdities.<a name="FnAnchor10_36" href="#Footnote10_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
      But, though enunciated in this place, it may often happen that the
      thesis may be an unnecessary adjunct — not among the premisses
      really pertinent and essential: and that the impossible conclusion
      may be sufficiently proved, even though the thesis were omitted.
      Still, since the thesis is declared along with the rest, it will
      appear falsely to be a part of the real proof. It will often
      appear so even to yourself the questioner; you not detecting the
      fallacy.<a name="FnAnchor10_37" href="#Footnote10_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Under such circumstances the
      respondent meets you by <i>Non propter Hoc</i>. He admits your
      conclusion to be impossible, and at the same time to be duly
      proved, but he shows you that it is proved by evidence independent
      of his thesis, and not by reason or means of his thesis.
      Accordingly you have advanced a syllogism good in itself, but not
      good for the purpose which you aimed at;<a name="FnAnchor10_38" href="#Footnote10_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> viz., to
      refute the thesis by establishing that it led to impossible
      consequences. You will fail, even if the impossible consequence
      which you advance is a proposition conjoined with the thesis
      through a continuous series of intermediate propositions, each of
      them having one common term with the next. Much more will you
      fail, if your impossible consequence is quite foreign and
      unconnected with the thesis; as we sometimes find in Dialectic.</p>

        xvii. p. 65.</p>
      <p> In commenting on the above chapter of the Analytica Priora, I
        have already remarked (Vol. I. p. 258, <a href="#Footnote6_29">note</a>) how much
        better is the designation there given of the present fallacy — <i>Non



          per Hoc</i> (&#959;&#8016; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#952;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;) — than the
        designation here given of the same fallacy — <i>Non Causa pro
          Causâ</i>. Aristotle is speaking of a syllogistic process,
        consisting of premisses and a conclusion; the premisses being
        the <i>reasons</i> or grounds of the conclusion, not the <i>cause</i>
        thereof, as that term is commonly understood. The term <i>cause</i>
        is one used in so many different senses that we cannot be too
        careful in reasoning upon it. See Whately’s remarks on this
        subject, Bk. iii. Sect. 14, of his Logic: also his Appendix I.

    <p> 7. The seventh and last of these heads of Fallacy is, when the
      questioner puts two distinct questions in the same form of words,
      as if they were one — <i>Fallacia Plurium Interrogationum ut
        Unius</i>. In well-conducted Dialectic the respondent was
      assumed to reply either Yes or No to the question put; or, if it
      was put in the form of an alternative, he accepted distinctly one
      term of the alternative. Under such conditions he could not reply
      to one of these double-termed questions without speaking falsely
      or committing himself. Are the earth and the sea liquid? Is the
      heaven or the earth sea? The questions are improperly put, and
      neither admits of any one correct answer. You ought to confine
      yourself to one question at a time, with one subject and one
      predicate, making what is properly understood by one single
      proposition. The two questions here stated as examples ought
      properly to be put as four.<a name="FnAnchor10_39" href="#Footnote10_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a></p>

      <p> The examples given of this fallacy by Aristotle are so
        palpable — the expounder of every fallacy <i>must</i> make it
        clear by giving examples that every one sees through at once —
        that we are tempted to imagine that no one can be imposed on by
        it. But Aristotle himself remarks, very justly, that there occur
        many cases in which we do not readily see whether one question
        only, or more than one, is involved; and in which one answer is
        made, though two questions are concerned. To set out distinctly
        all the separate debateable points is one of the most essential
        precautions for ensuring correct decision. The importance of
        such discriminating separation is one of the four rules
        prescribed by Descartes in his Discours de la Méthode. The
        present case comes under Mr. Mill’s Fallacies of Confusion.</p>
    </div>
    <p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>Aristotle



      has thus distinguished and classified Fallacies under thirteen
      distinct heads in all — six <i>In Dictione</i>, and seven <i>Extra



        Dictionem</i>; among which last one is <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>.
      He now proceeds to show that, in another way of looking at the
      matter, all the Fallacies ranged under the thirteen heads, may be
      shown to be reducible to this single one — <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>.
      Every Fallacy, whatever it be, transgresses or fails to satisfy,
      in some way or other, the canons or conditions which go to
      constitute a valid Elenchus,<a name="FnAnchor10_40" href="#Footnote10_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> or a valid
      Syllogism. For a true Elenchus is only one mode of a true
      Syllogism; namely, that of which the conclusion is contradictory
      to some given thesis or proposition.<a name="FnAnchor10_41" href="#Footnote10_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> With this
      particular added, the definition of a valid Syllogism will also be
      the definition of a good Elenchus. And thus <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>
      — misconception or neglect of the conditions of a good Elenchus —
      understood in its largest meaning, is rather a characteristic
      common to all varieties of Fallacy, than one variety among others.<a name="FnAnchor10_42" href="#Footnote10_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

    <p> In regard to two among the thirteen heads — <i>Fallacia
        Accidentis</i> and <i>Fallacia Consequentis</i> (which however
      ought properly to rank as only one head, since the second is
      merely a particular variety of the first) — Aristotle’s
      observations are remarkable. After having pointed out that a
      Syllogism embodying this fallacy will not be valid or conclusive
      (thus showing that it involves <i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>), he
      affirms that even scientific men were often not aware of it, and
      conceived themselves to be really refuted by an unscientific
      opponent urging against them such an inconclusive syllogism. To
      take an example:— Every triangle has its three angles equal to two
      right angles; every triangle is a figure; therefore, every figure
      has its three angles equal to two right angles.<a name="FnAnchor10_43" href="#Footnote10_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
      Here we have an invalid syllogism; for it is in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>the
      Third figure, and sins against the conditions of that figure, by
      exhibiting an universal affirmative conclusion: it is a syllogism
      properly concluding in <i>Darapti</i>, but with conclusion
      improperly generalized. Yet Aristotle intimates that a scientific
      geometer of his day, in argument with an unscientific opponent,
      would admit the conclusion to be well proved, not knowing how to
      point out where the fallacy lay: he would, if asked, grant the
      premisses necessary for constructing such a syllogism; and, even
      if not asked, would suppose that he had already granted them, or
      that they ought to be granted.<a name="FnAnchor10_44" href="#Footnote10_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

      <p> Here we have Figure reckoned as an <i>accident</i> of
        Triangle. This is a specimen of Aristotle’s occasional laxity in
        employing the word &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;. He commonly uses it as contrasted
        with <i>essential</i>, of which last term Mr. Poste says very
        justly (notes, p. 129):— “To complete the statement of
        Aristotle’s view, it should be added, that essential
        propositions are those whose predicate cannot be defined without
        naming the subject, or whose subject cannot be defined without
        naming the predicate.” Now figure is the genus to which triangle
        belongs, and triangle cannot be defined without naming its genus
        figure. But to include Genus as a predicable under the head of
        &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; or Accident, is in marked opposition to Aristotle’s
        own doctrine elsewhere: see Topic. I. v. p. 102, b. 4; iv. p.
        101, b. 17; Analyt. Post. I. ii. p. 71, b. 9; Metaphys. <span class="smcap">E.</span> p. 1026, b. 32. It is a misfortune
        that Aristotle gave to this general head of Fallacy the
        misleading title of <i>Fallacia Accidentia</i> — &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8056;
        &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;. When he gave this title, he probably had present to
        his mind only such examples as he indicates in Soph. El. v. p.
        166, b. 32. Throughout the Topica and elsewhere, Genus is
        distinguished pointedly from &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;, though examples occur
        occasionally in which the distinction is neglected. The two
        Fallacies called <i>Accidentis</i> and <i>Consequentis</i>,
        would both be more properly ranked under one common logical
        title — <i>Supposed convertibility or interchangeableness
          between Subject and Predicate</i> — &#949;&#7984; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#948;&#949; &#956;&#8052;

    <p> The passage affords us a curious insight into the intellectual
      grasp of the scientific men contemporary with Aristotle. Most of
      them were prepared to admit fallacious inferences (such as the
      above) which assumed the interchangeability of subject and
      predicate. They had paid little or no attention to the logical
      relations between one proposition and another, and between the two
      different terms of the same proposition. The differences of
      essential from accidental predication, and of each among the five
      Predicables from the others, must have been practically familiar
      to them, as to others, from the habit of correct speaking in
      detail; but they had not been called upon to consider correct
      speaking and reasoning in theory, nor to understand upon what
      conditions it depended whether the march of their argumentative
      discourse landed them in true or false results. And, if even the
      scientific men were thus unaware of logical fallacies, we may be
      sure that this must have been still more the case with
      unscientific men, of ordinary intelligence and education.
      Aristotle tells us here, in more than one passage, how widespread
      such <span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>illogical



      tendencies were: to fancy that two subjects which had one
      predicate the same must be the same with each other in all
      respects;<a name="FnAnchor10_45" href="#Footnote10_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> to understand each predicate applied
      to a subject as being itself an independent subject, implying a
      new <i>Hoc Aliquid</i> or <i>Unum</i>;<a name="FnAnchor10_46" href="#Footnote10_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> to treat
      the universal, not as a common epithet but, as a substantive and
      singular apart;<a name="FnAnchor10_47" href="#Footnote10_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> to use equivocal words or phrases,
      even the most wide and vague, without any attempt to discriminate
      their various meanings.<a name="FnAnchor10_48" href="#Footnote10_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> Such
      insensibility to the conditions of accurate reasoning prevailed
      alike among ordinary men and among the men of special science. A
      geometer would be imposed upon by the inconclusive syllogism
      stated in the last paragraph, which, as being founded on the <i>Fallacia



        Accidentia</i> (or interchangeability of subject and predicate),
      Aristotle numbers among Sophistical Refutations. Such a
      refutation, however, even when successful, would not at all prove
      that the geometer was deficient in knowledge of his own science;<a name="FnAnchor10_49" href="#Footnote10_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
      for it would puzzle the really scientific man as well as the
      pretender.</p>

    <p> We must always recollect that Aristotle was the first author who
      studied the logical relations between Terms and Propositions, with
      a view to theory and to general rules founded thereupon. The
      distinctions which he brought to view were in his time novelties;
      even the simplest rules, such as those relating to the Conversion
      of propositions, or to Contraries and Contradictories, had never
      been stated in general terms before. Up to a certain point,
      indeed, acquired habit, even without these generalities, would
      doubtless lead to correct speech and reasoning; yet liable to be
      perverted in many cases by erroneous tendencies, requiring to be
      indicated and guarded against by a logician. When we are told that
      even a professed geometer was imposed upon by these fallacies, we
      learn at once how deep-seated were such illogical deficiencies,
      how useful was Aristotle’s theoretical study in marking them out,
      and how insufficient was his classification when he described the
      Fallacies as obvious frauds, broached only by dishonest
      professional Sophists. As he himself states, the cause of deceit
      turns upon a quite trifling difference; having its root in the
      imperfection of language and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>in our frequent
      habit of using words without much attention to logical

    <p> Under one or other, then, of the thirteen general heads above
      enumerated, all Paralogisms must be included — merely apparent
      syllogisms, or refutations, which are not real and valid;<a name="FnAnchor10_51" href="#Footnote10_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
      and all of them designated by Aristotle as sophistic or eristic.
      Besides these, moreover, he includes, as we saw, under the same
      designation, syllogisms or refutations valid in form, and true as
      to conclusion, yet founded on premisses not suited to the matter
      in debate; <i>i.e.</i>, not suited to Dialectic. Now, here it is
      that difficulty arises. Dialectic and Rhetoric are carefully
      distinguished by Aristotle from all the special sciences (such as
      Geometry, Astronomy, Medicine, &amp;c.); and are construed as
      embracing every variety of authoritative <i>dicta</i>, current
      beliefs, and matters of opinion, together with all the most
      general maxims and hypotheses of Ontology and Metaphysics, of
      Physics and Ethics, and the common Axioms assumed in all the
      sciences, as discriminated from what is special and peculiar to
      each. Construed in this way, we might imagine that the
      subject-matter of Dialectic was all-comprehensive, and that every
      thing without exception belonged to it, except the specialties of
      Geometry and of the other sciences; and such is the usual language
      of Aristotle. Yet in the treatise before us we find him exerting
      himself to establish another classification, and to part off
      Dialectic from a certain other science or art which he
      acknowledges under the title of Sophistic or Eristic.<a name="FnAnchor10_52" href="#Footnote10_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
      Elsewhere he describes Sophistic as occupied in the study of
      accidents or occasional conjunctions; and this characteristic
      feature parts it off from Demonstration and Science. But there is
      greater difficulty when he tries to part it off from Dialectic.
      Where are we to find a clear line of distinction between the
      matter of dialectic debate (gymnastic or testing) on the one hand,
      and the matter of debate sophistic or litigious, on the other? At
      the beginning of the Topica Aristotle assigned, as the
      distinction, that the Dialectician argues upon premisses <i>really</i>
      probable, while the litigious Sophist takes up premisses which are
      probable <i>in appearance only</i>, and not in reality; such
      apparent <i>probabilia</i> (he goes on to say) having only the
      most superficial semblance of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>truth, and being
      seen immediately to be manifest falsehoods by persons of very
      ordinary intelligence.<a name="FnAnchor10_53" href="#Footnote10_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> But I have
      already pointed out that this description of apparent <i>probabilia</i>,
      if considered as applying to fallacious reasoning generally, is
      both untenable in itself, and contradicted by Aristotle himself
      elsewhere. The truth is, that there is no clear distinction
      between the matter of Dialectic and the matter of Sophistic. And
      so, indeed, Aristotle must be understood to admit, when he falls
      back upon an alleged distinction of aim and purpose between the
      practitioners of one and the other. The litigious man (he tells
      us) is bent upon nothing but victory in debate, <i>per fas et
        nefas</i>: the Sophist aims at passing himself off falsely for a
      wise or clever man, and making money thereby.<a name="FnAnchor10_54" href="#Footnote10_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a></p>

        appearance that the Scholiast (p. 306, b. 40) explains the
        meaning of Aristotle in the eleventh chapter of Sophistici
        Elenchi: &#8001; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, &#8001;

        confess that I attach no distinct meaning to the words &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056;
        &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048;, which characterizes the Dialectician as
        contrasted with the Sophist; nor can I learn much from the notes
        either of Waitz, or of Mr. Poste (p. 129, seq.) on the passage.
        Take for example the last half of the Parmenides of Plato, or
        Book <span class="smcap">B.</span> of the Metaphysics of
        Aristotle. Are we to say that in these two compositions Plato
        and Aristotle speculate on to &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945;, or that

    <p> Now, in regard to the distinction of aim or disposition drawn by
      Aristotle between the dialectical disputant and the litigious or
      sophistic disputant, we see at once, as was before suggested, that
      it lies apart from the critical estimate of art, science, or
      philosophy; and that it belongs, so far as it is well founded, to
      the estimate of individuals ethically and politically, as worthy
      men or patriotic citizens. Whether Euripides or Sophokles composed
      finer tragedies (as we find argued in the Ranæ of Aristophanes),
      must be decided by examining the tragedies themselves, not by
      enquiring whether one of them was vain and greedy of money, the
      other free from these blemishes. A theorist who is laying down
      general principles of Rhetoric, and illustrating them by the study
      of Æschines and Demosthenes, will appreciate the oration against
      Ktesiphon and the oration De Coronâ in their character of
      compositions intended for a particular purpose. For Rhetoric it is
      of no moment whether Æschines was venal or disinterested — a
      malignant rival or an honest patriot; this is an enquiry important
      indeed, but belonging to the historian and not to the rhetorical
      theorist. Whether <span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>Aristotle was or was not guided, in
      his animadversions on Plato, by an unworthy and captious jealousy
      of his master, is an interesting question in reference to his
      character; but our appreciation of his philosophy must proceed
      upon an examination, not of his motives but, of his doctrines and
      reasonings as we find them. A good argument is not deprived of its
      force when enunciated by a knave, nor is a bad argument rendered
      good because it proceeds from a virtuous man. Indeed, so far as
      the character of the speaker counts at all, in falsifying the fair
      logical estimate of an argument, it operates in a direction
      opposite to that here indicated by Aristotle. The same argument in
      the mouth of one who is esteemed and admired counts for more than
      its worth; in the mouth of a person of low character it counts for
      less than it is worth.<a name="FnAnchor10_55" href="#Footnote10_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> To
      distribute arguments into two classes — those employed by persons
      of dishonourable character and those employed by honourable men —
      is a departure from the scientific character of Logic.</p>

    <p> As to the other part of the case (if it is still necessary to
      recur to it), touching the peculiarity of the matter of
      sophistical arguments, the inconsistency of Aristotle is most
      apparent. In enumerating the Sophistical Refutations he tells us
      that these fallacies are indeed sometimes palpable and easily
      detected, but that they are often very difficult to detect and
      very misleading; that an unprepared hearer will generally be
      imposed upon by several of them, and even a scientific hearer by
      some; and that, even where the fallacy does not actually deceive,
      the proper mode of meeting and exposing it will not occur unless
      to one previously exercised in Dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor10_56" href="#Footnote10_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> That
      Fallacies <i>In Dictione</i>, taken as a class (though these are
      what he declares to be the most usual <i>modus operandi</i> of
      the sham dialecticians called Sophists<a name="FnAnchor10_57" href="#Footnote10_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>), often
      passed unperceived, and were hard to solve and elucidate even when
      perceived — we know to have been his opinion; for it is not only
      in the Topica and Sophistici Elenchi, but also in the Metaphysica
      and other works,<a name="FnAnchor10_58" href="#Footnote10_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> that he takes pains to analyse and
      discriminate the several distinct meanings <span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>borne by terms
      familiar to every one, such as <i>idem</i>, <i>unum</i>, <i>pulchrum</i>,
      <i>bonum</i>, <i>amare</i>, <i>album</i>, <i>acutum</i>,
      &amp;c., which terms therefore, when employed in argument, were
      always liable to introduce a fallacy of Equivocation or Amphiboly.
      He tells us the like in specifying the seven Fallacies <i>Extra
        Dictionem</i>: that they also were often unnoticed, and required
      vigilant practice to see through and solve. The description in
      detail, therefore, which Aristotle gives (in Sophistici Elenchi)
      of the working process peculiar to the litigious Sophist, is
      completely at variance with the definition which he had given of
      the sophistic syllogism at the commencement of the Topica. That
      definition is indeed suitable for the <i>type-specimens</i> which
      he and other logicians give to illustrate this or that class of
      Fallacies: the type-specimen produced must carry absurdity on the
      face of it, so that the reader may at first sight recognize it as
      a fallacy; and he may even find difficulty in believing that any
      one can really be imposed upon by such trifling. But, though
      suitable for the type-specimen taken separately, this definition
      fails in the essential character which Aristotle postulates for a
      definition, since it is quite untrue and unsuitable for numerous
      instances of the class intended to be illustrated.<a name="FnAnchor10_59" href="#Footnote10_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
      Aristotle was the first who attempted to distribute Fallacies into
      classes, such that, while in each class there were certain
      specimens palpably stamped with the fallacious character, there
      were also in each class an indefinite multitude of analogous cases
      wherein the fallacious character did not reveal itself openly or
      easily, but required attentive consideration to detect it, often
      indeed remaining undetected, and producing its natural fruit of
      error and confusion. This was one of his many great merits in
      regard to Logic; and the classification of Fallacies (modified as
      to details) has passed to all subsequent logicians, so that we
      find difficulty in understanding that the contemporaries of
      Sokrates and Plato had no idea of it. But the value of his service
      to Logic would be much lessened, if all fallacies were sophistic
      syllogisms, intended to deceive but never really deceiving,
      corresponding to his definition at the beginning of the Topica; if
      (as he tells us in the Sophistici Elenchi) they were only impudent
      forgeries put in circulation by a set of professional knaves
      called Sophists; and if all non-sophistical dialecticians, and all
      the world without, could be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>trusted as speaking
      correctly by nature and as never falling into them.</p>

      appeal made by Aristotle to a difference of character and motives
      as the distinction between the Dialectician and the Sophist is all
      the more misplaced, because he himself lays down as the essential
      feature of Dialectic generally, that it is a match or contention
      between two rivals, each anxious to obtain the victory. It is like
      a match at chess between two expert players, or a fencing-match
      between two celebrated masters at arms. Its very nature is to be
      an attack and defence, in which each combatant resorts to
      stratagem, and each outwits the other if he can. Whether the match
      is played for money or for nothing — whether the contentious
      spirit is more or less intense — does not concern the theorist on
      dialectical procedure. It is indispensable that both the
      questioner and the respondent should exert their full force, the
      one in thrusting, the other in parrying: if they do not, the
      purpose of Dialectic, which is the common business of both, will
      not be attained. That purpose is clearly declared by Aristotle. It
      is not didactic: he distinguishes it expressly from teaching,<a name="FnAnchor10_60" href="#Footnote10_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
      where one man who knows communicates such knowledge to an ignorant
      pupil. It is gymnastic, exercising the promptitude and invention
      of both parties; or peirastic, testing whether the respondent
      knows a given thesis in such manner as to avoid being driven into
      answers inconsistent with each other or notoriously false.<a name="FnAnchor10_61" href="#Footnote10_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
      Each party seeks, not to help or enlighten but, to puzzle and
      defeat the other. As at chess or in fencing, to mask one’s
      projects and deceive the adversary is essential to the work and to
      its purpose; each expects it from the other, and undertakes to
      meet and parry it. The theses debated were always such that
      arguments might be found both for the affirmative and for the
      negative.</p>

    <p> According to Aristotle himself, therefore, the Dialectician is
      agonistic and eristic, just as much as the Sophist. If the one
      tries to entrap his opponent for the purpose of victory, so also
      does the other: the line which Aristotle draws between them is one
      not founded upon any real distinction between two purposes and
      modes of procedure, but is merely verbal and sentimental; putting
      aside under a discredited title what he himself disliked. He
      admits that the dialectical questioner, whenever the thesis which
      he undertakes to refute is true, can never refute it except by
      inducing the respondent to concede what is false; that, even <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>where



      the thesis is false, he often can only refute it by some other
      incompatible falsehood, because he cannot obtain from the
      respondent better premisses; that, where the thesis is probable
      and conformable to received opinion, his only way of refuting it
      is by entrapping the respondent into concessions paradoxical and
      contrary to received opinion.<a name="FnAnchor10_62" href="#Footnote10_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> But these
      ends — fallacious refutation, falsehood, and paradox — are the
      very same as those which Aristotle (in the Sophistici Elenchi)<a name="FnAnchor10_63" href="#Footnote10_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
      sets forth as the peculiar characteristics of the litigious
      Sophist. And the improving intellectual tendencies which he
      ascribes to Sophistic, are almost identical with those attributed
      to Dialectic, being declared in very similar words.<a name="FnAnchor10_64" href="#Footnote10_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
      That there were dialecticians of every degree of merit, in the
      time of Aristotle, cannot be doubted; some clever and ready,
      others stupid and destitute of invention. But that there were any
      two classes of dialecticians such as he describes and contrasts —
      one heretical class, called Sophists, who purposely and habitually
      employed the thirteen fallacious refutations, and another orthodox
      class who purposely avoided or habitually abstained from them — we
      may most reasonably doubt. If the argument in the Sophistici
      Elenchi is good at all, it is good against all Dialectic. The
      Sophist, as Aristotle describes him, is only the Dialectician
      looked at on the unfavourable side and painted by an enemy. We
      know that there were in Greece many enemies of Dialectic
      generally; the intense antipathy inspired by the cross-examining
      colloquy of Sokrates, and attested by his own declarations, is a
      sufficient proof of this. The enemies of Sokrates depicted him —
      as Aristotle depicts the Sophist in the Sophistici Elenchi — as a
      clever fabricator of fallacious contradictions and puzzles; to
      which Aristotle adds the farther charge (advanced by Plato before
      him) against the Sophist, of arguing for lucre — which is an
      irrelevant charge, travelling out of the region of art, and
      bearing on the personal character of the individual. If the
      sophistical stratagems were discreditable and mischievous when
      exhibited for money, they would be no less such if exhibited
      gratuitously. The sophistical discourse is not (as Aristotle would
      have us believe) generically distinguishable from the dialectical;<a name="FnAnchor10_65" href="#Footnote10_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
      nor is Sophistic an art distinct from Dialectic while adjoining to
      it, but an inseparable portion of the tissue of Dialectic itself.<a name="FnAnchor10_66" href="#Footnote10_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
      If the Sophist passed himself off as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>knowing what he did
      not really know, so also did the Dialectician; as we know from the
      testimony of Sokrates, the most consummate master of the art. The
      conflict of two minds each taking advantage of the misconceptions,
      short-comings, and blindness of the other, is the essential
      feature of Dialectic as Aristotle conceives it; to which the eight
      books of his Topica are adapted, with their multiplicity of
      distinctions and precepts both for attack and defence. There
      cannot be a game of chess without stratagems, nor a fencing-match
      without feints; the power of such aggressive deception is one
      characteristic mark of a good player. Those who teach or theorize
      on the game do not seek to exclude stratagem, but furnish
      precautions to prevent it from succeeding. Mastery of the art
      assumes skill in defence as well as in attack.</p>

    <p> Doubtless there are rules that require to be observed in the
      dialectical attack and defence, as there are rules for all other
      matches such as chess or fencing. I should have been glad if
      Aristotle had given a precise and tenable explanation what these
      rules were. He describes the Sophist as one who plays the game
      unfairly; but we have already seen that the ends pursued by the
      Dialectician generally are hardly at all distinguishable from
      those aimed at by the Sophist. If we look to the account of the
      means employed by one and the other, we shall in like manner fail
      to see how any real line can be drawn between them.</p>
    <p> Thus, one proceeding declared to be characteristic of the
      Sophist is — that he puts multiplied questions apparently at
      random, without any visible bearing on the thesis; practising a
      sort of fishing examination, in order to obtain some answer of
      which he may take advantage.<a name="FnAnchor10_67" href="#Footnote10_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> But, when
      we turn to the Eighth Book of the Topica, we find Aristotle
      expressly recommending the like manœuvre to the Dialectician;
      advising him to conceal as much as possible the scheme and
      intended series of his questions — to begin as far as possible
      apart from the thesis, to put the questions in a succession
      designedly incoherent and unintelligible, and to obtain (what, if
      obtained, ensured complete success) the full extent of premisses
      necessary for his final refutative syllogism, without the
      respondent being aware that he had conceded them.<a name="FnAnchor10_68" href="#Footnote10_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
      The questioner is farther advised to throw <span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>the respondent off
      his guard by affecting indifference whether each question is
      answered affirmatively or negatively, and by occasionally taking
      objection against himself, in order that he may create the
      impression of a strictly honest purpose.<a name="FnAnchor10_69" href="#Footnote10_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> If we
      compare the interrogative procedure which Aristotle recommends to
      the Dialectician with that which he blames in the Sophist, we
      shall find that the former is even a greater refinement of
      deception than the latter. </p>

        Soph. El. xii. p. 172, b. 9-25.</p>
      <p> Aristotle treats the Sophists as guilty of dishonourable
        proceeding herein — &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957; <span class="gesp">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>

        the dialectic of Sokrates by his opponents: Plato, Hippias
        Minor, p. 373 — &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#964;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#949;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;

    <p> The next trick which we find ascribed to the Sophist is — that
      he conducts the train of interrogation in such manner as to bring
      it upon a ground on which his memory is abundantly furnished with
      topics. Aristotle adds that this may be done well and honourably,
      or ill and dishonourably.<a name="FnAnchor10_70" href="#Footnote10_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> From his
      own admission we see that this practice was not peculiar to
      Sophists, but was common also to those whom he calls
      Dialecticians: like every other part of the procedure, it might be
      done well or ill; but wherein this difference consisted he does
      not further explain. Indeed, when we recollect that the elaborate
      details and classification of the Topica are mainly intended to
      furnish the memory with an abundant store of premisses
      well-arranged and ready for interrogation,<a name="FnAnchor10_71" href="#Footnote10_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> we may be
      sure that every Dialectician who had gone through the trouble of
      learning them would be impatient to apply them; and would make an
      opportunity for doing so, if none were spontaneously tendered to
      him. But, if the answers obtained were totally irrelevant to his
      final purpose of refuting the thesis, they would be nothing but
      embarrassment to him.<a name="FnAnchor10_72" href="#Footnote10_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a> We must, therefore, understand that
      the questions put would be such as tended ultimately to introduce
      that refutative Syllogism which the questioner was bound to
      conclude with. If they were not, he was of course punished by
      failure.</p>

        Soph. El. xii. p. 172, b. 26. In Topic. III. i. p. 116, a. 20,
        Aristotle prescribes the same procedure to the Dialectician. See
        also Waitz’s note on the passage.</p>
      <p> Alexander (in Scholia, p. 267, b. 8) tells us that it was
        customary for the Sophists to put questions lying away from the
        thesis, and he shows this by mentioning the Platonic Protagoras,
        in which he says that the Sophist Protagoras does so. But the
        illustration here produced does not serve Alexander’s purpose.
        The Sophist Protagoras (in the Platonic dialogue so called) is
        represented, not as shifting dialectic from one point to
        another, but as running away from it altogether into long
        discourse and continuous rhetoric (Plato, Protagor. pp. 333,
        334, 335). In respect to the thesis started for debate, the
        dialectic of Sokrates departs from it as widely as that of
        Protagoras, and this is acknowledged at the close of the
        dialogue, p. 361. Compare ‘Plato and the Other Companions of
        Sokrates’, Vol. II. pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#Sidenotev2_23_31">53</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#Sidenotev2_23_39">59</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#Sidenotev2_23_50">70</a>.</p>

        Aristotle himself observes this, Topic. II. v. p. 112, a. 14.</p>
    </div>
    <p> A third manœuvre treated as peculiar to the Sophist is — that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>he
      takes account of the particular philosophical sect to which the
      respondent belongs, and endeavours to bring out by interrogations
      whatever there may be paradoxical in the tenets of that sect.<a name="FnAnchor10_73" href="#Footnote10_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
      But would not any expert Dialectician do just the same? What else
      would be done by Sokrates, if cross-examining an Anaxagorean or a
      Herakleitean? or by Aristotle himself, if interrogating a
      Platonist? </p>

        Soph. El. xii. p. 172, b. 29.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Another proceeding treated as peculiar to the Sophist is — that
      he seeks to drive the respondent into a paradox, by bringing out
      in cross-examination certain well-known antitheses or
      contradictions which subsist together in the opinions of mankind.
      Thus, men profess in their public talk high principles of virtue;
      but secretly and at the bottom of their hearts they desire to get
      wealth or power <i>per fas et nefas</i>. Again, there are two
      kinds of justice: one, that which is just by nature and in truth,
      such as wise men or philosophers approve; the other, that which is
      just according to law or custom, such as the multitude in this or
      in in some other society approve. There is, also, conflict between
      the authority of a father, and that of the wise; between justice
      and expediency; and as to whether it is more eligible to suffer
      wrong or to do wrong.<a name="FnAnchor10_74" href="#Footnote10_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> All these antitheses are presented to
      us in the Platonic Gorgias, to which (<i>i.e.</i>, to the speech
      of Kallikles therein) Aristotle here makes reference; and he
      numbers it among the vices distinguishing the Sophist from the
      genuine Dialectician — to dwell upon such antitheses for the
      purpose of forcing the respondent into paradoxical answers. But,
      surely, the antitheses here fastened upon that obnoxious name are
      of a class utterly opposed to the class of <i>pseudo-probabilia</i>,
      which he tells us are the peculiar game of the litigious Sophist,
      though every man of ordinary intelligence detects them at first
      sight as fallacies. They are all real and serious issues,<a name="FnAnchor10_75" href="#Footnote10_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a>
      having plausible arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, debateable
      without end, and settled by every man for himself according to his
      own sentiment and predisposition. They are exactly the
      subject-matter best fitted for the acute Dialectician. No man
      would be allowed by Aristotle to deserve that title, if he omitted
      to raise and argue them, the thesis being supposed suitable.<a name="FnAnchor10_76" href="#Footnote10_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a>
      Aristotle himself speaks often of the equivocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
      sense of the term justice — of the distinction between what is
      just by nature and what is just according to some local or
      peculiar sentiment.<a name="FnAnchor10_77" href="#Footnote10_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> The manœuvre which Aristotle imputes
      to the Sophist being exactly the same as that which Kallikles
      imputes to Sokrates in the Platonic Gorgias,<a name="FnAnchor10_78" href="#Footnote10_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a>
      it is Sokrates, and not Kallikles, who serves here as illustrating
      what Aristotle calls a Sophist. Indeed, if we read the Gorgias, we
      shall find the Platonic Sokrates there represented as neglecting
      the difference between what is probable (conformable to received
      opinion) and what is paradoxical. He admits that he stands alone
      in his opinion, against all the world, and his opponents even
      imagine that he is bantering them; but he confides in his own
      individual reason and consistency, so as to be able to reduce all
      opponents dialectically to proved contradiction with themselves.<a name="FnAnchor10_79" href="#Footnote10_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>
      Himself maintaining a paradox, he constrains his respondent by
      acute dialectic to assent to it; which is exactly what Aristotle
      imputes to the Sophists of his day as a reproach.</p>

        Plato, Gorgias, pp. 470, 472, 481, 482.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Some predecessors of Aristotle had distinguished arguments or
      discourses into two separate classes — those addressed to the
      name, and those addressed to the thought.<a name="FnAnchor10_80" href="#Footnote10_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> This
      distinction Aristotle disapproves, denying certainly its
      pertinence and almost its reality. There can be no arguments
      addressed to the thought only, apart from the name: all of them
      must be addressed to the name, and through it to the thought.<a name="FnAnchor10_81" href="#Footnote10_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
      Whether an argument is addressed to the thought or not, depends
      not upon any thing in the argument itself, but upon the meaning
      which one respondent or other may happen to attach to the words:
      if the respondent understands it as the questioner intended, it is
      addressed to the thought; if not, not.<a name="FnAnchor10_82" href="#Footnote10_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> To require
      that the questioner shall distinguish accurately the sense in
      which he puts the question, would, according to Aristotle, convert
      him into a teacher — would confound the line between Dialectic and
      Didactic.<a name="FnAnchor10_83" href="#Footnote10_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> And this may be granted; but not
      less, if Dialecticians are to refrain from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>all those
      proceedings which Aristotle notes and condemns as peculiar to the
      Sophist, must they be held to pass into the attitude of teacher
      and learner; the questioner doing what he can, not to embarrass
      but, to enlighten and assist the respondent. The purpose of
      victory, and the stimulus of competition in the double function of
      question and answer (while entirely absent from Didactic), are
      quite as essential to the Dialectician as to the Sophist. That the
      Sophist seeks victory unscrupulously and at all cost, while the
      Dialectician respects certain rules and limits of the procedure —
      is a difference well deserving to be noticed; yet not a <i>differentia</i>
      giving name and essence to a new species. The unfair Dialectician
      is a Dialectician still; all his purposes remain the same, though
      the means whereby he pursues them are altered. This distinction of
      means between the two, Aristotle has taken very insufficient pains
      to point out. Rude and provocative manner, either on the part of
      questioner or respondent, and impudent assumption of concessions
      which have neither been asked nor granted, — these are justly
      enumerated as illustrations of unfair Dialectic.<a name="FnAnchor10_84" href="#Footnote10_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a>
      But the enumeration is most incompletely performed; because
      Aristotle, in his anxiety to erect Sophistic into an art or
      procedure by itself, distinct from and alongside of Dialectic, has
      transferred to it much that belongs to fair and and admissible
      Dialectic. Hence the really unfair and objectionable means are not
      often brought into the foreground.</p>

    <p> Though Aristotle speaks so contemptuously about Sophistic, he
      nevertheless indicates <i>Loci</i> (or general heads of subjects)
      to assist the sophistical questioner in attacking, and precepts to
      the sophistical respondent for warding off attack. On the whole,
      these precepts are not materially different from those laid out in
      the Topica for Dialectic; except that he gives greater prominence
      to Solecism and Tautology, as thrusts practised by the sophistical
      questioner. He insists upon the intellectual usefulness of
      practice in sophistical debate, hardly less than in what he calls
      dialectical, and, as was remarked, upon similar grounds.<a name="FnAnchor10_85" href="#Footnote10_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
      He recommends it as valuable not only for imparting readiness and
      abundance in argument, but also for solitary meditation and for
      investigation of scientific truths. Without it (he declares) we
      cannot become familiar with the equivocations of terms and
      propositions, nor acquire the means of escaping them. If we allow
      ourselves to be entangled in them, without being aware of it, by
      others, we shall also be entangled in them when we <span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>pursue



      reflections of our own.<a name="FnAnchor10_86" href="#Footnote10_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> It is not
      enough to see generally that there <i>is</i> a fallacy; we must
      farther learn to detect at once the precise seat of the fallacy,
      and to point out rapidly how it may be cleared up. This is the
      more difficult to do, because fallacies that we are thoroughly
      aware of will often escape our notice under inversion and
      substitution of words.<a name="FnAnchor10_87" href="#Footnote10_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> Unless we
      acquire promptitude by frequent exercise in such debates, we shall
      find ourselves always unprepared and behind-hand in each
      particular case of confusion. If we complain and condemn such
      debates generally, we shall appear to do so upon no better grounds
      than our own stupidity and incompetence.<a name="FnAnchor10_88" href="#Footnote10_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a></p>

    <p> Accordingly the Sophistici Elenchi contains precepts, at
      considerable length,<a name="FnAnchor10_89" href="#Footnote10_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> to the respondent in a sophistical
      debate, how reply or solution is to be given to the fallacies
      involved in the questions; all the thirteen Fallacies, (the six <i>In



        Dictione</i>, and the seven <i>Extra Dictionem</i>) being
      treated in succession. In conducting his defensive procedure, the
      respondent must keep constantly in mind what the Sophistical
      Refutation really is. He must treat it not as a real or genuine
      refutation, but as a mere simulation of such; and he must so
      arrange his reply as to bring into full evidence this fact of
      simulation. What he has to guard against is, not the being really
      refuted but, the seeming to be refuted.<a name="FnAnchor10_90" href="#Footnote10_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a> The
      refutative syllogism constructed by the sophistical questioner,
      including as it does Equivocation, Amphiboly, or some other verbal
      fallacy, and therefore yielding no valid conclusion, does not
      settle whether the respondent is really refuted or not. If indeed
      the questioner, in putting his interrogation, discriminates the
      double meaning of his words, where they have a double meaning, the
      respondent ought to answer plainly and briefly Yes, or No; either
      affirming or denying what is tendered. But, if the questioner does
      not so discriminate, the respondent cannot reply simply Yes, or
      No: he must himself discriminate the two meanings, and affirm or
      deny accordingly.<a name="FnAnchor10_91" href="#Footnote10_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>Unless he guards
      himself by such discrimination, he cannot avoid falling into a
      contradiction, at least in appearance. The equivocal wording of
      the question will be tantamount to the fallacy of putting two
      questions as one.<a name="FnAnchor10_92" href="#Footnote10_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a></p>

      <p> Aristotle tells us that this demand for a reply brief and
        direct, without any qualifying additions or distinctions, was
        advanced by dialecticians in former days much more emphatically
        than in his own — &#8005; &#964;’ &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#950;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050;

    <p> As the questioner may propound as refutation what seems to be
      such but is not so in reality, so the respondent may meet it by
      what is an apparent solution but no solution in reality, There
      occur various cases, in sophistic or agonistic debate, wherein a
      simulated solution of this kind is even preferable to a real one.<a name="FnAnchor10_93" href="#Footnote10_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a>
      If the question is plausible, the respondent may answer, “Be it
      so”; but, if it involves any paradox in answering, he will answer
      by saying, “So it would appear”: he will thus not be supposed to
      have granted what amounts to refutation or paradox.<a name="FnAnchor10_94" href="#Footnote10_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a>
      Where the question put is such that, while involving falsehood or
      paradox if answered in the affirmative, it is at the same time
      closely or immediately connected with the thesis set up, — the
      respondent may treat it as equivalent to a <i>Petitio Principii</i>,
      and make answer in the negative. Also, where the questioner,
      trying to establish an universal proposition by Induction, puts
      the final question, not under an universal term but, as the
      general result of the particulars conceded (and such like), — the
      respondent may refuse to admit this last step, and may say that
      his antecedent concessions have been misunderstood.<a name="FnAnchor10_95" href="#Footnote10_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a></p>

    <p> If a question is put in plain and appropriate language, answer
      must be made plainly or with some clear distinction; but, where
      the question is put obscurely and elliptically, leaving part of
      the meaning unexpressed, the respondent must not concede it
      unreservedly. If he does, fallacious refutation may very possibly
      be the result:<a name="FnAnchor10_96" href="#Footnote10_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> he may appear to be refuted by that
      which is no real refutation. If, of two propositions, the second
      follows upon the first, but the first does not follow upon the
      second, the respondent, where he has the choice, ought to grant
      the second only, and not the first. He ought not to make a greater
      concession when he can escape with a less;<a name="FnAnchor10_97" href="#Footnote10_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> <i>e.g.</i>,
      he ought to concede the particular rather than the universal.</p>

    <p> Again, among opinions generally received, there are some which
      the public recognize as matters of more or less doubt and
      uncertainty; others, on which they are firmly assured that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>every



      one who contradicts them speaks falsely. When it is uncertain to
      which of these two classes the question put is referable, the
      respondent will be safer in answering neither affirmatively nor
      negatively, but simply, “I go with the received opinions.”<a name="FnAnchor10_98" href="#Footnote10_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a>
      In cases where opinions are divided, he may find opportunity for
      changing the terms, and for substituting a metaphorical equivalent
      as what he concedes. Such change of terms may pass without
      protest, in consequence of the doubtful character of the matter;
      while it will embarrass the questioner in constructing his
      refutation.<a name="FnAnchor10_99" href="#Footnote10_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> The respondent may further embarrass
      him by anticipating questions that seem likely to be put, and by

        (notes, p. 143) &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#962; to be the true reading, instead of

    <p> When the questioner has obtained the premisses which he thinks
      necessary, and has drawn from them a refutative syllogism, the
      respondent must see whether he can properly solve that syllogism
      or not.<a name="FnAnchor10_101" href="#Footnote10_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> A good and proper solution is, to
      point out on which premiss the fallacy of the conclusion depends.
      First, he must examine whether it is formally correct, or whether
      it has only a false appearance of being so: if the last be the
      case, he must distinguish in which of the premisses and in what
      way such false appearance has arisen. If on the other hand the
      syllogism is formally correct, he must look whether the conclusion
      is true or false. Should it be true, he cannot solve the syllogism
      except by controverting one or both of the premisses; but should
      the conclusion be false, two modes of solution are open to him.
      One mode is, if he can point out an equivocation or amphiboly in
      the terms of the conclusion; another mode will be, to controvert,
      or exhibit a fallacy in, one of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor10_102" href="#Footnote10_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>The



      respondent, however, must learn to apply this examination rapidly
      and unhesitatingly: to do so at once is very difficult, though it
      may be easily done if he has leisure to reflect.<a name="FnAnchor10_103" href="#Footnote10_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a></p>

      <p> Mr. Poste translates these last words — “or by a counterproof
        directed against the conclusion:” and he remarks in his note
        (pp. 145-147), “that this assertion — disproof of the conclusion
        of the refutative syllogism is one mode of <i>solution</i> — is
        both manifestly inadmissible, and flatly contradicted by
        Aristotle himself elsewhere.” The words of Aristotle doubtless
        seem to countenance Mr. Poste’s translation; yet the
        contradiction pointed out by Mr. Poste (and very imperfectly
        explained, p. 147) ought to make us look out for another
        meaning; which is suggested by the chapter immediately following
        (xix. p. 177, a. 9), where Aristotle treats of the Fallacies of
        Equivocation and Amphiboly. He tells us that equivocation may be
        found either in the conclusion or in the premisses; and that to
        show it in the conclusion is one mode of solving or invalidating
        the refutation. This is what Aristotle means by the words cited
        at the beginning of this note: &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#949;&#8150;&#958;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#967;
        &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#8182;&#962;. In Mr. Poste’s translation these words mean the same as
        &#7936;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957; used just before, which Aristotle obviously does not
        intend.</p>

    <p> Aristotle then proceeds to indicate the modes in which the
      respondent may provide solutions for each of the thirteen heads of
      fallacious refutation above enumerated. For these thirteen
      classes, he pronounces that one and the same solution will be
      found applicable to all fallacies contained in one and the same
      class.<a name="FnAnchor10_104" href="#Footnote10_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a></p>

    <p> Thus, in the two first of them — Equivocation of Terms and
      Amphiboly of Propositions — duplicity of meaning must be either in
      the conclusion, or in the premisses, of the refutative syllogism.
      If it be in the conclusion, the refutation must at once be
      rejected, unless the respondent has previously admitted some
      proposition containing the equivocal word as one of its terms, so
      that the refutation may appear to contradict it expressly and
      distinctly. But, if it be in the premisses, then there is no
      necessity that the respondent should have previously admitted such
      a proposition; for the equivocal word may form the middle term of
      the refutative syllogism, and may thus not appear in the
      conclusion thereof.<a name="FnAnchor10_105" href="#Footnote10_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a> The proper way for the respondent to
      deal with these questions, involving equivocation or amphiboly, is
      to answer them, at the outset, with a reserve for the double
      meaning, thus: “In one sense, it is so; in another sense, it is
      not.” If he does not perceive the double meaning until he has
      already answered the first question, he must recover himself, when
      he answers the second, by pointing out the equivocation more
      distinctly, and by specifying how much he is prepared to concede.<a name="FnAnchor10_106" href="#Footnote10_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a>
      Even if he has been taken unawares, and has not perceived the
      equivocation until the refutative syllogism has been constructed
      simply and absolutely, he should still contend that he never meant
      to concede what has been apparently refuted, and that the
      refutation tells only against the name, not against the thing
      meant;<a name="FnAnchor10_107" href="#Footnote10_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> so that there is no genuine
      refutation at all.</p>

      the next two Fallacies — those of Composition and Division, or
      Conjunction and Disjunction — when the questioner draws up his
      refutative syllogism as if one of the two had been conceded, the
      respondent will retort by saying that his concession was intended
      only in the other construction of the words. This fallacy is
      distinct from Equivocation; and it is a mistake to try (as some

    <p> The Fallacies of Accent rarely furnish sophistical refutations,<a name="FnAnchor10_110" href="#Footnote10_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a>
      but those of <i>Figura Dictionis</i> furnish a great many. When
      two words have the like form and structure, it may naturally be
      imagined that the signification of one belongs to the same
      Category as that of the other. But this is often an illusion; and
      in such cases a sophistical refutation may be founded thereupon.
      The respondent will solve it by denying the inference from
      similarity of form to similarity of meaning, and by distinguishing
      accurately to which among the ten Categories the meaning of each
      several word or each proposition belongs. When two words thus
      seem, by their form, to belong to the same Category, the
      questioner will often take it for granted, without expressly
      asking, that they do belong to the same, and will found a
      confutation thereupon; but the respondent must not admit the
      confutation to be valid, unless this question has been explicitly
      put to him and conceded.<a name="FnAnchor10_111" href="#Footnote10_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a> A
      question is put which, in its direct and obvious meaning, bears
      only on the category of Quantity, of Quality, of Relation, of
      Action, or of Passion; but the respondent, not aware of the
      equivocation, answers it in such a manner as to comprehend the
      Category of Substance, and is so understood by the questioner when
      he constructs his refutative syllogism. The respondent will secure
      himself from being thus confuted, by keeping constantly in view to
      which of the Categories his answer is intended to refer.<a name="FnAnchor10_112" href="#Footnote10_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a></p>

        Several illustrative examples of this mode of sophistical
        refutation, founded on the Fallacy called <i>Figura Dictionis</i>,
        are indicated in this chapter by Aristotle. The indication
        however, is often so brief and elliptical, that there is great
        difficulty in restoring the fallacies in full, and still greater
        difficulty in translating them into any modern language. </p>
      <p> 1. Is it possible at the same time to do and to have done the
        same thing? — No. To see something is to do something; to have
        seen something is to have done something? — Yes. Is it possible
        at the same time to see and to have seen the same thing? — Yes.</p>
      <p> The respondent has thus contradicted himself. The form of the
        word &#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#957; appears to rank it under the Category &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;. However,
        I think that the mistake really made here was, that the
        respondent returned an answer universally negative to the first
        question.</p>
      <p> 2. Does anything coming under the Category <i>Pati</i> come
        under the Category <i>Agere</i>? — No. But &#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#943;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;,
        &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, all show by their form that they belong to the
        Category <i>Pati</i>? — Yes. Again, &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#964;&#961;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#957;, show
        by their form that they belong to the Category <i>Agere</i>? —
        Yes. You will admit, however, that &#964;&#8056; &#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#957; is &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#943; &#964;&#953;? —
        Certainly. Therefore something that belongs to the Category <i>Agere</i>
        belongs also to that of <i>Pati</i>.</p>
      <p> If we turn back to Aristot. Categ. viii. p. 11, a. 37, we
        shall find that he admits the possibility that the same subject
        may belong to two distinct Categories. </p>
      <p> 3. Did any one write that which stands here written? — Yes. It
        stands here written that you are standing up — a false
        statement; but when it was written the statement was true? —
        Yes. Therefore the writer has written a statement both true and
        false? — Yes.</p>
      <p> Here <i>true</i> and <i>false</i> belong to the Category
        Quality; the statement or matter written belongs to that of
        Substance. What the writer wrote had nothing to do with the
        former of the two Categories; and no contradiction has been made
        out by admitting that the statement <i>was</i> once true and <i>is</i>
        now false.</p>
      <p> 4. Does a man tread that which he walks? — Yes. But he walks
        the whole day? — Yes. Therefore he treads the whole day.</p>
      <p> Here the Category of <i>Quando</i> is confused with that of
        Substance. </p>
      <p> 5. But the most interesting illustration of this confusion of
        one Category with another, is furnished by Aristotle in respect
        of the difference between himself and Plato as to Ideas or
        Universals. According to Plato the universal term denoted a
        separate something apart from the particulars, yet of which each
        of these particulars partook. According to Aristotle it denoted
        nothing separate from the particulars, but something belonging
        (essentially or non-essentially) to all and each of the
        particulars. In the Platonic theory it was an <i>Hoc Aliquid</i>
        (&#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;), or had an existence substantive and separate: in the
        Aristotelian it was a <i>Quale</i> or <i>Quale Quid</i>
        (&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;), having an existence merely adjective or predicative.
        Aristotle maintains that Plato or the Platonists placed it in
        the wrong Category — in the Category of Substance instead of in
        that of Quality.</p>
      <p> Now it is by rectifying this confusion of Categories that
        Aristotle solves two argumentative puzzles which he ranks as
        sophistical:— (1) The argument concluding in what was called the
        ‘Third Man;’ (2) The following question: Koriskus, and the
        musical Koriskus — are these the same, or is the second
        different from the first?</p>
      <p> What is called the ‘Third Man’ was a refutation of the
        Platonic theory of Ideas. Because Plato recognized a substantive
        existence, corresponding to each common denomination connoting
        likeness, apart from all the similar particulars denominated, <i>e.g.</i>,
        a Self-man, or separate self-existent man, corresponding to the
        Idea, and apart from all individual men, Caius, &amp;c. —
        opponents argued against him, saying:— If this is recognized,
        you must also recognize that the Self-man, and the individual
        man called Caius, have also a common denomination and
        similarity, which (upon your principles) corresponds to another
        Ideal Man, or a Third Man. You must, therefore, go on inferring
        upwards to a Fourth Man, a Fifth Man, &amp;c., and so onwards to
        an indefinite number of Ideal Men, one above the other. This was
        intended as a refutation, by <i>Reductio ad Impossibile</i>, of
        the Platonic view of Ideas as separate Entities, each of them
        One and Universal. But Aristotle here treats it as a Sophistical
        Refutation; and he indicates what he calls the solution of it by
        saying that it confounds the Categories of Substance and
        Quality, putting the Universal (which ought to be under the
        Category of Quality) under the Category of Substance. He has no
        right, however, to include this among Sophistical Refutations,
        which are (as he himself defines them) not real but fallacious
        refutations, invented by a dishonest money-getting profession
        called Sophists, and which are solved by pointing out the
        precise seat of the fallacy. The refutation called the ‘Third
        Man’ is so far from being fallacious, that it is valid, and is
        recited as such elsewhere by Aristotle himself (Metaphs. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ix. p. 990, b. <span class="correction" title="amended from '17;'">17);</span>
        while the solution tendered by Aristotle, instead of being a
        solution, is a confirmation, pointing out, not where the fallacy
        of the refutation resides but, where the fallacy of the doctrine
        refuted resides. Moreover, if we are to treat the refutation
        called the ‘Third Man’ as sophistical, we must number Plato
        himself among the dishonest class called Sophists. Here is one
        among the many proofs that the strong line drawn by Aristotle
        between the Dialectician and the Sophist is quite untenable. The
        argument is distinctly enunciated in the Platonic Parmenides
        (pp. 131-133). </p>
      <p> The meaning of the Universal (Aristotle maintains) must be
        considered as predicative only, tacked on to some <i>Hoc
          Aliquid</i>, and belonging to <i>Quale</i> or some other of
        the nine latter Categories. It may be set out as a distinct
        subject for logical consideration and reasoning: but it cannot
        be set out as a distinct existence beyond and apart from its
        particulars (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7957;&#957; &#964;&#953;). It is &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, and it
        cannot even be recognized as &#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957; or &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;-&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, for this
        would put it apart from all the other &#960;&#959;&#953;&#940;, and would be open to
        the refutation above noticed called the ‘Third Man.’ Such is the
        drift of the very difficult passage of the Sophistici Elenchi
        (xxii. p. 178, b. 37-p. 179, a. 10<span class="correction" title="amended from ','">)</span>. I differ from Mr. Poste’s
        translation (p. 71) of part of this passage, and still more from
        the explanation given in the latter part of his note (p. 155). I
        think that the doctrine of &#964;&#8056; &#7955;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940; is produced by
        Aristotle here and elsewhere in his work as untrue and
        inadmissible, not as his own doctrine. Mr. Poste understands
        this passage differently from the previous translators, with
        whom I agree for the most part, though M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire
        appears to me to have missed the hinge upon which Aristotle’s
        argument turns, by translating &#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957; — id ipsum, quod quale
        est (J. Pacius) — “une qualité:” the argument turns upon the
        distinction between &#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957; and &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;.</p>
      <p> I come now to the second sophistical refutation given by
        Aristotle: Koriskus, and the musician Koriskus — are the two the
        same or different? This is what Aristotle calls a sophistical or
        fallacious argument (compare Metaphys. <span class="smcap">E.</span>
        ii. p. 1026, b. 15); but it can hardly be so called with
        propriety, for the only solution that Aristotle himself gives of
        it is, that the two are <i>idem numero</i>, but in an improper
        or secondary sense (Topic. I. vii. p. 103, a. 30); <i>i. e.</i>,
        that they are in one point of view the same, in another point of
        view different — they are &#7955;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;. See Arist. Metaph.
        <span class="smcap">&#916;.</span> vi. p. 1015, b. 16; Scholia, p.
        696, a. 22, seq.; and Alexand. Aphrodis. ad Metaph. pp. 321,
        322, 414, 415, ed. Bonitz. I understand Aristotle to say that
        &#922;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; cannot be properly <i>set out</i> or
        abstracted (&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#954;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;), because it includes two
        Categories (Substance and Quality) in one; wherefore it cannot
        be properly compared either with &#922;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962; simply (Category of
        Substance) or with &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; simply (Category of Quality). It
        seems strange that Aristotle does not notice this argumentative
        difficulty in the discussion which he bestows on &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957; in the
        Seventh Book of the Topica. The subtle reasonings, very hard to
        follow, which Aristotle employs (Physic. V. iv. p. 227) might
        have made him cautious in treating the difficulties of opponents
        as so many dishonest cavils. It is curious that Alexander, in
        reciting the sophistical argument, assumes as a matter of course
        that &#8001; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; is &#8001; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#953; (Schol. ad

      Disjunction, and if the questioner assumes Conjunction, the

      and if the questioner assumes the grave accent, the respondent
      will adopt the acute.<a name="FnAnchor10_113" href="#Footnote10_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a></p>

    <p> Passing to the Fallacies <i>Extra Dictionem</i>, where the
      sophistical refutation is founded upon a Fallacy of Accident, the
      respondent ought to apply one and the same solution to all. He
      will say: <span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>“The



      conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premisses”; and he
      will be prepared with an example, in which the conclusion obtained
      under this fallacy is notoriously untrue.<a name="FnAnchor10_114" href="#Footnote10_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a> “Do you
      know Koriskus?” — “Yes.” “Do you know the distant person coming
      this way?” — “No.” “That distant person is Koriskus: therefore you
      know, and you do not know, the same person.” The inference here is
      not necessary. To be coming this way — is an accident of Koriskus;
      and, because you do not know the accident, we cannot infer that
      you do not know the subject; such may or may not be the case.<a name="FnAnchor10_115" href="#Footnote10_115"><span class="sp">115</span></a></p>

    <p> The major premiss upon which the preceding sophistical
      refutation must rest, is, That it is impossible both to know and
      not to know the same thing. This must be put as a direct question
      by the questioner, and must be conceded by the respondent, before
      the intended refutation can be made good. Now there are some
      persons who solve the refutation by answering this question in the
      negative, and by saying that it is possible both to know and not
      to know the same thing, only not in the same respect: such is the
      case when we know Koriskus, but do not know Koriskus approaching
      from a distance.<a name="FnAnchor10_116" href="#Footnote10_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> Aristotle disapproves this mode of
      solution, as well as another mode which refers the fallacy to
      equivocation of terms. He points out that there are many other
      sophistical refutations, coming under the general head of <i>Fallaciæ



        Accidentis</i>, to which such solution will not apply; and that
      there ought to be one uniform mode of solution applicable to every
      fallacy coming under the same general head; though he admits at
      the same time that particular sophistical refutations may be
      vicious in more than one way. He says, moreover, that this
      contradiction or negation of the premiss is no true solution; for
      a solution ought to bring to view clearly the reason why the
      fallacious refutation appears to be a real refutation. Thus the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span><i>Fallacia



        Accidentis</i> consists in an inference that what is true of an
      accident is true also of the subject thereof: you explain that
      such inference, though apparently cogent, has no real cogency, and
      in that explanation consists the only proper solution of the
      fallacy.<a name="FnAnchor10_117" href="#Footnote10_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a></p>

      <p> Mr. Poste (pp. 152-157) translates &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; —
        “contradicting the thesis,” and he expresses his surprise at the
        assertion, observing (very truly) that contradiction of the
        thesis is the very opposite of a solution; it helps in the very
        work which the refutation aims at accomplishing. But I cannot
        think that &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; does mean “the thesis,” either here or in
        the other passage to which Mr. Poste refers (xxii. p. 178, b.
        14). I think it means a premiss which the respondent has
        conceded, or must be presumed to have conceded, essential to the
        validity of the refutation. The term &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; cannot surely,
        with any propriety, be applied to the thesis. It means either a
        question, or what is conceded in reply to a question; and the <i>thesis</i>
        cannot come under either one meaning or the other, being the
        proposition which the respondent sets out by affirming and
        undertakes to defend.</p>

    <p> In like manner, all those Fallacies which come under the general
      head of <i>A dicto Secundum Quid ad dictum Simpliciter</i>, can
      only be solved by pointing out, in each particular case, in what
      terms this confusion is concealed — wherein resides the inference
      apparently cogent which is mistaken for one really cogent. The
      respondent is driven to an apparent contradiction, by having
      granted premisses from which the inference is derivable that both
      sides of the <i>Antiphasis</i> are true — that the same predicate
      A may be both affirmed and denied of the same subject B. He solves
      the contradiction by analysing the <i>Antiphasis</i>, and by
      showing that affirmation is <i>secundum quid</i>, while denial is
      <i>simpliciter</i>; and that there is a contradiction not real,

    <p> In regard to the Fallacies under <i>Petitio Principii</i>, the

      such a fallacy, must refuse to grant it, however probable it may
      be in itself. If he does not perceive this until after he has
      granted it, he must throw back the charge of mal-procedure upon
      the questioner; declaring that an Elenchus involving assumption of
      the matter in question is null, and that the concession was made
      under the supposition that some separate and independent syllogism
      was in contemplation.<a name="FnAnchor10_120" href="#Footnote10_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a></p>

    <p> There are two distinct ways in which the <i>Fallacia

      universal, comprehending the subject: because animal always goes
      along with man, it is falsely inferred that man always goes along
      with animal; or it is falsely inferred that not-animal always goes
      along with not-man. The fallacy is solved when this is pointed
      out. The last inference is only valid when the terms are inverted;
      if animal always goes along with man, not-man will always go along
      with not-animal.<a name="FnAnchor10_121" href="#Footnote10_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a></p>

    <p> Where the sophistical questioner tries to refute by the <i>Fallacia



        Plurium Interrogationum</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, by putting two or more
      questions as one), the respondent should forthwith divide the
      complex question into its component simple questions, and make
      answer accordingly. He must not give one answer, either
      affirmative or negative, to that which is more than one question.
      Even if he does give one answer, he may sometimes not involve
      himself in any contradiction; for it may happen that the same
      predicate is truly affirmable, or truly deniable, of two or more
      distinct and independent subjects. Often, however, the contrary is
      the case: no one true answer, either affirmative or negative, can
      be given to one of these complex questions: the one answer given,
      whatever it be, must always be partially false or inconsistent.<a name="FnAnchor10_124" href="#Footnote10_124"><span class="sp">124</span></a>

      neither good nor bad. There may indeed be other solutions for this
      fallacy: Both or All may signify two or more items taken

    </div>
    <p> Suppose that, instead of aiming at a seeming refutation, the
      Sophist tries to convict the respondent of Tautology. The source
      of this embarrassment is commonly the fact that a relative term is
      often used and conveys clear meaning without its correlate, though
      the correlate is always implied and understood. The respondent
      must avoid this trap by refusing to grant that the relative has
      any meaning at all without its correlate; and by requiring that
      the correlate shall be distinctly enunciated along with it. He
      ought to treat the relative without its correlate as merely a part
      of the whole significant expression — as merely syncategorematic;
      just as ten is in the phrase — ten <span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>minus one, or as the
      affirmative word is in a negative proposition.<a name="FnAnchor10_126" href="#Footnote10_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a>
      Thus he will not recognize double as significant by itself without
      its correlate half, nor half without its correlate double;
      although in common parlance such correlate is often understood
      without being formally enunciated.</p>

      <p> Mr. Poste observes in his note:— “The sophistic locus of
        tautology may be considered as a caricature of a dialectic
        locus. One fault which dialectic criticism finds with a
        definition is the introduction of superfluous words.” He then
        cites Topic. VI. ii. (p. 141, a. 4, seq.); but in this passage
        we find that the repetition of the same word is declared not to
        be an argumentative impropriety, so that the Sophist would gain
        nothing by driving his opponent into tautology.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Lastly, another purpose which Aristotle ascribes to the Sophist,
      is that of driving the respondent into a Solecism — into some
      grammatical or syntactical impropriety, such as, using a noun in
      the wrong case or gender, using a pronoun with a different gender
      or number from the noun to which it belongs, &amp;c. He points out
      that the solution of these verbal puzzles must be different for
      each particular case; in general, when thrown into a regular
      syllogistic form, even the questioner himself will be found to
      speak bad Greek. The examples given by Aristotle do not admit of
      being translated into a modern language, so as to preserve the
      solecism that constitutes their peculiarity.<a name="FnAnchor10_127" href="#Footnote10_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a></p>

    </div>
    <p> After having thus gone through the different artifices ascribed
      to the Sophist, and the ways of solving or meeting them, Aristotle
      remarks that there are material distinctions between the different
      cases which fall under one and the same general head of
      Sophistical Paralogism. Some cases there are in which both the
      fallacy itself, and the particular point upon which it turns, are
      obvious and discernible at first sight. In other cases, again, an
      ordinary person does not perceive that there is any fallacy at
      all; or, if he does perceive it, he often does not detect the seat
      of the fallacy, so that one man will refer the case to one general
      head, and another, to a different one.<a name="FnAnchor10_128" href="#Footnote10_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> Thus, for
      example, Fallacies of Equivocation are perhaps the most frequent
      and numerous of all fallacies; some of them are childish and
      jocular, not really imposing upon any one; but there are others
      again in which the double meaning of a word is at first unnoticed,
      and is disputed even when pointed out, so that it can only be
      brought to light by the most careful and subtle analysis. This
      happens especially with terms that are highly abstract and
      general: which are treated by many, including even <span class="correction" title="amended from 'philosphers'">philosophers</span>
      like Parmenides and Zeno, as if they were not equivocal at all, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>but
      univocal.<a name="FnAnchor10_129" href="#Footnote10_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a> Again, the <i>Fallaciæ Accidentis</i>,
      and the other classes <i>Extra Dictionem</i>, are also often hard
      to detect. On the whole, it is often hard to determine, not merely
      to which of the classes any case of fallacy belongs, but even
      whether there is any fallacy at all — whether the refutation is,
      or is not, a valid one.<a name="FnAnchor10_130" href="#Footnote10_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a></p>

    <p> The pungent arguments in debate are those which bite most
      keenly, and create the greatest amount of embarrassment and
      puzzle.<a name="FnAnchor10_131" href="#Footnote10_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a> In dialectical debate a puzzle
      arises, when the respondent finds that a correct syllogism has
      been established against him, and when he does not at once see
      which among its premisses he ought to controvert, in order to
      overthrow the conclusion. In the eristic or sophistic debate the
      puzzle of the respondent is, in what language to enunciate his
      propositions so as to keep clear of the subtle objections which
      will be brought against him by the questioner.<a name="FnAnchor10_132" href="#Footnote10_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a>
      It is these pungent arguments that most effectually stimulate the
      mind to investigation. The most pungent of all is, where the
      syllogistic premisses are highly probable, yet where they
      nevertheless negative a conclusion which is also highly probable.
      Here we have an equal antithesis as to presumptive credibility,
      between the premisses taken together on one side and the
      conclusion on the other.<a name="FnAnchor10_133" href="#Footnote10_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> We do not
      know <span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>whether



      it is in the premisses only, or in the conclusion, that we are to
      look for untruth: the conclusion, though improbable, may yet be
      true, while we may find that the true conclusion has been obtained
      from untrue premisses; or the conclusion may be both improbable
      and untrue, in which case we must look for untruth in one of the
      premisses also — either the major or the minor. This is the most
      embarrassing position of all. Another, rather less embarrassing,
      is, where our thesis will be confuted unless we can show the
      confuting conclusion to be untrue, but where each of the premisses
      on which the conclusion depends is equally probable, so that we do
      not at once see in which of them the cause of its untruth is to be
      sought. These two are the most pungent and perplexing
      argumentative conjunctures of dialectical debate.</p>

        is given by Bekker, Waitz, Bussemaker, and Mr. Poste. The
        editions anterior to Bekker had the additional words &#7970;
        &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#940;&#950;&#8131; after &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8135; in the fourth line; and M. Barthélemy
        St. Hilaire in his translation defends and retains them. Bekker
        and the subsequent editors have omitted them, but have retained
        the last words &#7970; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953; in the seventh line. To me this
        seems inconsistent: the words ought either to be retained in
        both places or omitted in both. I think they ought to be omitted
        in both. I have enclosed them in brackets in the fifth line.</p>
      <p> This difficult passage (not well explained by Alexander,
        Schol. p. 320, b. 9) requires the explanations of Waitz and Mr.
        Poste. The note of Mr. Poste is particularly instructive,
        because he expands in full (p. 164) the three “similar
        syllogisms” to which Aristotle here briefly alludes. The phrase
        &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; is determined by a passage in
        Analyt. Priora, II. viii. p. 59, b. 1: it means “employment of
        the contradictory of the conclusion, in combination with either
        one of the premisses, to upset the other.” The original
        syllogism is assumed to have two premisses, each highly
        probable, while the conclusion is highly improbable, being the
        negation of a highly probable proposition. The original
        syllogism will stand thus: All M is P; All S is M; <i>Ergo</i>,
        All S is P: the two premisses being supposed highly probable,
        and the conclusion highly improbable. Of course, therefore, the
        contradictory of the conclusion will be highly probable — Some S
        is not P. We take this contradictory and employ it to construct
        two new syllogisms as follows:— “All M is P; Some S is not P; <i>Ergo</i>
        Some S is not M. And again, Some S is not P: All S is M; <i>Ergo</i>,
        Some M is not P. All these three syllogisms are similar in this
        respect: that each has two highly probable premisses, while the
        conclusion is highly improbable.</p>
    </div>
    <p> But in eristic or sophistic debate our greatest embarrassment as
      respondents will arise when we do not at once see whether the
      refutative syllogism brought against us is conclusive or not, and
      whether it is to be solved by negation or by distinction.<a name="FnAnchor10_134" href="#Footnote10_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a>
      Next in order as to embarrassment stands the case, where we see in
      which of the two processes (negation or distinction) we are to
      find our solution, yet without seeing on which of the premisses we
      are to bring the process to bear; or whether, if distinction be
      the process required, we are to apply it to the conclusion, or to
      one of the premisses.<a name="FnAnchor10_135" href="#Footnote10_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a> A
      defective syllogistic argument is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>silly, when the
      deficient points are of capital importance — relating to the minor
      or to the middle term, or when the assumptions are false and
      strange; but it will sometimes be worthy of attention, if the
      points deficient are outlying and easily supplied; in which cases
      it is the carelessness of the questioner that is to blame, rather
      than the argument itself.<a name="FnAnchor10_136" href="#Footnote10_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a> Both the
      line of argument taken by the questioner, and the mode of solution
      adopted by the respondent, may be directed towards any one of
      three distinct purposes: either to the thesis and main subject
      discussed; or to the adversary personally (<i>i.e.</i>, to the
      particular way in which he has been arguing); or to neither of
      these, but simply to prolong the discussion (<i>i.e.</i>, against
      time). The solution may thus be sometimes such that it would take
      more time to argue upon it than the patience of the auditors will
      allow.<a name="FnAnchor10_137" href="#Footnote10_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a></p>

      <p> Mr. Poste translates these last words very correctly:—
        “Whether it is one of the premisses or the conclusion that
        requires distinction.” Here Aristotle again speaks of a mode of
        solution furnished by applying <i>distinction</i> (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;)
        to <i>the conclusion</i> as well as to the premisses, though he
        does not say that solution can be furnished by applying <i>disproof</i>
        (&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;) to <i>the conclusion</i>. See my remarks, a few
        pages above, on Mr. Poste’s note respecting ch. xviii. (<a href="#Footnote10_102">supra, p. 406</a>).</p>

        Ibid. a. 21.</p>
    </div>
    <p> The last chapter of the Sophistici Elenchi is employed by
      Aristotle in recapitulating the scope and procedure of the nine
      Books of Topica (reckoning the Sophistici Elenchi as the Ninth, as
      we ought in propriety to do); and in appreciating the general
      bearing and value of that treatise, having regard to the practice
      and theory of the day.</p>
    <p> The business of Dialectic and Peirastic is to find and apply the
      syllogizing process to any given thesis, with premisses the most
      probable that can be obtained bearing on the thesis. This
      Aristotle treats as the proper function of Dialectic <i>per se</i>
      and of Peirastic; considering both — the last, of course — as
      referring wholly to the questioner. His purpose is to investigate
      and impart this syllogizing power — the power of questioning and
      cross-examining a respondent who sets up a given thesis, so as to
      drive him into inconsistent answers. It appears that Aristotle
      would not have cared to teach the respondent how he might defend
      himself against this procedure, if there had not happened to be
      another art — Sophistic, closely bordering on Dialectic and
      Peirastic. He considers it indispensable to furnish the respondent
      with defensive armour against sophistical cross-examination; and
      this could not be done without teaching him at the same time modes
      of defence against the cross-examination of Dialectic and
      Peirastic. For this reason it is (Aristotle <span class="correction" title="amended from 'tell'">tells</span> us<a name="FnAnchor10_138" href="#Footnote10_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a>
      that he has included in the Topica precepts <span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>on the best mode of
      defending the thesis by the most probable arguments, as well as of
      impugning it. The respondent professes to know (while the
      questioner does not), and must be taught how to maintain his
      thesis like a man of knowledge. Sokrates, the prince of
      dialecticians, did nothing but question and cross-examine: he
      would never be respondent at all; for he explicitly disclaimed
      knowledge. And if it were not for the neighbourhood of Sophistic,
      Aristotle would have thought it sufficient to teach a procedure
      like that of Sokrates. It was the danger from sophistical
      cross-examination that led him to enlarge his scheme — to unmask
      the Sophists by enumerating the paralogisms peculiar to them, and
      to indicate the proper scheme of the responses and solutions
      whereby the respondent might defend himself against them. We
      remember that Aristotle treats all paralogisms and fallacies as if
      they belonged to a peculiar art or profession called Sophistic,
      and as if they were employed by Sophists exclusively; as if the
      Dialecticians and the Peirasts, including among them Sokrates and
      Plato, put all their questions without ever resorting to or
      falling into paralogisms.</p>

      <p> It appears to me that in one line of this remarkable passage a
        word has dropped out which is necessary to the sense. We now
        read (about the middle) &#8033;&#962; &#959;&#8016; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957;
        &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8033;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962;. Now the words &#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957; as
        the passage stands, must be construed along with &#8033;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962;, and
        this makes no meaning at all, or an inadmissible meaning. I
        think it clear that the word &#8017;&#960;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; or &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953; has dropped out
        before &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962;. The passage will then stand:— &#8033;&#962; &#959;&#8016; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957;
        &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#8017;&#960;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>
        (or <span class="gesp">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>) &#8033;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962;. When this verb
        is supplied the sense will be quite in harmony with what
        follows, which at present it is not. &#928;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957; applies to
        the questioner, but not to the respondent; &#8033;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962; applies to
        the respondent, but not to the questioner; &#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;
        applies to the respondent, and is therefore the fit concomitant
        of &#8033;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#962;. The translation given by Mr. Poste <i>first</i>
        (p. 93):— “professing not only to test knowledge with the
        resources of Dialectic, but also to maintain any thesis with the
        infallibility of science” appears to me (excepting the word <i>infallibility</i>,
        which is unsuitable) to render Aristotle’s thought, though not
        his words as they now stand; but Mr. Poste has given what he
        thinks an amended translation (p. 175):— “Since it claims the
        power of catechizing or cross-examining not only dialectically
        but also scientifically.” This second translation may approach
        more nearly to the present words of Aristotle, but it departs
        more widely from his sense and doctrine. Aristotle does not
        claim for either Dialecticians or Sophists the power of
        cross-examining scientifically. He ascribes to the Sophists
        nothing but cavil and fallacy — verbal and extra-verbal — the
        pretence and sham of being wise or knowing (Soph. El. i., ii. p.
        165).</p>
    </div>
    <p> Aristotle, we have already more than once seen, asserts
      emphatically his claim to originality as having been the first to
      treat these subjects theoretically, and to suggest precepts
      founded on the theory. On all important subjects (he remarks) the
      elaboration of any good theory is a gradual process, the work of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>several



      successive authors. The first beginnings are very imperfect and
      rudimentary; upon these, however, subsequent authors build, both
      correcting and enlarging, until, after some considerable time, a
      tolerably complete scheme or system comes to be constructed. Such
      has been the case with Rhetoric and other arts. Tisias was the
      first writer and preceptor on Rhetoric, yet with poor and
      insufficient effect. To him succeeded Thrasymachus, next
      Theodorus, and various others; from each of whom partial
      improvements and additions were derived, until at length we have
      now (it is Aristotle that speaks) a copious body of rhetorical
      theory and precept, inherited from predecessors and accumulated by
      successive traditions. Compared with this, the earliest attempt at
      theory was indeed narrow and imperfect; but it was nevertheless
      the first step in a great work, and, as such, it was the most
      difficult and the most important. The task of building on a
      foundation already laid, is far easier.<a name="FnAnchor10_139" href="#Footnote10_139"><span class="sp">139</span></a> </p>

    <p> While rhetorical theory has thus been gradually worked up to
      maturity, the case has been altogether different with Dialectic.
      In this I (Aristotle) found no basis prepared; no predecessor to
      follow; no models to copy. I had to begin from the beginning, and
      to make good the first step myself. The process of syllogizing had
      never yet been analysed or explained by any one; much less had
      anything been set forth about the different applications of it in
      detail. I worked it out for myself, without any assistance, by
      long and laborious application.<a name="FnAnchor10_140" href="#Footnote10_140"><span class="sp">140</span></a> There
      existed indeed paid teachers, both in Dialectic and in Eristic (or
      Sophistic); but their teaching has been entirely without analysis,
      or theory, or system. Just as rhetoricians gave to their pupils
      orations to learn by heart, so these dialectical teachers gave out
      dialogues to learn by heart upon those subjects which they thought
      most likely to become the topics of discourse. They thus imparted
      to their pupils a certain readiness and fluency; but they
      communicated no art, no rational conception of what was to be
      sought or avoided, no skill or power of dealing with new
      circumstances.<a name="FnAnchor10_141" href="#Footnote10_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a> They proceeded like men, who,
      professing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
      to show how comfortable covering might be provided for the feet,
      should not teach the pupil how he could make shoes for himself,
      but should merely furnish him with a good stock of ready-made
      shoes — a present valuable indeed for use, but quite unconnected
      with any skill as an artificer. The syllogism as a system and
      theory, with precepts founded on that theory for Demonstration and
      Dialectic, has originated first with me (Aristotle). Mine is the
      first step, and therefore a small one, though worked out with much
      thought and hard labour: it must be looked at as a first step, and
      judged with indulgence. You, my readers, or hearers of my
      lectures, if you think that I have done as much as can fairly be
      required for an initiatory start, compared with other more
      advanced departments of theory, will acknowledge what I have
      achieved, and pardon what I have left for others to accomplish.<a name="FnAnchor10_142" href="#Footnote10_142"><span class="sp">142</span></a></p>

      <p> Cicero, in describing his own treatise De Oratore, insists
        upon the marked difference between his mode of treatment and the
        common rhetorical precepts; he claims to have followed the
        manner of the Aristotelian Dialogues:— “Scripsi Aristoteleo
        more, quemadmodum quidem volui, tres libros in disputatione ac
        dialogo de Oratore, quos arbitror Lentulo tuo fore non inutiles.
        Abhorrent enim a communibus præceptis, atque omnem antiquorum et
        Aristoteleam et Isocrateam rationem oratoriam complectuntur”
        (Cicero, Epist. ad Famill. i. 9).</p>

        address the readers of the present treatise, while by &#964;&#8182;&#957;
        &#7968;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; he designates those who had heard his oral
        expositions on the same subject.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Such is the impressive closing chapter of the Sophistici
      Elenchi. It is remarkable in two ways: first, that Aristotle
      expressly addresses himself to hearers and readers in the second
      person; next, that he asserts emphatically his own claim to
      originality as a theorist on Logic, and declares himself to have
      worked out even the first beginnings of such theory by laborious
      application. I understand his claim to originality as intended to
      bear, not simply on the treatise called Sophistici Elenchi and on
      the enumeration of Fallacies therein contained, but, in a larger
      sense, on the theory of the Syllogism; as first unfolded in the
      Analytica Priora, applied to Demonstration in the Analytica
      Posteriora, applied afterwards to Dialectic in the Topica, applied
      lastly to Sophistic (or Eristic) in the Sophistici Elenchi. The
      phrase, “Respecting the <i>process of syllogizing</i>,<a name="FnAnchor10_143" href="#Footnote10_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a>
      I found absolutely nothing prepared, but worked it out by
      laborious application for myself” — seems plainly to denote this
      large <span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>comprehension.



      And, indeed, in respect to Sophistic separately, the remark of
      Aristotle that nothing whatever had been done before him, would
      not be well founded: we find in his own treatise of the Sophistici
      Elenchi allusion to various prior doctrines, from which he
      dissents.<a name="FnAnchor10_144" href="#Footnote10_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a> In these prior doctrines, however,
      his predecessors had treated the sophistical modes of refutation
      without reference to the Syllogism and its general theory.<a name="FnAnchor10_145" href="#Footnote10_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a>
      It is against such separation that Aristotle distinctly protests.
      He insists upon the necessity of first expounding the Syllogism,
      and of discussing the laws of good or bad Refutation as a
      corollary or dependant of the syllogistic theory. Accordingly he
      begins this treatise by intimating that he intends to deduce these
      laws from the first and highest generalities of the subject;<a name="FnAnchor10_146" href="#Footnote10_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a>
      and he concludes it by claiming this method of philosophizing as
      original with himself.</p>

<h2>
<span class="smcap">PHYSICA AND METAPHYSICA.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Aristotle distinguishes, in clear and explicit language, a science
which he terms Wisdom, Philosophy, or First Philosophy; the
subject-matter of which he declares to be <i>Ens quatenus <i>Ens</i></i>,
 together with the concomitants belonging to it as such. With this
Ontology the treatise entitled Metaphysica purports to deal, and the
larger portion of it does really so deal. At the same time, the line
that parts off Ontology from Logic (Analytic and Dialectic) on the one
hand, and from Physics on the other, is not always clearly marked. For,

If we include both what is treated in the Analytica Posteriora (the
scientific explanation of Essence and Definition) and what is treated in
 the Physica, we shall find that nearly all the expository processes
employed in the Metaphysica are employed also in these two treatises. To
 look upon the general notion as a cause, and to treat it as a creative
force (<i>der schöpferische Wesensbegriff</i>, to use the phrase of Prantl and other German logicians<a name="FnAnchor11_3" href="#Footnote11_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>),
 belongs alike to the Physica and to the Analytica Posteriora. The
characteristic distinction of the treatise entitled Metaphysica is, that
 it is all-comprehensive in respect to the ground covered; that the
expository process is applied, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>not exclusively to any separate branch of <i>Ens</i>, but to <i>Ens</i> as a whole <i>quatenus Ens</i> — to all the varieties of <i>Ens</i> that admit of scientific treatment at all;<a name="FnAnchor11_4" href="#Footnote11_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
 that the same abstractions and analytical distinctions, which, both in
the Analytica and in the Physica, are indicated and made to serve an
explanatory purpose, up to a certain point — are in the Metaphysica
sometimes assumed as already familiar, sometimes followed out with nicer
 accuracy and subtlety.<a name="FnAnchor11_5" href="#Footnote11_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 Indeed both the Physica and the Metaphysica, as we read them in
Aristotle, would be considered in modern times as belonging alike to the
 department of Metaphysics.</p>

<p>
The primary distinction and classification recognized by Aristotle among
 Sciences or Cognitions, is, that of (1) Theoretical, (2) Practical, (3)
 Artistic or Constructive.<a name="FnAnchor11_6" href="#Footnote11_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 Of these three divisions, the second and third alike comprise both
intelligence and action, but the two are distinguished from each other
by this — that in the Artistic there is always some assignable product
which the agency leaves behind independent of itself, whereas in the
Practical no such independent result remains,<a name="FnAnchor11_7" href="#Footnote11_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 but the agency itself, together with the purpose (or intellectual and
volitional condition) of the agent, is every thing. The division named
Theoretical comprises intelligence alone — intelligence of <i>principia</i>,
 causes and constituent elements. Here again we find a tripartite
classification. The highest and most universal of all Theoretical
Sciences is recognized by Aristotle as Ontology (First Philosophy,
sometimes called by him Theology) which deals with all <i>Ens</i> universally <i>quatenus Ens</i>, and with the <i>Prima Moventia</i>,
 themselves immoveable, of the entire Kosmos. The two other heads of
Theoretical Science are Mathematics and Physics; each of them special
and limited, as compared with Ontology. In Physics we scientifically
study natural bodies with their motions, changes, and phenomena; bodies
in which Form always appears implicated with Matter, and in which the
principle of motion or change is immanent <span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>and indwelling (<i>i.e.</i>, dependent only on the universal <i>Prima Moventia</i>,
 and not impressed from without by a special agency, as in works of
human art). In Mathematics, we study immoveable and unchangeable numbers
 and magnitudes, apart from the bodies to which they belong; not that
they can ever be really separated from such bodies, but we
intellectually abstract them, or consider them apart.<a name="FnAnchor11_8" href="#Footnote11_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

Such is Aristotle’s tripartite distribution of Theoretical or
Contemplative Science. In introducing us to the study of First
Philosophy, he begins by clearing up the meaning of the term <i>Ens</i>.
 It is a term of many distinct significations; being neither univocal,
nor altogether equivocal, but something intermediate between the two, or
 multivocal. It is not a generic whole, distributed exhaustively among
correlative species marked off by an assignable difference:<a name="FnAnchor11_9" href="#Footnote11_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 it is an analogical whole, including several genera distinct from each
other at the beginning, though all of them branches derivative from one
and the same root; all of them connected by some sort of analogy or
common relation to that one root, yet not necessarily connected with
each other by any direct or special tie.</p>

<p>
Of these various significations, he enumerates, as we have already seen, four:— (1) <i>Ens</i> which is merely concomitant with, dependent upon, or related to, another <i>Ens</i> as terminus; (2) <i>Ens</i> in the sense of the True, opposed to <i>Non-Ens</i> in the sense of the False; (3) <i>Ens</i> according to each of the Ten Categories; (4) <i>Ens</i> potentially, as contrasted with <i>Ens</i>
 actually. But among these four heads, the two last only are matters
upon which science is attainable, in the opinion of Aristotle. To these
two, accordingly, he <span class="correction" title="amended from 'confides'">confines</span> Ontology or First Philosophy. They are the only two that have an objective, self-standing, independent, nature.</p>
<p>
That which falls under the first head (<i>Ens per Accidens</i>) is
essentially indeterminate; and its causes, being alike indeterminate,
are out of the reach of science. So also is that which falls under the
second head — <i>Ens tanquam verum</i>, contrasted with <i>Non-Ens tanquam falsum</i>.
 This has no independent standing, but results from an internal act of
the judging or believing mind, combining two elements, or disjoining two
 elements, in a way conformable to, or non-conformable to, real fact.
The true <span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>combination or disjunction is a variety of <i>Ens</i>; the false combination or disjunction is a variety of <i>Non-Ens</i>.
 This mental act varies both in different individuals, and at different
times with the same individual, according to a multitude of causes often
 unassignable. Accordingly, it does not fall under Ontological Science,
nor can we discover any causes or principles determining it.<a name="FnAnchor11_10" href="#Footnote11_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 When Aristotle says that the two first heads are out of the reach of
science, or not proper subjects of science, he means that their first <i>principia</i>, causes, or deepest foundations, cannot be discovered and assigned; for it is in determining these <i>principia</i> and causes that true scientific cognition consists.<a name="FnAnchor11_11" href="#Footnote11_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p>
There remains much obscurity about this meaning of <i>Ens</i> (<i>Ens</i>
 &#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962;), even after the Scholia of Alexander (p. 701, a. 10, Sch.
Brand.), and the instructive comments of Bonitz, Schwegler, and Brentano
 (Ueber die Bedeutung des Seienden nach Aristoteles, ch. iii. pp.
21-39).</p>
<p>
The foundation of this meaning of <i>Ens</i> lies in the legitimate <i>Antiphasis</i>,
 and the proper division thereof (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#957;
&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, p. 1027, b. 20). It is a first principle (p. 1005, b. 30)
that, if one member of the <i>Antiphasis</i> must be affirmed as true, the other must be denied as false. If we fix upon the right combination to affirm, we say <i>the thing that is</i>: if we fix upon the wrong combination and affirm it, we say <i>the thing that is not</i> (p. 1012, b. 10). “Falsehood and Truth (Aristotle says, <span class="smcap">E.</span>
 iv. p. 1027, b. 25) are not in things but in our mental combination;
and as regards simple (uncombined) matters and essences, they are not
even in our mental combination:” &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8050;&#962; &#7952;&#957;

In regard to <i>cogitabilia</i> — simple, indivisible, uncompounded —
there is no combination or disjunction; therefore, strictly speaking,
neither truth nor falsehood (Aristot. De Animâ, III. vi. p. 430, a. 26;
also Categor. x. p. 13, b. 10). The intellect either apprehends these
simple elements, or it does not apprehend them; there is no &#948;&#953;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;
concerned. Not to apprehend them is ignorance, &#7940;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;, which sometimes
loosely passes under the title of &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962; (Schwegler, Comm. Pt. II., p.

There remain, as matter proper for the investigation of First Philosophy, the two last-mentioned heads of <i>Ens</i>; viz., <i>Ens</i> according to the Ten Categories, and <i>Ens</i>
 potential and actual. But, along with these, Aristotle includes another
 matter also; viz., the critical examination of the Axioms and highest
generalities of syllogistic proof or Demonstration. He announces as the
first principle of these Axioms — as the highest and firmest of all
Principles — the Maxim of Contradiction:<a name="FnAnchor11_12" href="#Footnote11_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The same predicate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>cannot
 both belong and not belong to the same subject, at the same time and in
 the same sense; or, You cannot both truly affirm, and truly deny, the

The Syllogism is defined by Aristotle as consisting of premisses and a
conclusion: if the two propositions called premisses be granted as true,
 a third as conclusion must for that reason be granted as true also.<a name="FnAnchor11_14" href="#Footnote11_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
 The truth of the conclusion is affirmed conditionally on the truth of
the premisses; and the rules of Syllogism set out those combinations of
propositions in which such affirmation may be made legitimately. The
rules of the Syllogism being thus the rules for such conditional
affirmation, the Principle or Axiom thereof enunciates in the most
general terms what is implied in all those rules, as essential to their
validity. And, since the syllogistic or deductive process is applicable
without exception to every variety of the <i>Scibile</i>, Aristotle
considers the Axioms or Principles thereof to come under the
investigation of Ontology or First Philosophy. Thus it is, that he
introduces us to the Maxim of Contradiction, and its supplement or
correlative, the Maxim of the Excluded Middle.</p>

<p>
His vindication of these Axioms is very illustrative of the philosophy
of his day. It cannot be too often impressed that he was the first
either to formulate the precepts; or to ascend to the theory, of
deductive reasoning; that he was the first to mark by appropriate terms
the most important logical distinctions and characteristic attributes of
 propositions; that before his time, there was abundance of acute
dialectic, but no attempt to set forth any critical scheme whereby the
conclusions of such dialectic might be tested. Anterior to Sokrates, the
 cast of Grecian philosophy had been altogether either theological, or
poetical, or physical, or at least some fusion of these three varieties
into one. Sokrates was the first who broke ground for Logic — for
testing the difference between good and bad ratiocination. He did this
by enquiry as to the definition of general terms,<a name="FnAnchor11_15" href="#Footnote11_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and by dialectical exposure of the ignorance generally prevalent among those who familiarly used them. Plato in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>Sokratic
 dialogues followed in the same negative track; opening up many
instructive points of view respecting the erroneous tendencies by which
reasoners were misled, but not attempting any positive systematic
analysis, nor propounding any intelligible scheme of his own for
correction or avoidance of the like. If Sokrates and Plato, both of them
 active in exposing ratiocinative error and confusion, stopped short of
any wide logical theory, still less were the physical philosophers
likely to supply that deficiency. Aristotle tells us that several of
them controverted the Maxim of Contradiction.<a name="FnAnchor11_16" href="#Footnote11_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Herakleitus and his followers maintained the negative of it, distinctly and emphatically;<a name="FnAnchor11_17" href="#Footnote11_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 while the disciples of Parmenides, though less pronounced in their
negative, could not have admitted it as universally true. Even Plato
must be reckoned among those who, probably without having clearly stated
 to himself the Maxim in its universal terms, declared doctrines quite
incompatible with it: the Platonic Parmenides affords a conspicuous
example of contradictory conclusions deduced by elaborate reasoning and
declared to be both of them firmly established.<a name="FnAnchor11_18" href="#Footnote11_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Moreover, in the Sophistes,<a name="FnAnchor11_19" href="#Footnote11_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 Plato explains the negative proposition as expressing what is different
 from that which is denied, but nothing beyond; an explanation which, if
 admitted, would set aside the Maxim of Contradiction as invalid.</p>

While Aristotle mentions these various dissentients, and especially
Herakleitus, he seems to imagine that they were not really in earnest<a name="FnAnchor11_20" href="#Footnote11_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
 in their dissent. Yet he nevertheless goes at length into the case
against them, as well as against others, who agreed with him in
affirming the Maxim, but who undertook also to demonstrate it. Any such
demonstration Aristotle declares to be impossible. The Maxim is assumed
in all demonstrations; unless you grant it, no demonstration is valid;
but it cannot be itself demonstrated. He had already laid down in the
Analytica that the premisses for demonstration could not be carried back
 indefinitely, and that the attempt so to carry them back was
unphilosophical.<a name="FnAnchor11_21" href="#Footnote11_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> There must be some primary, undemonstrable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>truths;
 and the Maxim of Contradiction he ranks among the first. Still, though
in attempting any formal demonstration of the Maxim you cannot avoid
assuming the Maxim itself and thus falling into <i>Petitio Principii</i>, Aristotle contends that you can demonstrate it in the way of refutation,<a name="FnAnchor11_22" href="#Footnote11_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
 relatively to a given opponent, provided such opponent will not content
 himself with simply denying it, but will besides advance some
affirmative thesis of his own, as a truth in which he believes; or
provided he will even grant the fixed meaning of words, defining them in
 a manner significant alike to himself and to others, — each word to
have either one fixed meaning, or a limited number of different
meanings, clear and well defined.<a name="FnAnchor11_23" href="#Footnote11_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 It is impossible for two persons to converse, unless each understands
the other. A word which conveys to the mind not one meaning, but a
multitude of unconnected meanings, is for all useful purposes unmeaning.<a name="FnAnchor11_24" href="#Footnote11_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 If, therefore, the opponent once binds himself to an affirmative
definition of any word, this definition may be truly predicated of the <i>definitum</i>
 as subject; while he must be considered as interdicting himself from
predicating of the same subject the negative of that definition. But
when you ask for the definition, your opponent must answer the question
directly and <i>bonâ fide</i>. He must not enlarge his definition so as
to include both the affirmative and negative of the same proposition;
nor must he tack on to the real essence (declared in the definition) a
multitude of unessential attributes. If he answers in this confused and
perplexing manner, he must be treated as not answering at all, and as
rendering philosophical discussion impossible.<a name="FnAnchor11_25" href="#Footnote11_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
 Such a mode of speaking goes to disallow any ultimate essence or
determinate subject, and shuts out all predication; for there cannot be
an infinite regress of predicates upon predicates, and accidents upon
accidents, without arriving at an ultimate substratum — Subject or
Essence.<a name="FnAnchor11_26" href="#Footnote11_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> If, wherever you can truly affirm a predicate of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>any
 subject, you can also truly deny the same predicate of the same
subject, it is manifest that all subjects are one: there is nothing to
discriminate man, horse, ship, wall, &amp;c., from each other; every one
 speaks truth, and every one at the same time speaks falsehood; a man
believes and disbelieves the same thing at the same time; or he neither
believes nor disbelieves, and then his mind is blank, like a vegetable.<a name="FnAnchor11_27" href="#Footnote11_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

The man who professes this doctrine, however (continues Aristotle<a name="FnAnchor11_28" href="#Footnote11_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>), shows plainly by his conduct that his mind is not thus blank; that<span class="correction" title="comma omitted">,</span>
 in respect of the contradictory alternative, he does not believe either
 both sides or neither side, but believes one and disbelieves the other.
 When he feels hungry, and seeks what he knows to be palatable and
wholesome, he avoids what he knows to be nasty and poisonous. He knows
what is to be found in the market-place, and goes there to get it; he
keeps clear of falling into a well or walking into the sea; he does not
mistake a horse for a man. He may often find himself mistaken; but he
shows by his conduct that he believes certain subjects to possess
certain definite attributes, and not to possess others. Though we do not
 reach infallible truth, we obtain an approach to it, sometimes nearer,
sometimes more remote; and we thus escape the extreme doctrine which
forbids all definite affirmation.<a name="FnAnchor11_29" href="#Footnote11_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a></p>

It is in this manner that Aristotle, vindicating the Maxims of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle as the highest <i>principia</i>
 of syllogistic reasoning, disposes of the two contemporaneous dogmas
that were most directly incompatible with these Maxims:— (1) The dogma
of Herakleitus, who denied all duration or permanence of subject,
recognizing nothing but perpetual process, flux, or change, each
successive moment of which involved destruction and generation
implicated with each other: <i>Is</i> and <i>is not</i> are both alike and conjointly true, while neither is true separately, to the exclusion of the other;<a name="FnAnchor11_30" href="#Footnote11_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> (2) The dogma of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>Anaxagoras,
 who did not deny fixity or permanence of subject, but held that
everything was mixed up with everything; that every subject had an
infinite assemblage of contrary predicates, so that neither of them
could be separately affirmed or separately denied: The truth lies in a
third alternative or middle, between affirmation and denial.<a name="FnAnchor11_31" href="#Footnote11_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

Having thus refuted these dogmas to his own satisfaction, Aristotle
proceeds to impugn a third doctrine which he declares to be analogous to
 these two and to be equally in conflict with the two syllogistic <i>principia</i> which he is undertaking to vindicate. This third doctrine is the “<i>Homo Mensura</i>”
 of Protagoras: Man is the measure of all things — the measure of things
 existent as well as of things non-existent: To each individual that is
true or false which he believes to be such, and for as long as he
believes it. Aristotle contends that this doctrine is homogeneous with
those of Herakleitus and Anaxagoras, and must stand or fall along with
them; all three being alike adverse to the Maxim of Contradiction.<a name="FnAnchor11_32" href="#Footnote11_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Herein he follows partially the example of Plato, who (in his Theætêtus<a name="FnAnchor11_33" href="#Footnote11_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>),
 though not formally enunciating the Maxim of Contradiction, had
declared the tenets of Protagoras to be coincident with or analogous to
those of Herakleitus, and had impugned both one and the other by the
same line of arguments. Protagoras agreed with Herakleitus (so Plato and
 Aristotle tell us) in declaring both affirmative and negative (in the
contradictory alternative) to be at once and alike true; for he
maintained that what any person believed was true, and that what any
person disbelieved was false. Accordingly, since opinions altogether
opposite and contradictory are held by different persons or by the same
person at different times, both the affirmative and the negative of
every <i>Antiphasis</i> must be held as true alike;<a name="FnAnchor11_34" href="#Footnote11_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
 in other words, all affirmations and all negations were at once true
and false. Such co-existence or implication of contradictions is the
main doctrine of Herakleitus.</p>

 while analysing the Platonic dialogues Theætêtus and Kratylus,
criticized at some length the doctrine here laid down by Plato and
Aristotle. I have endeavoured to show that the capital tenet of
Protagoras is essentially distinct from the other tenets with which
these two philosophers would identify it: distinct both from the dogma
of Herakleitus, That everything is in unceasing flux and process, each
particular moment thereof being an implication of contradictions both
alike true; and distinct also from the other dogma held by others, That
all cognition is sensible perception. The Protagorean tenet “<i>Homo Mensura</i>”
 is something essentially distinct from either of these two; though
possibly Protagoras himself may have held the second of the two, besides
 his own. His tenet is nothing more than a clear and general declaration
 of the principle of universal Relativity. True belief and affirmation
have no meaning except in relation to some believer, real or supposed;
true disbelief and negation have no meaning except in relation to some
disbeliever, real or supposed. When a man affirms any proposition as
true, he affirms only what he (perhaps with some other persons also)
believes to be true, while others may perhaps disbelieve it as
falsehood. Object and Subject are inseparably implicated: we may
separate them by abstraction, and reason about each apart from the
other; but, as reality, they exist only locked up one with the other.</p>

 pp. 325-363: “The Protagorean doctrine — Man is the measure of all
things — is simply the presentation in complete view of a common fact;
uncovering an aspect of it which the received phraseology hides. Truth
and Falsehood have reference to some believing subject — and the words
have no meaning except in that relation. Protagoras brings to view this
subjective side of the same complex fact, of which Truth and Falsehood
denote the objective side. He refuses to admit the object absolute — the
 pretended <i>thing in itself</i> — Truth without a believer. His
doctrine maintains the indefeasible and necessary involution of the
percipient mind in every perception — of the concipient mind in every
conception — of the cognizant mind in every cognition. Farther,
Protagoras acknowledges many distinct believing or knowing Subjects: and
 affirms that every object known must be relative to (or in his
language, <i>measured by</i>) the knowing Subject: that every <i>cognitum</i> must have its <i>cognoscens</i>, and every <i>cognoscibile</i> its <i>cognitionis capax</i>;
 that the words have no meaning unless this be supposed; that these two
names designate two opposite poles or aspects of the indivisible fact of
 cognition — actual or potential — not two factors, which are in
themselves separate or separable, and which come together to make a
compound product. A man cannot in any case get clear of or discard his
own mind as a Subject. Self is necessarily omnipresent, concerned in
every moment of consciousness, &amp;c.” Compare also <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40437/40437-h/40437-h.htm#Sidenotev3_26_62">c. xxiv. p. 261.</a></p></div>
<p>
That such is and always has been the state of the fact, in regard to
truth and falsehood, belief and disbelief, is matter of notoriety:
Protagoras not only accepts it as a fact, but formulates it as a theory.
 Instead of declaring that what he (or the oracle which he consults and
follows) believes to be true, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>absolute
 truth, while that which others believe, is truth relatively to them, —
he lowers his own pretensions to a level with theirs. He professes to be
 a measure of truth only for himself, and for such as may be satisfied
with the reasons that satisfy him. Aristotle complains that this theory
discourages the search for truth as hopeless, not less than the chase
after flying birds.<a name="FnAnchor11_36" href="#Footnote11_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a>
 But, however serious such discouragement may be, we do not escape the
real difficulty of the search by setting up an abstract idol and calling
 it Absolute Truth, without either relativity or referee; while, if we
enter, as sincere and <i>bonâ fide</i> enquirers, on the search for
reasoned truth or philosophy, we shall find ourselves not departing from
 the Protagorean canon, but involuntarily conforming to it. Aristotle,
after having declared that the Maxim of Contradiction was true beyond
the possibility of deception,<a name="FnAnchor11_37" href="#Footnote11_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 but yet that there were several eminent philosophers who disallowed it,
 is forced to produce the best reasons in his power to remove their
doubts and bring them round to his opinion. His reasons must be such as
to satisfy not his own mind only, but the minds of opponents and
indifferent auditors as referees. This is an appeal to other men, as
judges each for himself and in his own case: it is a tacit recognition
of the autonomy of each individual enquirer as a measure of truth to
himself. In other words, it is a recognition of the Protagorean canon.</p>

<p>
We know little about the opinions of Protagoras; but there was nothing
in this canon necessarily at variance either with the Maxim of
Contradiction or with that of Excluded Middle. Both Aristotle and Plato
would have us believe that Protagoras was bound by his canon to declare
every opinion to be alike false and true, because every opinion was
believed by some and disbelieved by others.<a name="FnAnchor11_38" href="#Footnote11_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> But herein they misstate his theory. He did not declare any thing to be <i>absolutely</i> true, or to be <i>absolutely</i>
 false. Truth and Falsehood were considered by him as always relative to
 some referee, and he recognized no universal or infallible referee. In
his theory the necessity of <i>some</i> referee was distinctly
enunciated, instead of being put out of sight under an ellipsis, as in
the received theories and practice. And this is exactly what Plato and
Aristotle omit, when they refute him. He proclaimed that each man was a
measure for himself alone, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>and that every opinion was true <i>to the believer</i>, false <i>to the disbeliever</i>;
 while they criticize him as if he had said — Every opinion is alike
true and false; thus leaving out the very qualification which forms the
characteristic feature of his theory. They commit that fallacy which
Plato shows up in the Euthydêmus, and which Aristotle<a name="FnAnchor11_39" href="#Footnote11_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> numbers in his list of <i>Fallaciæ Extra Dictionem</i>, imputing it as a vice to the Sophists: they slide <i>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter</i>. And it is remarkable that Aristotle, in one portion of his argument against “<i>Homo Mensura</i>,” expressly admonishes the Protagoreans that they must take care to adhere constantly to this qualified mode of enunciation;<a name="FnAnchor11_40" href="#Footnote11_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> that they must not talk of apparent truth generally, but of truth as it appears <i>to themselves</i> or <i>to some other persons</i>,
 now or at a different time. Protagoras hardly needed such an admonition
 to keep to what is the key-note and characteristic peculiarity of his
own theory; since it is only by suppressing this peculiarity that his
opponents make the theory seem absurd. He would by no means have
disclaimed that consequence of his theory, which Aristotle urges against
 it as an irrefragable objection; viz., that it makes every thing
relative, and recognizes nothing as absolute. This is perfectly true,
and constitutes its merit in the eyes of its supporters.</p>

<p>
Another argument of Aristotle<a name="FnAnchor11_41" href="#Footnote11_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> against the Protagorean “<i>Homo Mensura</i>”
 — That it implies in every affirming Subject an equal authority and
equal title to credence, as compared with every other affirming Subject —
 I have already endeavoured to combat in my review of the Platonic
Theætêtus, where the same argument appears fully developed. The
antithesis between Plato and Aristotle on one side, and Protagoras on
the other, is indeed simply that between Absolute and Relative. The
Protagorean doctrine is quite distinct from the other doctrines with
which they jumble it together — from those of Herakleitus and
Anaxagoras, and from the theory that Knowledge is sensible perception.
The real opponents of the Maxim of Contradiction were Herakleitus,
Anaxagoras, Parmenides, and Plato himself as represented in some of his
dialogues, especially the Parmenides, Timæus, Republic, Sophistes. Each
of these philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
 adopted a First Philosophy different from the others: but each also
adopted one completely different from that of Aristotle, and not
reconcileable with his logical canons. None of them admitted determinate
 and definable attributes belonging to determinate particular subjects,
each with a certain measure of durability.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote11_41" id="Footnote11_41"></a><a href="#FnAnchor11_41">41</a></span> Ibid. v. p. 1010, b. 11.</p></div>
<p>
Now the common speech of mankind throughout the Hellenic world was
founded on the assumption of such fixed subjects and predicates. Those
who wanted information for practical guidance or security, asked for it
in this form; those who desired to be understood by others, and to
determine the actions of others, adopted the like mode of speech.
Information was given through significant propositions, which the
questioner sought to obtain, and which the answer, if cognizant,
enunciated: <i>e.g.</i>, Theætêtus <span class="correction" title="amended from 'in'">is</span> sitting down<a name="FnAnchor11_42" href="#Footnote11_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
 — to repeat the minimum or skeleton of a proposition as given by Plato,
 requiring both subject and predicate in proper combination, to convey
the meaning. Now the logical analysis, and the syllogistic precepts of
Aristotle, — as well as his rhetorical and dialectical suggestions for
persuading, for refuting, or for avoiding refutation — are all based
upon the practice of common speech. In conversing (he says) it is
impossible to produce and exhibit the actual objects signified; the
speaker must be content with enunciating, instead thereof, the name
significant of each.<a name="FnAnchor11_43" href="#Footnote11_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> The first beginning of rhetorical diction is, to speak good Greek;<a name="FnAnchor11_44" href="#Footnote11_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
 the rhetor and the dialectician must dwell upon words, propositions,
and opinions, not peculiar to such as have received special teaching,
but common to the many and employed in familiar conversation; the
auditors, to whom they address themselves, are assumed to be commonplace
 men, of fair average intelligence, but nothing beyond.<a name="FnAnchor11_45" href="#Footnote11_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
 Thus much of acquirement is imbibed by almost every one as he grows up,
 from the ordinary intercourse of society. The men of special
instruction begin with it, as others <span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>do;
 but they also superadd other cognitions or accomplishments derived from
 peculiar teachers. Universally — both in the interior of the family,
amidst the unscientific multitude, and by the cultivated few — habitual
speech was carried on through terms assuming fixed subjects and
predicates. It was this recognized process in its two varieties of
Analytic and Dialectic, which Aristotle embraced in his logical theory,
and to which he also adapted his First Philosophy.</p>

But the First Philosophy that preceded his, had not been so adapted. The
 Greek philosophers, who flourished before dialectical discussion had
become active, during the interval between Thales and Sokrates,
considered Philosophy as one whole — <i>rerum divinarum et humanarum scientia</i>
 — destined to render Nature or the Kosmos more or less intelligible.
They took up in the gross all those vast problems, which the religious
or mythological poets had embodied in divine genealogies and had
ascribed to superhuman personal agencies.</p>
<p>
Thales and his immediate successors (like their predecessors the poets)
accommodated their hypotheses to intellectual impulses and aspirations
of their own; with little anxiety about giving satisfaction to others,<a name="FnAnchor11_46" href="#Footnote11_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 still less about avoiding inconsistencies or meeting objections. Each
of them fastened upon some one grand and imposing generalization (set
forth often in verse) which he stretched as far as it would go by
various comparisons and illustrations, but without any attention or
deference to adverse facts or reasonings. Provided that his general
point of view was impressive to the imagination,<a name="FnAnchor11_47" href="#Footnote11_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 as the old religious scheme of personal agencies was to the vulgar, he
did not concern himself about the conditions of proof or disproof. The
data of experience were altogether falsified (as by the Pythagoreans)<a name="FnAnchor11_48" href="#Footnote11_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
 in order to accommodate them to the theory; or were set aside as
deceptive and inexplicable from the theory (as by both Parmenides and
Herakleitus).<a name="FnAnchor11_49" href="#Footnote11_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>

But these vague hypotheses became subjected to a new scrutiny, when the dialectical age of Zeno and Sokrates supervened. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>Opponents of Parmenides impugned his theory of <i>Ens Unum Continuum Immobile</i>,
 as leading to absurdities; while his disciple Zeno replied, not by any
attempt to disprove such allegations but, by showing that the
counter-theory of <i>Entia Plura Discontinua Moventia</i>, or <i>Mutabilia</i>, involved consequences yet more absurd.<a name="FnAnchor11_50" href="#Footnote11_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
 In the acute dialectical warfare, to which the old theories thus stood
exposed, the means of attack much surpassed those of defence; moreover,
the partisans of Herakleitus despised all coherent argumentation,
confining themselves to obscure oracular aphorisms and multiplied
metaphors.<a name="FnAnchor11_51" href="#Footnote11_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
 In point of fact, no suitable language could be found, consistently
with common speech or common experience, for expanding in detail either
the Herakleitean<a name="FnAnchor11_52" href="#Footnote11_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> or the Parmenidean theory; the former suppressing all duration and recognizing nothing but events — a perpetual stream of <i>Fientia</i> or interchange of <i>Ens</i> with <i>Non-Ens</i>; the latter discarding <i>Non-Ens</i> as unmeaning, and recognizing no real events or successions, but only <i>Ens Unum</i>
 perpetually lasting and unchangeable. The other physical hypotheses,
broached by Pythagoras, Empedokles, Anaxagoras, and Demokritus, each
altogether discordant with the others, were alike imposing in their
general enunciation and promise, alike insufficient when applied to
common experience and detail.</p>

Plato applies this remark to the theory of Protagoras; but the remark belongs properly to that of Herakleitus.</p></div>
<p>
But the great development of Dialectic during the Sokratic age, together
 with the new applications made of it by Sokrates and the unrivalled
acuteness with which he wielded it, altered materially the position of
these physical theories. Sokrates was not ignorant of them;<a name="FnAnchor11_53" href="#Footnote11_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
 but he discouraged such studies, and turned attention to other topics.
He passed his whole life in public and in indiscriminate conversation
with every one. He deprecated astronomy and physics as unbecoming
attempts to pry into the secrets of the gods; who administered the
general affairs of the Kosmos according to their own pleasure, and
granted only, through the medium of prophecy or oracles, such special
revelations as they thought fit. In his own discussions Sokrates dwelt
only on matters of familiar conversation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>and
 experience — social, ethical, political, &amp;c., such as were in every
 one’s mouth, among the daily groups of the market-place. These he
declared to be the truly <i>human</i> topics<a name="FnAnchor11_54" href="#Footnote11_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a>
 — the proper study of mankind — upon which it was disgraceful to be
ignorant, or to form untrue and inconsistent judgments. He found,
moreover, that upon these topics no one supposed himself to be ignorant,
 or to require teaching. Every one gave confident opinions, derived from
 intercourse with society, embodied in the familiar words of the
language, and imbibed almost unconsciously along with the meaning of
these words. Now Sokrates not only disclaimed all purpose of teaching,
but made ostentatious profession of his own ignorance. His practice was
to ask information from others who professed to know; and with this
view, to question them about the import of vulgar words with the social

 To the answers given he applied an acute cross-examination, which
seldom failed to detect so much inconsistency and contradiction as to
cover the respondent with shame, and to make him sensible that he was
profoundly ignorant of matters which he had believed himself to know
well. Sokrates declared, in his last speech before condemnation by the
Athenian Dikasts, that such false persuasion of knowledge, combined with
 real ignorance, was universal among mankind; and that the exposure
thereof, as the great misguiding force of human life, had been enjoined
upon him as his mission by the Delphian God.<a name="FnAnchor11_56" href="#Footnote11_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a></p>

The peculiarities which Aristotle ascribes to Sokrates are — that he
talked upon ethical topics instead of physical, that he fastened
especially on the definitions of general terms, and that his discussions
 were inductive, bringing forward many analogous illustrative or
probative particulars to justify a true general proposition, and one or a
 few to set aside a false one.<a name="FnAnchor11_57" href="#Footnote11_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>Sokratic
 practice is copiously illustrated both by Plato in many of his
dialogues, and by Xenophon throughout all the Memorabilia.<a name="FnAnchor11_58" href="#Footnote11_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a>
 In Plato, however, Sokrates is often introduced as spokesman of
doctrines not his own; while in Xenophon we have before us the real man
as he talked in the market-place, and apparently little besides.
Xenophon very emphatically exhibits to us a point which in Plato’s
Dialogues of Search is less conspicuously marked, though still apparent:
 viz., the power possessed by Sokrates of accommodating himself to the
ordinary mind in all its varieties — his habit of dwelling on the homely
 and familiar topics of the citizen’s daily life — his constant appeal
to small and even vulgar details, as the way of testing large and
imposing generalities.<a name="FnAnchor11_59" href="#Footnote11_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 Sokrates possessed to a surprising degree the art of selecting
arguments really persuasive to ordinary non-theorizing men; so as often
to carry their assent along with him, and still oftener to shake their
previous beliefs, if unwarranted, or even if adopted by mere passive
receptivity without preliminary reflection and comparison.</p>

Without departing from Aristotle’s description, therefore, we may
conceive the change operated by Sokrates in philosophical discussion
under a new point of view. In exchanging Physics for Ethics, it
vulgarized both the topics and the talk of philosophy. Physical
philosophy as it stood in the age of Sokrates (before Aristotle had
broached his peculiar definition of Nature) was merely an obscure,
semi-poetical, hypothetical <i>Philosophia Prima</i>,<a name="FnAnchor11_60" href="#Footnote11_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> or rather <i>Philosophia Prima</i> and <i>Philosophia Secunda</i>
 blended in one. This is true of all its varieties, — of the Ionic
philosophers as well as of Pythagoras, Parmenides, Herakleitus,
Anaxagoras, Empedokles, and even Demokritus. Such philosophy, dimly
enunciated and only half intelligible,<a name="FnAnchor11_61" href="#Footnote11_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
 not merely did not tend to explain or clear up phenomenal experiences,
but often added new difficulties of its own. It presented itself
sometimes even as discrediting, overriding, and contradicting <span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>experience; but never as opening any deductive road from the Universal down to its particulars.<a name="FnAnchor11_62" href="#Footnote11_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>
 Such theories, though in circulation among a few disciples and
opponents, were foreign and unsuitable to the talk of ordinary men. To
pass from these cloudy mysteries to social topics and terms which were
in every one’s mouth, was the important revolution in philosophy
introduced in the age of Sokrates, and mainly by him.</p>

Aristotle indicates how much the <i>Philosophia Prima</i> of his earlier predecessors was uncongenial to and at variance with phenomenal experience — Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span> v. p. 986, b. 31.</p>
<p>
To shape their theories in such a way — &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#949;&#7984; &#956;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#957; (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#923;.</span>
 viii. p. 1073, b. 36), was an obligation which philosophers hardly felt
 incumbent on them prior to the Aristotelian age. Compare Simplikius
(ad. Aristot. Physic. I.), p. 328, a. 1-26, Schol. Br.; Schol. (ad.
Aristot. De Cœlo III. I.) p. 509, a. 26-p. 510, a. 13.</p></div>
<p>
The drift of the Sokratic procedure was to bring men into the habit of
defining those universal terms which they had hitherto used undefined,
the definitions being verified by induction of particulars as the
ultimate authority. It was a procedure built upon common speech, but
improving on common speech; the talk of every man being in propositions,
 each including a subject and predicate, but neither subject nor
predicate being ever defined. It was the mission of Sokrates to make men
 painfully sensible of that deficiency, as well as to enforce upon them
the inductive evidence by which alone it could be rectified. Now the
Analytic and Dialectic of Aristotle grew directly out of this Sokratic
procedure, and out of the Platonic dialogues in so far as they enforced
and illustrated it. When Sokrates had supplied the negative stimulus and
 indication of what was amiss, together with the appeal to Induction as
final authority, Aristotle furnished, or did much to furnish, the
positive analysis and complementary precepts, necessary to clear up,
justify, and assure the march of reasoned truth.<a name="FnAnchor11_63" href="#Footnote11_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> What Aristotle calls the syllogistic <i>principia</i>, or the principles of syllogistic demonstration, are nothing else than the steps <span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>440</span>towards
 reasoned truth, and the precautions against those fallacious
appearances that simulate it. The steps are stated in their most general
 terms, as involving both Deduction and Induction; though in Aristotle
we find the deductive portion copiously unfolded and classified, while
Induction, though recognized as the only verifying foundation of the
whole, is left without expansion or illustration.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote11_63" id="Footnote11_63"></a><a href="#FnAnchor11_63">63</a></span>
 Though the theorizing and the analysis of Aristotle presuppose and
recognize the Sokratic procedure, yet, if we read the Xenophontic
Memorabilia, IV. vii., and compare therewith the first two chapters of
Aristotle’s Metaphysica, in which he describes and extols <i>Philosophia Prima</i>,
 we shall see how radically antipathetic were the two points of view:
Sokrates confining himself to practical results — &#956;&#941;&#967;&#961;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8032;&#966;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#8166;;
Aristotle extolling <i>Philosophia Prima</i>, because it soars above
practical results, and serves as its own reward, elevating the
philosopher to a partial communion with the contemplative
self-sufficiency of the Gods. Indeed the remark of Aristotle, p. 983, a.
 1-6, denying altogether the jealousy ascribed to the Gods, &amp;c., is
almost a reply to the opinion expressed by Sokrates, that a man by such
overweening researches brought upon himself the displeasure of the Gods,
 as prying into their secrets (Xen. Mem. IV. vii. 6; I. i. 12).</p></div>
<p>
If we go through the Sokratic conversations as reported in the
Memorabilia of Xenophon, we shall find illustration of what has been
just stated: we shall see Sokrates recognizing and following the common
speech of men, in propositions combining subject and predicate; but
trying to fix the meaning of both these terms, and to test the
consistency of the universal predications by appeal to particulars. The
syllogizing and the inductive processes are exhibited both of them in
actual work on particular points of discussion. Now on these processes
Aristotle brings his analysis to bear, eliciting and enunciating in
general terms their <i>principia</i> and their conditions. We have seen that he expressly declares the analysis of these <i>principia</i> to belong to First Philosophy.<a name="FnAnchor11_64" href="#Footnote11_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> And thus it is that First Philosophy as conceived by Aristotle, acknowledges among its <i>fundamenta</i>
 the habits of common Hellenic speech; subject only to correction and
control by the Sokratic cross-examining and testing discipline. He
stands distinguished among the philosophers for the respectful attention
 with which he collects and builds upon the beliefs actually prevalent
among mankind.<a name="FnAnchor11_65" href="#Footnote11_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
 Herein as well as in other respects his First Philosophy not only
differed from that of all the pre-Sokratic philosophers (such as
Herakleitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, &amp;c.) by explaining the <i>principia</i>
 of Analytic and Dialectic as well as those of Physics and Physiology,
but it also differed from that of the post-Sokratic and semi-Sokratic
Plato, by keeping up a closer communion both with Sokrates and with
common speech. Though Plato in his Dialogues of Search appears to apply
the inductive discipline of Sokrates, and to handle the Universal as
referable to and dependent upon its particulars; yet the Platonic <i>Philosophia Prima</i> proceeds upon a view totally different. It is a fusion of Parmenides with Herakleitus;<a name="FnAnchor11_66" href="#Footnote11_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> divorcing the Universal altogether from its particulars; treating the Universal as an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>441</span>independent
 reality and as the only permanent reality; negating the particulars as
so many unreal, evanescent, ever-changing copies or shadows thereof.
Aristotle expressly intimates his dissent from the divorce or separation
 thus introduced by Plato. He proclaims his adherence to the practice of
 Sokrates, which kept the two elements together, and which cognized
particulars as the ultimate reality and test for the Universal.<a name="FnAnchor11_67" href="#Footnote11_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a>
 Upon this doctrine his First Philosophy is built: being distinguished
hereby from all the other varieties broached by either his predecessors
or contemporaries. </p>

<p>
The Maxim of Contradiction, which Aristotle proclaims as the first and firmest <i>principium</i>
 of syllogizing, may be found perpetually applied to particular cases
throughout the Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Sokratic dialogues of
Plato. Indeed the Elenchus for which Sokrates was so distinguished, is
nothing more than an ever-renewed and ingenious application of it;
illustrating the painful and humiliating effect produced even upon
common minds by the shock of a plain contradiction, when a respondent,
having at first confidently laid down some universal affirmative, finds
himself unexpectedly compelled to admit, in some particular case, the
contradictory negative. As against a Herakleitean, who saw no difficulty
 in believing both sides of the contradiction to be true at once, the
Sokratic Elenchus would have been powerless. What Aristotle did was, to
abstract and elicit the general rules of the process; to classify
propositions according to their logical value, in such manner that he
could formulate clearly the structure of the two propositions between
which an exact contradictory antitheses subsisted. The important logical
 distinctions between propositions <i>contradictory</i> and propositions <i>contrary</i>,
 was first clearly enunciated by Aristotle; and, until this had been
done, the Maxim of Contradiction could not have been laid down in a
defensible manner. Indeed we may remark that, while this Maxim is first
promulgated as a formula of First Philosophy in Book <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> of the Metaphysica, it had already been tacitly assumed and applied by Aristotle throughout the De <span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>Interpretatione,
 Analytica, and Topica, as if it were obvious and uncontested. The First
 Philosophy of Aristotle was adapted to the conditions of ordinary
colloquy as amended and tested by Sokrates, furnishing the theoretical
basis of his practical Logic.</p>
<p>
But, as Aristotle tells us, there were several philosophers and
dialecticians who did not recognize the Maxim; maintaining that the same
 proposition might be at once true and false — that it was possible for
the same thing both to be and not to be. How is he to deal with these
opponents? He admits that he cannot demonstrate the Maxim against them,
and that any attempt to do this would involve <i>Petitio Principii</i>. But he contends for the possibility of demonstrating it in a peculiar way — <i>refutatively</i> or <i>indirectly</i>;
 that is, provided that the opponents can be induced to grant (not
indeed the truth of any proposition, to the exclusion of its
contradictory antithesis, which concession he admits would involve <i>Petitio Principii</i>,
 but) the fixed and uniform signification of terms and propositions.
Aristotle contends that the opponents ought to grant thus much, under
penalty of being excluded from discussion as incapables or mere plants.<a name="FnAnchor11_68" href="#Footnote11_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> I do not imagine that the opponents themselves would have felt obliged to grant as much as he here demands. The <i>onus probandi</i>
 lay upon him, as advancing a positive theory; and he would have found
his indirect or refutative demonstration not more available in
convincing them than a direct or ordinary demonstration. Against
respondents who proclaim as their thesis the negative of the Maxim of
Contradiction, refutation and demonstration are equally impossible. No
dialectical discussion could ever lead to any result; for you can never
prove more against them than what their own thesis unequivocally avows.<a name="FnAnchor11_69" href="#Footnote11_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
 As against Herakleitus and Anaxagoras, I do not think that Aristotle’s
qualified vindication of the Maxim has any effective bearing.</p>
<p>

<p>
But Aristotle is quite right in saying that neither dialectical debate
nor demonstration can be carried on unless terms and propositions be
defined, and unless to each term there be assigned one special
signification, or a limited number of special significations — excluding
 a certain number of others. This demand for definitions, and also the
multiplied use of inductive interrogations, keeping the Universal
implicated with and dependent upon its particulars — are the innovations
 which Aristotle expressly places to the credit of Sokrates. The
Sokratic Elenchus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
 operated by first obtaining from the respondent a definition, and then
testing it through a variety of particulars: when the test brought out a
 negative as against the pre-asserted affirmative, the contradiction
between the two was felt as an intellectual shock by the respondent,
rendering it impossible to believe both at once; and the unrivalled
acuteness of Sokrates was exhibited in rendering such shock peculiarly
pungent and humiliating. But the Sokratic Elenchus presupposes this
psychological fact, common to most minds, ordinary as well as superior, —
 the intellectual shock felt when incompatible beliefs are presented to
the mind at once. If the collocutors of Sokrates had not been so
constituted by nature, the magic of his colloquy would have been unfelt
and inoperative. Against a Herakleitean, who professed to feel no
difficulty in believing both sides of a contradiction at once, he could
have effected nothing: and if not he, still less any other dialectician.
 Proof and disproof, as distinguished one from the other, would have had
 no meaning; dialectical debate would have led to no result.</p>
<p>
Thus, then, although Aristotle was the first to enunciate the Maxim of
Contradiction in general terms, after having previously originated that
logical distinction of contrary and contradictory Propositions and
doctrine of legitimate <i>Antiphasis</i> which rendered such enunciation
 possible, — yet, when he tries to uphold it against dissentients, it
cannot be said that he has correctly estimated the logical position of
those whom he was opposing, or the real extent to which the defence of
the Maxim can be carried without incurring the charge of <i>Petitio Principii</i>. As against Protagoras, no defence was needed, for the Protagorean “<i>Homo Mensura</i>”
 is not incompatible with the Maxim of Contradiction; while, as against
Herakleitus, Anaxagoras, Parmenides, &amp;c., no defence was
practicable, and the attempt of Aristotle to construct one appears to me
 a failure. All that can be really done in the way of defence is, to
prove the Maxim in its general enunciation by an appeal to particular
cases: if your opponent is willing to grant these particular cases, you
establish the general Maxim against him by way of Induction; if he will
not grant them, you cannot prove the general Maxim at all. Suppose you
are attempting to prove to an Herakleitean that an universal affirmative
 and its contradictory particular negative cannot be both true at once.
You begin by asking him about particular cases, Whether it is possible
that the two propositions — All men are mortal, and, Some men are not
mortal — can both be true at once? If he admits that these two
propositions cannot both be true at once, if he admits the like with
regard to other similar <span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span>pairs
 of contradictories, and if he can suggest no similar pair in which both
 propositions are true at once, then you may consider yourself as having
 furnished a sufficient inductive proof, and you may call upon him to
admit the Maxim of Contradiction in its general enunciation. But, if he
will not admit it in the particular cases which you tender, or if, while
 admitting it in these, he himself can tender other cases in which he
considers it inadmissible, then you have effected nothing sufficient to
establish the general Maxim against him. The case is not susceptible of
any other or better proof. It is in vain that Aristotle tries to
diversify the absurdity, and to follow it out into collateral absurd
consequences. If the Herakleitean does not feel any repulsive shock of
contradiction in a definite particular case, if he directly announces
that he believes the two propositions to be both at once true, then the
collateral inconsistencies and derivative absurdities, which Aristotle
multiplies against him, will not shock him more than the direct
contradiction in its naked form. Neither the general reasoning of
Aristotle, nor the Elenchus of Sokrates brought to bear in particular
cases, would make any impression upon him; since he will not comply with
 either of the two conditions required for the Sokratic Elenchus: he
will neither declare definitions, nor give suitable point and sequence
to inductive interrogatories.</p>
<p>
Nor is anything gained, as Aristotle supposes, by reminding the
Herakleitean of his own practice in the daily concerns of life and in
conversation with common persons: that he feeds himself with bread
to-day, in the confidence that it has the same properties as it had
yesterday;<a name="FnAnchor11_70" href="#Footnote11_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a>
 that, if he wishes either to give or to obtain information, the speech
which he utters or that which he acts upon must be either affirmative or
 negative. He will admit that he acts in this way, but he will tell you
that he has no certainty of being right; that the negative may be true
as well as the affirmative. He will grant that there is an inconsistency
 between such acts of detail and the principles of the Herakleitean
doctrine, which recognize no real stability of any thing, but only
perpetual flux or process; but inconsistency in detail will not induce
him to set aside his principles. The truth is, that neither Herakleitus,
 nor Parmenides, nor Anaxagoras, nor Pythagoras, gave themselves much
trouble to reconcile Philosophy with facts of detail. Each fastened upon
 some grand and impressive primary hypothesis, illustrated it by a few
obvious facts in harmony therewith, and disregarded altogether the mass <span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>of
 contradictory facts. That a favourite hypothesis should contradict
physical details, was noway shocking to them. Both the painful feeling
accompanying that shock, and the disposition to test the value of the
hypothesis by its consistency with inductive details, became first
developed and attended to in the dialectical age, mainly through the
working of Sokrates. The Analytic and the First Philosophy of Aristotle
were constructed after the time of Sokrates, and with regard, in a very
great degree, to the Sokratic tests and conditions — to the
indispensable necessity for definite subjects and predicates, capable of
 standing the inductive scrutiny of particulars. In this respect the <i>Philosophia Prima</i>
 of Aristotle stands distinguished from that of any of the earlier
philosophers, and even from that of Plato. He departed from Plato by
recognizing the <i>Hoc Aliquid</i> or the definite Individual, with its

<p>
To understand Aristotle’s Psychology, we must look at it in comparison
with the views of other ancient Greek philosophers on the same subject,
as far as our knowledge will permit. Of these ancient philosophers, none
 have been preserved to us except Plato, and to a certain extent
Epikurus, reckoning the poem of Lucretius as a complement to the
epistolary remnants of Epikurus himself. The predecessors of Aristotle
(apart from Plato) are known only through small fragments from
themselves, and imperfect notices by others; among which notices the
best are from Aristotle himself.</p>
<p>
In the Timæus of Plato we find Psychology, in a very large and
comprehensive sense, identified with Kosmology. The Kosmos, a scheme of
rotatory spheres, has both a soul and a body: of the two, the soul is
the prior, grander, and predominant, though both of them are constructed
 or put together by the Divine Architect or Demiurgus. The kosmical
soul, rooted at the centre, and stretched from thence through and around
 the whole, is endued with self-movement, and with the power of
initiating movement in the kosmical body; moreover, being cognitive as
well as motive, it includes in itself three ingredients mixed
together:—(1) The Same — the indivisible and unchangeable essence of
Ideas; (2) The Diverse — the Plural — the divisible bodies or elements;
(3) A Compound, formed of both these ingredients melted into one. As the
 kosmical soul is intended to know all the three — <i>Idem</i>, <i>Diversum</i>, and <i>Idem</i> with <i>Diversum</i>
 in one, so it must comprise in its own nature all the three
ingredients, according to the received Axiom — Like knows like — Like is
 known by Like. The ingredients are blended together according to a
scale of harmonic proportion. The element <i>Idem</i> is placed in an even and undivided rotation of the outer or sidereal sphere of the Kosmos; the element <i>Diversum</i>
 is distributed among the rotations, all oblique, of the seven interior
planetary spheres, that is, the five planets, with the Sun and Moon.
Impressions of identity and diversity, derived either <span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>from
 the ideal and indivisible, or from the sensible and divisible, are thus
 circulated by the kosmical soul throughout its own entire range, yet
without either voice or sound. Reason and Science are propagated by the
circle of <i>Idem</i>: Sense and Opinion, by those of <i>Diversum</i>. When these last-mentioned circles are in right movement, the opinions circulated are true and trustworthy.<a name="FnAnchor12_1" href="#Footnote12_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote12_1" id="Footnote12_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor12_1">1</a></span> See this doctrine of the Timæus more fully expounded in ‘Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates,’ III. xxxvi. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40438/40438-h/40438-h.htm#Sidenotev4_38_8">pp. 250-256</a>, seq.</p></div>
<p>
It is thus that Plato begins his Psychology with Kosmology: the Kosmos
is in his view a divine immortal being or animal, composed of a
spherical rotatory body and a rational soul, cognitive as well as
motive. Among the tenants of this Kosmos are included, not only gods,
who dwell in the peripheral or celestial regions, but also men, birds,
quadrupeds, and fishes. These four inhabit the more central or lower
regions of air, earth, and water. In describing men and the inferior
animals, Plato takes his departure from the divine Kosmos, and proceeds
downwards by successive stages of increasing degeneracy and corruption.
The cranium of man was constructed as a little Kosmos, including in
itself an immortal rational soul, composed of the same materials, though
 diluted and adulterated, as the kosmical soul; and moving with the like
 rotations, though disturbed and irregular, suited to a rational soul.
This cranium, for wise purposes which Plato indicates, was elevated by
the gods upon a tall body, with attached limbs for motion in different
directions — forward, backward, upward, downward, to the right and left.<a name="FnAnchor12_2" href="#Footnote12_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 Within this body were included two inferior and mortal souls: one in
the thoracic region near the heart, the other lower down, below the
diaphragm, in the abdominal region; but both of them fastened or rooted
in the spinal marrow or cord, which formed a continuous line with the
brain above. These two souls were both emotional; the higher or <i>thoracic</i> soul being the seat of courage, energy, anger, &amp;c., while to the lower or <i>abdominal</i>
 soul belonged appetite, desires, love of gain, &amp;c. Both of them
were intended as companions and adjuncts, yet in the relation of
dependence and obedience, to the <i>rational</i> soul in the cranium
above; which, though unavoidably debased and perturbed by such unworthy
companionship, was protected partially against the contagion by the
difference of location, the neck being built up as an isthmus of
separation between the two. The thoracic soul, the seat of courage, was
placed nearer to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>head,
 in order that it might be the medium for transmitting influence from
the cranial soul above, to the abdominal soul below; which last was at
once the least worthy and the most difficult to control. The heart,
being the initial point of the veins, received the orders and
inspirations of the cranial soul, transmitting them onward through its
many blood-channels to all the sensitive parts of the body; which were
thus rendered obedient, as far as possible, to the authority of man’s
rational nature.<a name="FnAnchor12_3" href="#Footnote12_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The unity or communication of the three souls was kept up through the continuity of the cerebro-spinal column.</p>

<p>
But, though by these arrangements the higher soul in the cranium was
enabled to control to a certain extent its inferior allies, it was
itself much disturbed and contaminated by their reaction. The violence
of passion and appetite, the constant processes of nutrition and
sensation pervading the whole body, the multifarious movements of the
limbs and trunk, in all varieties of direction, — these causes all
contributed to agitate and to confuse the rotations of the cranial soul,
 perverting the arithmetical proportions and harmony belonging to them.
The circles of Same and Diverse were made to convey false information;
and the soul, for some time after its first junction with the body,
became destitute of intelligence.<a name="FnAnchor12_4" href="#Footnote12_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
 In mature life, indeed, the violence of the disturbing causes abates,
and the man may become more and more intelligent, especially if placed
under appropriate training and education. But in many cases no such
improvement took place, and the rational soul of man was irrecoverably
spoiled; so that new and worse breeds were formed, by successive steps
of degeneracy. The first stage, and the least amount of degeneracy, was
exhibited in the formation of woman; the original type of man not having
 included diversity of sex. By farther steps of degradation, in
different ways, the inferior animals were formed — birds, quadrupeds,
and fishes.<a name="FnAnchor12_5" href="#Footnote12_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 In each of these, the rational soul became weaker and worse; its
circular rotations ceased with the disappearance of the spherical
cranium, and animal appetites with sensational agitations were left
without control. As man, with his two emotional souls and body joined on
 to the rational soul and cranium, was a debased copy of the perfect
rational soul and <span class="correction" title="amended from 'sperical'">spherical</span>
 body of the divine Kosmos, so the other inhabitants of the Kosmos
proceeded from still farther debasement and disrationalization of the
original type of man.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>Such
is the view of Psychology given by Plato in the Timæus; beginning with
the divine Kosmos, and passing downwards from thence to the triple soul
of man, as well as to the various still lower successors of degenerated
man. It is to be remarked that Plato, though he puts soul as prior to
body in dignity and power, and as having for its functions to control
and move body, yet always conceives soul as attached to body, and never
as altogether detached, not even in the divine Kosmos. The soul, in
Plato’s view, is self-moving and self-moved: it is both <i>Primum Mobile</i> in itself, and <i>Primum Movens</i> as to the body; it has itself the corporeal properties of being extended and moved, and it has body implicated with it besides.</p>
<p>
The theory above described, in so far as it attributes to the soul rational constituent elements (<i>Idem</i>, <i>Diversum</i>),
 continuous magnitude, and circular rotations, was peculiar to Plato,
and is criticized by Aristotle as the peculiarity of his master.<a name="FnAnchor12_6" href="#Footnote12_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 But several other philosophers agreed with Plato in considering
self-motion, together with motive causality and faculties perceptive and
 cognitive, to be essential characteristics of soul. Alkmæon declared
the soul to be in perpetual motion, like all the celestial bodies; hence
 it was also immortal, as they were.<a name="FnAnchor12_7" href="#Footnote12_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 Herakleitus described it as the subtlest of elements, and as
perpetually fluent; hence it was enabled to know other things, all of
which were in flux and change. Diogenes of Apollonia affirmed that the
element constituent of soul was air, at once mobile, all-penetrating,
and intelligent. Demokritus declared that among the infinite diversity
of atoms those of spherical figure were the constituents both of the
element fire and of the soul: the spherical atoms were by reason of
their figure the most apt and rapid in moving; it was their nature never
 to be at rest, and they imparted motion to everything else.<a name="FnAnchor12_8" href="#Footnote12_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
 Anaxagoras affirmed soul to be radically and essentially distinct from
every thing else, but to be the great primary source of motion, and to
be endued with cognitive power, though at the same time not suffering
impressions from without.<a name="FnAnchor12_9" href="#Footnote12_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 Empedokles considered soul to be a compound of the four elements —
fire, water, air, earth; with love and hatred as principles of motion,
the former producing aggregation of elements, the latter, disgregation:
by means of each element the soul became cognizant of the like element
in the Kosmos. Some Pythagoreans looked <span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>upon
 the soul as an aggregate of particles of extreme subtlety, which
pervaded the air and were in perpetual agitation. Other Pythagoreans,
however, declared it to be an harmonious or proportional mixture of
contrary elements and qualities; hence its universality of cognition,
extending to all.<a name="FnAnchor12_10" href="#Footnote12_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>
A peculiar theory was delivered by Xenokrates (who, having been
fellow-pupil with Aristotle under Plato, afterwards conducted the
Platonic School, during all the time that Aristotle taught at the
Lykeium), which Aristotle declares to involve greater difficulty than
any of the others. Xenokrates described the soul as “a number (a monad
or indivisible unit) moving itself.”<a name="FnAnchor12_11" href="#Footnote12_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 He retained the self-moving property which Plato had declared to be
characteristic of the soul, while he departed from Plato’s doctrine of a
 soul with continuous extension. He thus fell back upon the Pythagorean
idea of number as the fundamental essence. Aristotle impugns, as alike
untenable, both the two properties here alleged — number and
self-motion. If the monad both moves and is moved (he argues), it cannot
 be indivisible; if it be moved, it must have position, or must be a
point; but the motion of a point is a line, without any of that variety
that constitutes life. How can the soul be a monad? or, if it be, what
difference can exist between one soul and another, since monads cannot
differ from each other except in position? How comes it that some bodies
 have souls and others not? and how, upon this theory, can we explain
the fact that many animated bodies, both plants and animals, will remain
 alive after being divided, the monadic soul thus exhibiting itself as
many and diverse? Besides, the monad set up by Xenokrates is hardly
distinguishable from the highly attenuated body or spherical atom
recognized by Demokritus as the origin or beginning of bodily motion.<a name="FnAnchor12_12" href="#Footnote12_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>
<p>

<p>
These and other arguments are employed by Aristotle to refute the theory
 of Xenokrates. In fact, he rejects all the theories then current. After
 having dismissed the self-motor doctrine, he proceeds to impugn the
views of those who declared the soul to be a compound of all the four
elements, in order that they might account for its percipient and
cognitive faculties upon the maxim then very generally admitted<a name="FnAnchor12_13" href="#Footnote12_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
 — That like is perceived and known by like. This theory, the principal
champion of which was Empedokles, appears to Aristotle inadmissible. You
 say (he remarks) that like knows like; how <span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>does
 this consist with your other doctrine, that like cannot act upon, or
suffer from, like, especially as you consider that both in perception
and in cognition the percipient and cognizant suffers or is acted upon?<a name="FnAnchor12_14" href="#Footnote12_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
 Various parts of the cognizant subject, such as bone, hair, ligaments,
&amp;c., are destitute of perception and cognition; how then can we know
 anything about bone, hair, and ligaments, since we cannot know them by
like?<a name="FnAnchor12_15" href="#Footnote12_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 Suppose the soul to be compounded of all the four elements; this may
explain how it comes to know the four elements, themselves, but not how
it comes to know all the combinations of the four; now innumerable
combinations of the four are comprised among the <i>cognita</i>. We must
 assume that the soul contains in itself not merely the four elements,
but also the laws or definite proportions wherein they can combine; and
this is affirmed by no one.<a name="FnAnchor12_16" href="#Footnote12_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Moreover, <i>Ens</i> is an equivocal, or at least a multivocal, term; there are <i>Entia</i>
 belonging to each of the ten Categories. Now the soul cannot include in
 itself all the ten, for the different Categories have no elements in
common; in whichever Category you rank the soul, it will know (by virtue
 of likeness) the <i>cognita</i> belonging to that category, but it will not know the <i>cognita</i> belonging to the other nine.<a name="FnAnchor12_17" href="#Footnote12_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 Besides, even if we grant that the soul includes all the four elements,
 where is the cementing principle that combines all the four into one?
The elements are merely matter; and what holds them together must be the
 really potent principle of soul; but of this no explanation is given.<a name="FnAnchor12_18" href="#Footnote12_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>

<p>
Some philosophers have assumed (continues Aristotle) that soul pervades
the whole Kosmos and its elements; and that it is inhaled by animals in
respiration along with the air.<a name="FnAnchor12_19" href="#Footnote12_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 They forget that all plants, and even some animals, live without
respiring at all; moreover, upon this theory, air and fire also, as
possessing soul, and what is said to be a better soul, ought (if the
phrase were permitted) to be regarded as animals. The soul of air or
fire must be homogeneous in its parts; the souls of animals are not
homogeneous, but involve several distinct parts or functions.<a name="FnAnchor12_20" href="#Footnote12_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
 The soul perceives, cogitates, opines, feels, desires, repudiates;
farther, it moves the body locally, and brings about the growth and
decay of the body. Here we have a new mystery:<a name="FnAnchor12_21" href="#Footnote12_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> — Is the whole soul engaged in the performance <span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>of
 each of these functions, or has it a separate part exclusively
consecrated to each? If so, how many are the parts? Some philosophers
(Plato among them) declare the soul to be divided, and that one part
cogitates and cognizes, while another part desires. But upon that
supposition what is it that holds these different parts together?
Certainly not the body (which is Plato’s theory); on the contrary, it is
 the soul that holds together the body; for, as soon as the soul is
gone, the body rots and disappears.<a name="FnAnchor12_22" href="#Footnote12_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
 If there be anything that keeps together the divers parts of the soul
as one, that something must be the true and fundamental soul; and we
ought not to speak of the soul as having parts, but as essentially one
and indivisible, with several distinct faculties. Again, if we are to
admit parts of the soul, does each part hold together a special part of
the body, as the entire soul holds together the entire body? This seems
impossible; for what part of the body can the Noûs or Intellect (<i>e.g.</i>)
 be imagined to hold together? And, besides, several kinds of plants and
 of animals may be divided, yet so that each of the separate parts shall
 still continue to live; hence it is plain that the soul in each
separate part is complete and homogeneous.<a name="FnAnchor12_23" href="#Footnote12_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a></p>

<p>
Aristotle thus rejects all the theories proposed by antecedent
philosophers, but more especially the two following:—That the soul
derives its cognitive powers from the fact of being compounded of the
four elements; That the soul is self-moved. He pronounces it incorrect
to say that the soul is moved at all.<a name="FnAnchor12_24" href="#Footnote12_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 He farther observes that none of the philosophers have kept in view
either the full meaning or all the varieties of soul; and that none of
these defective theories suffices for the purpose that every good and
sufficient theory ought to serve, viz., not merely to define the essence
 of the soul, but also to define it in such a manner that the
concomitant functions and affections of the soul shall all be deducible
from it.<a name="FnAnchor12_25" href="#Footnote12_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
 Lastly, he points out that most of his predecessors had considered that
 the prominent characteristics of soul were — to be motive and to be

Aristotle requires that a good theory of the soul shall explain alike
the lowest vegetable soul, and the highest functions of the human or
divine soul. And, in commenting on those theorists who declared that the
 essence of soul consisted in movement, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>remarks
 that their theory fails altogether in regard to the Noûs (or cogitative
 and intellective faculty of the human soul); the operation of which
bears far greater analogy to rest or suspension of movement than to
movement itself.<a name="FnAnchor12_27" href="#Footnote12_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

We shall now proceed to state how Aristotle steers clear (or at least
believes himself to steer clear) of the defects that he has pointed out
in the psychological theories of his predecessors. Instead of going back
 (like Empedokles, Plato, and others) to a time when the Kosmos did not
yet exist, and giving us an hypothesis to explain how its parts came
together or were put together, he takes the facts and objects of the
Kosmos as they stand, and distributes them according to distinctive
marks alike obvious, fundamental, and pervading; after which he seeks a
mode of explanation in the principles of his own First Philosophy or
Ontology. Whoever had studied the Organon and the Physica of Aristotle
(apparently intended to be read prior to the treatise De Animâ) would be
 familiar with his distribution of <i>Entia</i> into ten Categories, of which Essence or Substance was the first and the fundamental. Of these Essences or Substances the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'most most'">most</span>
 complete and recognized were physical or natural bodies; and among such
 bodies one of the most striking distinctions, was between those that
had life and those that had it not. By life, Aristotle means keeping up
the processes of nutrition, growth, and decay.<a name="FnAnchor12_28" href="#Footnote12_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a></p>

“To live” (Aristotle observes) is a term used in several different
meanings; whatever possesses any one of the following four properties is
 said to live:<a name="FnAnchor12_29" href="#Footnote12_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
 (1) Intellect, (2) Sensible perception, (3) Local movement and rest,
(4) Internal movement of nutrition, growth, and decay. But of these four
 the last is the only one common to all living bodies without exception;
 it is the foundation presupposed by the other three. It is the only one
 possessed by plants,<a name="FnAnchor12_30" href="#Footnote12_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> and common to all plants as well as to all animals — to all animated bodies.</p>

<p>
What is the animating principle belonging to each of these bodies, and
what is the most general definition of it? Such is the problem that
Aristotle states to himself about the soul.<a name="FnAnchor12_31" href="#Footnote12_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> He explains it by a metaphysical distinction first introduced (apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>) by himself into <i>Philosophia Prima</i>.
 He considers Substance or Essence as an ideal compound; not simply as
clothed with all the accidents described in the nine last Categories,
but also as being analysable in itself, even apart from these accidents,
 into two abstract, logical, or notional elements or <i>principia</i> —
Form and Matter. This distinction is borrowed from the most familiar
facts of the sensible world — the shape of solid objects. When we see or
 feel a cube of wax, we distinguish the cubic shape from the waxen
material;<a name="FnAnchor12_32" href="#Footnote12_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
 we may find the like shape in many other materials — wood, stone,
&amp;c.; we may find the like material in many different shapes —
sphere, pyramid, &amp;c.; but the matter has always some shape, and the
shape has always some matter. We can name and reason about the matter,
without attending to the shape, or distinguishing whether it be cube or
sphere; we can name and reason about the shape, without attending to the
 material shaped, or to any of its various peculiarities. But this,
though highly useful, is a mere abstraction or notional distinction.
There can be no real separation between the two: no shape without some
solid material; no solid material without some shape. The two are
correlates; each of them implying the other, and neither of them
admitting of being realized or actualized without the other.</p>

<p>
This distinction of Form and Matter is one of the capital features of Aristotle’s <i>Philosophia Prima</i>.
 He expands it and diversifies it in a thousand ways, often with
subtleties very difficult to follow; but the fundamental import of it is
 seldom lost — two correlates inseparably implicated in fact and reality
 in every concrete individual that has received a substantive name, yet
logically separable and capable of being named and considered apart from
 each other. The Aristotelian analysis thus brings out, in regard to
each individual substance (or <i>Hoc Aliquid</i>, to use his phrase), a
triple point of view: (1) The Form; (2) The Matter; (3) The compound or
aggregate of the two — in other words, the inseparable <i>Ens</i>, which carries us out of the domain of logic or abstraction into that of the concrete or reality.<a name="FnAnchor12_33" href="#Footnote12_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote12_33" id="Footnote12_33"></a><a href="#FnAnchor12_33">33</a></span> Aristot. Metaphys. <span class="smcap">Z.</span> iii. p. 1029, a. 1-34; De Animâ, II. i. p. 412, a. 6; p. 414, a. 15.</p>
<p>
In the first book of the Physica, Aristotle pushes this analysis yet further, introducing three <i>principia</i>
 instead of two:—(1 ) Form, (2) Matter, (3) Privation (of Form); he
gives a distinct general name to the negation as well as to the
affirmation; he provides a sign <i>minus</i> as counter-denomination to the sign <i>plus</i>.
 But he intimates that this is only the same analysis more minutely
discriminated, or in a different point of view: &#948;&#953;&#8056; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#948;&#973;&#959;

<p>
<i>Materia Prima</i> (Aristotle says, Phys. I. vii. p. 191, a. 8) is “knowable only by analogy” — <i>i.e.</i>,
 explicable only by illustrative examples: as the brass is to the
statue, as the wood is to the couch, &amp;c.; natural substances being
explained from works of art, as is frequent with Aristotle.</p></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span>Aristotle
 farther recognizes, between these two logical correlates, a marked
difference of rank. The Form stands first, the Matter second, — not in
time, but in notional presentation. The Form is higher, grander, prior
in dignity and esteem, more <i>Ens</i>, or more nearly approaching to
perfect entity; the Matter is lower, meaner, posterior in dignity,
farther removed from that perfection. The conception of wax, plaster,
wood, &amp;c., without amy definite or determinate shape, is confused
and unimpressive; but a name, connoting some definite shape, at once
removes this confusion, and carries with it mental pre-eminence, alike
as to phantasy, memory, and science. In the logical hierarchy of
Aristotle, Matter is the inferior and Form the superior;<a name="FnAnchor12_34" href="#Footnote12_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a>
 yet neither of the two can escape from its relative character: Form
requires Matter for its correlate, and is nothing in itself or apart,<a name="FnAnchor12_35" href="#Footnote12_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a>
 just as much as Matter requires Form; though from the inferior dignity
of Matter we find it more frequently described as the second or
correlate, while Form is made to stand forward as the <i>relatum</i>.
For complete reality, we want the concrete individual having the
implication of both; while, in regard to each of the constituents <i>per se</i>, no separate real existence can be affirmed, but only a nominal or logical separation.</p>

<p>
This difference of rank between Matter and Form — that the first is
inferior and the last the superior — is sometimes so much put in the
foreground, that the two are conceived in a different manner and under
other names, as Potential and Actual. Matter is the potential,
imperfect, inchoate, which the supervening Form actualizes into the
perfect and complete; a transition from half-reality to entire reality
or act. The Potential is the undefined or indeterminate<a name="FnAnchor12_36" href="#Footnote12_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> — what may be or may not be — <span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span>what
 is not yet actual, and may perhaps never become so, but is prepared to
pass into actuality when the energizing principle comes to aid. In this
way of putting the antithesis, the Potential is not so much implicated
with the Actual as merged and suppressed to make room for the Actual: it
 is as a half-grown passing into a full-grown; being itself essential as
 a preliminary stage in the order of logical generation.<a name="FnAnchor12_37" href="#Footnote12_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a>
 The three logical divisions — Matter, Form, and the resulting Compound
or Concrete (&#964;&#8056; &#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;, &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957;), are here compressed into two
 — the Potential and the Actualization thereof. Actuality (&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;,
&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;) coincides in meaning partly with the Form, partly with the
resulting Compound; the Form being so much exalted, that the distinction
 between the two is almost effaced.<a name="FnAnchor12_38" href="#Footnote12_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>

 viii. p. 1050, b. 10. He says, p. 1048, a. 35, that this distinction
between Potential and Actual cannot be defined, but can only be
illustrated by particular examples, several of which he proceeds to
enumerate. Trendelenburg observes (Note <span class="correction" title="amended from 'ad.'">ad</span>. Aristot. De Animâ, p.
307):—“&#916;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; contraria adhuc in se inclusa tenet, ut in utrumque abire
 possit: &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; alterum excludit.” Compare also ib. p. 302. This <i>May or May not be</i>
 is the widest and most general sense of the terms &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; and &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;,
common to all the analogical or derivative applications that Aristotle
points out as belonging to them. It is more general than that which he
gives as the &#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8005;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#962; — &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7952;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#8179; &#7970;

Two things are to be remembered respecting Matter, in its Aristotelian
(logical or ontological) sense: (1) It may be Body, but it is not
necessarily Body;<a name="FnAnchor12_39" href="#Footnote12_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> (2) It is only intelligible as the correlate of Form: it can neither exist by itself, nor can it be known by itself (<i>i.e.</i>,
 when taken out of that relativity). This deserves notice, because to
forget the relativity of a relative word, and to reason upon it as if it
 were an absolute, is an oversight not unfrequent. Furthermore, each
variety of Matter has its appropriate Form, and each variety of Form its
 appropriate Matter, with which it correlates. There are various stages
or gradations of Matter; from <i>Materia Prima</i>, which has no Form <span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>at all, passing upwards through successive partial developments to <i>Materia Ultima</i>; which last is hardly<a name="FnAnchor12_40" href="#Footnote12_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> distinguishable from Form or from <i>Materia Formata</i>.</p>

The distinction above specified is employed by Aristotle in his
exposition of the Soul. The soul belongs to the Category of Substance or
 Essence (not to that of Quantity, Quality, &amp;c.); but of the two
points of view under which Essence may be presented, the soul ranks with
 Form, not with Matter — with the Actual, not with the Potential. The
Matter to which (as correlate) soul stands related, is a natural body (<i>i.e.</i>,
 a body having within it an inherent principle of motion and rest)
organized in a certain way, or fitted out with certain capacities and
preparations to which soul is the active and indispensable complement.
These capacities would never come into actuality without the soul; but,
on the other hand, the range of actualities or functions in the soul
depends upon, and is limited by, the range of capacities ready prepared
for it in the body. The implication of the two constitutes the living
subject, with all its functions, active and passive. If the eye were an
animated or living subject, seeing would be its soul; if the carpenter’s
 axe were living, cutting would be its soul;<a name="FnAnchor12_41" href="#Footnote12_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a>
 the matter would be the lens or the iron in which this soul is
embodied. It is not indispensable, however, that all the functions of
the living subject should be at all times in complete exercise: the
subject is still living, even while asleep; the eye is still a good eye,
 though at the moment closed. It is enough if the functional aptitude
exist as a dormant property, ready to rise into activity, when the
proper occasions present themselves. This minimum of Form suffices to
give living efficacy to the potentialities of body; it is enough that a
man, though now in a dark night and seeing nothing, will see as soon as
the sun rises; or that he knows geometry, though he is not now thinking
of a geometrical problem. This dormant possession is what Aristotle
calls the First Entelechy or Energy, <i>i.e.</i>, the lowest stage of
Actuality, or the minimum of influence required to transform
Potentiality into Actuality. The Aristotelian definition of Soul is
thus: The first <span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>entelechy of a natural organized body, having life in potentiality.<a name="FnAnchor12_42" href="#Footnote12_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a>
 This is all that is essential to the soul; the second or higher
entelechy (actual exercise of the faculties) is not a constant or
universal property.<a name="FnAnchor12_43" href="#Footnote12_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a></p>

 Aristot. De Animâ, II. ii. p. 414, a. 8-18. The distinction here taken
between the first or lower stage of Entelechy, and the second or higher
stage, coincides substantially with the distinction in the Nikomachean

<p>
In this definition of Soul, Aristotle employs his own <i>Philosophia Prima</i>
 to escape the errors committed by prior philosophers. He does not admit
 that the soul is a separate entity in itself; or that it is composed
(as Empedokles and Demokritus had said) of corporeal elements, or (as
Plato had said) of elements partly corporeal, partly logical and
notional. He rejects the imaginary virtues of number, invoked by the
Pythagoreans and Xenokrates; lastly, he keeps before him not merely man,
 but all the varieties of animated objects, to which his definition must
 be adapted. His first capital point is to put aside the alleged
identity, or similarity, or sameness of elements, between soul and body;
 and to put aside equally any separate existence or substantiality of
soul. He effects both these purposes by defining them as essentially <i>relatum</i> and correlate; the soul, as the <i>relatum</i>, is unintelligible and unmeaning without its correlate, upon which accordingly its definition is declared to be founded.</p>
<p>
The real animated subject may be looked at either from the point of view of the <i>relatum</i>
 or from that of the correlate; but, though the two are thus logically
separable, in fact and reality they are inseparably implicated; and, if
either of them be withdrawn, the animated subject disappears. “The soul
(says Aristotle) is not any variety of body, but it cannot be without a
body; it is not a body, but it is something belonging to or related to a
 body; and for this reason it is in a body, and in a body of such or
such potentialities.”<a name="FnAnchor12_44" href="#Footnote12_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> Soul is to body (we thus read), not as a compound of like elements, nor as a type is to its copy, or <i>vice versâ</i>, but as a <i>relatum</i>
 to its correlate; dependent upon the body for all its acts and
manifestations, and bringing to consummation what in the body exists as
potentiality only. Soul, however, is better than body; and the animated
being is better than the inanimate by reason of its soul.<a name="FnAnchor12_45" href="#Footnote12_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>The animated subject is thus a form immersed or implicated in matter; and all its actions and passions are so likewise.<a name="FnAnchor12_46" href="#Footnote12_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a>
 Each of these has its formal side, as concerns the soul, and its
material side, as concerns the body. When a man or animal is angry, for
example, this emotion is both a fact of the soul and a fact of the body:
 in the first of these two characters, it may be defined as an appetite
for hurting some one who has hurt us; in the second of the two, it may
be defined as an ebullition of the blood and heat round the heart.<a name="FnAnchor12_47" href="#Footnote12_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
 The emotion, belonging to the animated subject or aggregate of soul and
 body, is a complex fact having two aspects, logically distinguishable
from each other, but each correlating and implying the other. This is
true not only in regard to our passions, emotions, and appetites, but
also in regard to our perceptions, phantasms, reminiscences, reasonings,
 efforts of attention in learning, &amp;c. We do not say that the soul
weaves or builds (Aristotle observes<a name="FnAnchor12_48" href="#Footnote12_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a>): we say that the animated subject, the aggregate of soul and body, <i>the man</i>,
 weaves or builds. So we ought also to say, not that the soul feels
anger, pity, love, hatred, &amp;c., or that the soul learns, reasons,
recollects, &amp;c., but that the man with his soul does these things.
The actual movement throughout these processes is not in the soul, but
in the body; sometimes going <i>to</i> the soul (as in sensible perception), sometimes proceeding <i>from</i>
 the soul to the body (as in the case of reminiscence). All these
processes are at once corporeal and psychical, pervading the whole
animated subject, and having two aspects coincident and inter-dependent,
 though logically distinguishable. The perfect or imperfect
discrimination by the sentient soul depends upon the good or bad
condition of the bodily sentient organs; an old man that has become
shortsighted would see as well as before, if he could regain his
youthful eye. The defects of the soul arise from defects in the bodily
organism to which it belongs, as in cases of drunkenness or sickness;
and this is not less true of the Noûs, or intellective soul, than of the
 sentient soul.<a name="FnAnchor12_49" href="#Footnote12_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
 Intelligence, as well as emotion, are phenomena, not of the bodily
organism simply, nor of the Noûs simply, but of the community or
partnership of which both are members; and, when intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
 gives way, this is not because the Noûs itself is impaired, but because
 the partnership is ruined by the failure of the bodily organism.</p>

<p>
Respecting the Noûs (the theorizing Noûs), we must here observe that
Aristotle treats it as a separate kind or variety of soul, with several
peculiarities. We shall collect presently all that he says upon that
subject, which is the most obscure portion of his psychology.</p>
<p>
In regard to soul generally, the relative point of view with body as the
 correlate is constantly insisted on by Aristotle; without such
correlate his assertions would have no meaning. But the relation between
 them is presented in several different ways. The soul is the cause and
principle of a living body;<a name="FnAnchor12_50" href="#Footnote12_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a>
 by which is meant, not an independent and pre-existent something that
brings the body into existence but, an immanent or indwelling influence
which sustains the unity and guides the functions of the organism.
According to the quadruple classification of Cause recognized by
Aristotle — Formal, Material, Movent, and Final — the body furnishes the
 Material Cause, while the soul comprises all the three others. The soul
 is (as we have already seen) the Form in relation to the body as
Matter, but it is, besides, the Movent, inasmuch as it determines the
local displacement as well as all the active functions of the body —
nutrition, growth, generation, sensation, &amp;c.; lastly, it is also
the Final Cause, since the maintenance and perpetuation of the same
Form, in successive individuals, is the standing purpose aimed at by
each body in the economy of Nature.<a name="FnAnchor12_51" href="#Footnote12_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
 Under this diversity of aspect, soul and body are reciprocally
integrant and complementary of each other, the real integer (the Living
or Animated Body) including both.</p>

<p>
Soul, in the Aristotelian point of view — what is common to all living
bodies, comprises several varieties. But these varieties are not
represented as forming a genus with co-ordinate species under it, in
such manner that the counter-ordinate species, reciprocally excluding
each other, are, when taken together, co-extensive with the whole genus;
 like man and brute in regard to animal. The varieties of soul are
distributed into successive stages gradually narrowing in extension and
enlarging in comprehension; the first or lowest stage being co-extensive
 with the whole, but connoting only two or three simple attributes; the
second, or next above, connoting all these and more besides, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>denoting
 only part of the individuals denoted by the first; the third connoting
all this and more, but denoting yet fewer individuals; and so on
forward. Thus the concrete individuals, called living bodies, include
all plants as well as all animals; but the soul, called Nutritive by
Aristotle, corresponding thereto connotes only nutrition, growth, decay,
 and generation of another similar individual.<a name="FnAnchor12_52" href="#Footnote12_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
 In the second stage, plants are left out, but all animals remain: the
Sentient soul, belonging to animals, but not belonging to any plants,
connotes all the functions and unities of the Nutritive soul, together
with sensible perception (at least in its rudest shape) besides.<a name="FnAnchor12_53" href="#Footnote12_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a>
 We proceed onward in the same direction, taking in additional faculties —
 the Movent, Appetitive, Phantastic (Imaginative), Noëtic (Intelligent)
soul, and thus diminishing the total of individuals denoted. But each
higher variety of soul continues to possess all the faculties of the
lower. Thus the Sentient soul cannot exist without comprehending all the
 faculties of the Nutritive, though the Nutritive exists (in plants)
without any admixture of the Sentient. Again, the Sentient soul does not
 necessarily possess either memory, imagination, or intellect (Noûs);
but no soul can be either Imaginative or Noëtic, without being Sentient
as well as Nutritive. The Noëtic Soul, as the highest of all, retains in
 itself all the lower faculties; but these are found to exist apart from
 it.<a name="FnAnchor12_54" href="#Footnote12_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote12_52" id="Footnote12_52"></a><a href="#FnAnchor12_52">52</a></span>
 In the Aristotelian treatise De Plantis, p. 815, b. 16, it is stated
that Empedokles, Anaxagoras, and Demokritus, all affirmed that plants
had both intellect and cognition up to a certain moderate point. We do
not cite this treatise as the composition of Aristotle, but it is
reasonably good evidence in reference to the doctrine of those other
philosophers.</p></div>

<p>
We may remark here that the psychological classification of Aristotle
proceeds in the inverse direction to that of Plato. In the Platonic
Timæus we begin with the grand soul of the Kosmos, and are conducted by
successive steps of degradation to men, animals, plants; while Aristotle
 lays his foundation in the largest, most multiplied, and lowest range
of individuals, carrying us by successive increase of conditions to the
fewer and the higher.</p>
<p>
The lowest or Nutritive soul, in spite of the small number of conditions
 involved in it, is the indispensable basis whereon all the others
depend. None of the other souls can exist apart from it.<a name="FnAnchor12_55" href="#Footnote12_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> It is the first constituent of the living individual — the implication of Form with Matter in a natural body suitably <span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>organized;
 it is the preservative of the life of the individual, with its
aggregate of functions and faculties, and with the proper limits of size
 and shape that characterize the species;<a name="FnAnchor12_56" href="#Footnote12_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a>
 it is, moreover, the preservative of perpetuity to the species,
inasmuch as it prompts and enables each individual to generate and leave
 behind a successor like himself; which is the only way that an
individual can obtain quasi-immortality, though all aspire to become
immortal.<a name="FnAnchor12_57" href="#Footnote12_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
 This lowest soul is the primary cause of digestion and nutrition. It is
 cognate with the celestial heat, which is essential also as a
co-operative cause; accordingly, all animated bodies possess an inherent
 natural heat.<a name="FnAnchor12_58" href="#Footnote12_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a></p>

<p>
We advance upwards now from the nutritive soul to that higher soul which
 is at once nutritive and Sentient; for Aristotle does not follow the
example of Plato in recognizing three souls to one body, but assigns
only one and the same soul, though with multiplied faculties and
functions, to one and the same body. Sensible perception, with its
accompaniments, forms the characteristic privilege of the animal as
contrasted with the plant.<a name="FnAnchor12_59" href="#Footnote12_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
 Sensible perception admits of many diversities, from the simplest and
rudest tactile sensation, which even the lowest animals cannot be
without, to the full equipment of five senses which Aristotle declares
to be a maximum not susceptible of increase.<a name="FnAnchor12_60" href="#Footnote12_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a>
 But the sentient faculty, even in its lowest stage, indicates a
remarkable exaltation of the soul in its character of form. The soul, <i>quâ</i> sentient and percipient, receives the form of the <i>perceptum</i>
 without the matter; whereas the nutritive soul cannot disconnect the
two, but receives and appropriates the nutrient substance, form and
matter in one and combined.<a name="FnAnchor12_61" href="#Footnote12_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
 Aristotle illustrates this characteristic feature of sensible
perception by recurring to his former example of the wax and the figure.
 Just as wax receives from a signet the impression engraven thereon,
whether the matter of the signet be iron, gold, stone, or wood; as the
impression stamped has no regard to the matter, but reproduces only the
figure engraven on the signet, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>the wax being merely potential and undefined, until the signet comes to convert it into something actual and definite;<a name="FnAnchor12_62" href="#Footnote12_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a>
 so the percipient faculty in man is impressed by the substances in
nature, not according to the matter of each but, according to the
qualitative form of each. Such passive receptivity is the first and
lowest form of sensation,<a name="FnAnchor12_63" href="#Footnote12_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
 not having any magnitude in itself, but residing in bodily organs which
 have magnitude, and separable from them only by logical abstraction. It
 is a potentiality, correlating with, and in due proportion to, the
exterior <i>percipibile</i>, which, when acting upon it, brings it into full actuality. The actuality of both (<i>percipiens</i> and <i>perceptum</i>) is one and the same, and cannot be disjoined in fact, though the potentialities of the two are distinct yet correlative; the <i>percipiens</i> is not like the <i>percipibile</i> originally, but becomes like it by being thus actualized.<a name="FnAnchor12_64" href="#Footnote12_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a></p>

<p>
There were conflicting doctrines current in Aristotle’s time: some said that, for an agent to act upon a patient, there must be <i>likeness</i> between the two; others said that there must be <i>unlikeness</i>. Aristotle dissents from both, and adopts a sort of intermediate doctrine.</p></div>
<p>
The sentient soul is communicated by the male parent in the act of generation,<a name="FnAnchor12_65" href="#Footnote12_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a>
 and is complete from the moment of birth, not requiring a process of
teaching after birth; the sentient subject becomes at once and
instantly, in regard to sense, on a level with one that has attained a
certain actuality of cognition, but is not at the moment reflecting upon
 the <i>cognitum</i>. Potentiality and Actuality are in fact
distinguishable into lower and higher degrees; the Potential that has
been actualized in a first or lower stage, is still a Potential
relatively to higher stages of Actuality.<a name="FnAnchor12_66" href="#Footnote12_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
 The Potential may be acted upon in two opposite ways; either by
deadening and extinguishing it, or by developing and carrying it forward
 to realization. The sentient soul, when asleep or inert, requires a
cause to stimulate it into actual seeing or hearing; the noëtic or
cognizant soul, under like circumstances, must also be stimulated into
actual meditation on its <i>cognitum</i>. But there is this difference between the two. The sentient soul communes with particulars; the noëtic soul with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>universals.
 The sentient soul derives its stimulus from without, and from some of
the individual objects, tangible, visible, or audible; but the noëtic
soul is put into action by the abstract and universal, which is in a
certain sense <i>within</i> the soul itself; so that a man can at any
time meditate on what he pleases, but he cannot see or hear what he
pleases, or anything except such visible or audible objects as are at
hand.<a name="FnAnchor12_67" href="#Footnote12_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a></p>

<p>
We have already remarked, that in many animals the sentient soul is
little developed; being confined in some to the sense of touch (which
can never be wanting),<a name="FnAnchor12_68" href="#Footnote12_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
 and in others to touch and taste. But even this minimum of sense —
though small, if compared with the variety of senses in man — is a
prodigious step in advance of plants; it comprises a certain cognition,
and within its own sphere it is always critical, comparing,
discriminative.<a name="FnAnchor12_69" href="#Footnote12_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>
 The sentient soul possesses this discriminative faculty in common with
the noëtic soul or Intelligence, though applied to different objects and
 purposes; and possesses such faculty, because it is itself a mean or
middle term between the two sensible extremes of which it takes
cognizance, — hot and cold, hard and soft, wet and dry, white and black,
 acute and grave, bitter and sweet, light and darkness, visible and
invisible, tangible and intangible, &amp;c. We feel no sensation at all
when the object touched is exactly of the same temperature with
ourselves, neither hotter nor colder; the sentient soul, being a mean
between the two extremes, is stimulated to assimilate itself for the
time to either of them, according as it is acted upon from without. It
thus makes comparison of each with the other, and of both with its own
mean.<a name="FnAnchor12_70" href="#Footnote12_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a>
 Lastly, the sentient faculty in the soul is really one and indivisible,
 though distinguishable logically or by abstraction into different
genera and species.<a name="FnAnchor12_71" href="#Footnote12_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
 Of that faculty the central physical organ is the heart, which contains
 the congenital or animal spirit. The Aristotelian psychology is here
remarkable, affirming as it does the essential relativity of all <span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>phenomena
 of sense to the appreciative condition of the sentient; as well as the
constant implication of intellectual and discriminative comparison among
 them.</p>

All the objects generating sensible perception, are magnitudes.<a name="FnAnchor12_72" href="#Footnote12_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
 Some perceptions are peculiar to one sense alone, as colour to the eye,
 &amp;c. Upon these we never make mistakes directly; in other words, we
always judge rightly what is the colour or what is the sound, though we
are often deceived in judging what the thing coloured is, or where the
sonorous object is.<a name="FnAnchor12_73" href="#Footnote12_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a>
 There are, however, some perceivables not peculiar to any one sense
alone, but appreciable by two or more; though chiefly and best by the
sense of vision; such are motion, rest, number, figure, magnitude. Here
the appreciation becomes less accurate, yet it is still made directly by
 sense.<a name="FnAnchor12_74" href="#Footnote12_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a>
 But there are yet other matters that, though not directly affecting
sense, are perceived indirectly, or by way of accompaniment to what is
directly perceived. Thus we see a white object; nothing else affecting
our sense <span class="correction" title="amended from 'accept'">except</span>
 its whiteness. Beyond this, however, we judge and declare, that the
object so seen is the son of Kleon. This is a judgment obtained
indirectly, or by way of accompaniment; by <i>accident</i>, so to speak, inasmuch as the same does not accompany all sensations of white. It is here that we are most liable to error.<a name="FnAnchor12_75" href="#Footnote12_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a></p>

<p>
Among the five senses, Aristotle distinguishes two as operating by
direct contact between subject and object (touch, taste); three as
operating through an external intervening medium (vision, smell, taste).
 He begins with Vision, which he regards as possessing most completely
the nature and characteristics of a sense.<a name="FnAnchor12_76" href="#Footnote12_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a>
 The direct and proper object of vision is colour. Now colour operates
upon the eye not immediately (for, if the coloured object be placed in
contact with the eye, there will be no vision), but by causing movements
 or perturbations in the external intervening medium, air or water,
which affect the sense through an appropriate agency of their own.<a name="FnAnchor12_77" href="#Footnote12_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>agency
 is, according to Aristotle, the Diaphanous or Transparent. When actual
or in energy, the transparent is called light; when potential or in
capacity only, it is called darkness. The eye is of watery structure,
apt for receiving these impressions.<a name="FnAnchor12_78" href="#Footnote12_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a>
 It is the presence either of fire, or of something analogous to the
celestial body, that calls forth the diaphanous from the state of
potentiality into that of actuality or light; in which latter condition
it is stimulated by colour. The diaphanous, whether as light or as
darkness, is a peculiar nature or accompaniment, not substantive in
itself, but inherent chiefly in the First or Celestial Body, yet also in
 air, water, glass, precious stones, and in all bodies to a greater or
less degree.<a name="FnAnchor12_79" href="#Footnote12_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>
 The diaphanous passes at once and simultaneously, in one place as well
as in another, from potentiality to actuality — from darkness to light.
Light does not take time to travel from one place to another, as sound
and smell do.<a name="FnAnchor12_80" href="#Footnote12_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a>
 The diaphanous is not a body, nor effluvium from a body, nor any one of
 the elements: it is of an adjective character — a certain agency or
attribute pervading or belonging to bodies, along with their extension.<a name="FnAnchor12_81" href="#Footnote12_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a> Colour marks and defines the surface of the body <i>quâ</i> diaphanous, as figure defines it <i>quâ</i>
 extended. Colour makes the diaphanous itself visible, and its own
varieties visible through the diaphanous. Air and water are transparent
throughout, though with an ill-defined superficial colour. White and
black, as colours in solid bodies, correspond to the condition of light
or darkness in air. There are some luminous objects visible in the dark,
 as fire, fungous matter, eyes, and scales of fish, &amp;c., though they
 have no appropriate colour.<a name="FnAnchor12_82" href="#Footnote12_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> There are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>seven
 species or varieties of colours, but all of them proceed from white and
 black, blended in different proportions, or seen one through another;
white and black are the two extremes, the other varieties being
intermediate between them.</p>

The same necessity for an intervening medium external to the subject, as
 in the case of vision, prevails also in the senses of hearing and
smell. If the audible or odorous object be placed in contact with its
organ of sense, there will be no hearing or smell. Whenever we hear or
smell any object, there must be interposed between us and the object a
suitable medium that shall be affected first; while the organ of sense
will be affected secondarily through that medium. Air is the medium in
regard to sound, both air and water in regard to smell; but there seems
besides (analogous to the transparent in regard to vision) a special
agency called the Trans-Sonant, which pervades air and enables it to
transmit sound; and certainly another special agency called the
Trans-Olfacient, which pervades both air and water, and enables them to
transmit smell.<a name="FnAnchor12_83" href="#Footnote12_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a>
 (It seems thus that something like a luminiferous ether — extended,
mobile, and permeating bodies, yet still incorporeal in itself — was an
hypothesis as old as Aristotle; and one other ether besides, analogous
in property and purpose — an odoriferous ether; perhaps a third or
soniferous ether, but this is less distinctly specified by Aristotle.)</p>

Spengel. Of the three names, &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#941;&#962; — &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#951;&#967;&#941;&#962; — &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957;, the
last two are not distinctly stated by Aristotle, but are said to have
been first applied by Theophrastus after him. See the notes of
Trendelenburg and Torstrick; the latter supposes Themistius to have had
before him a fuller and better text of Aristotle than that which we now
possess, which seems corrupt. In our present text, the transparent as
well as the trans-olfacient ether are clearly indicated, the
trans-sonant not clearly.</p></div>

Sound, according to Aristotle, arises from the shock of two or more
solid bodies communicated to the air. It implies local movement in one
at least of those bodies. Many soft bodies are incapable of making
sound; those best suited for it are such as  metals, hard in structure,
smooth in surface, hollow in shape. The blow must be smart and quick,
otherwise the air slips away and dissipates itself before the sound can
be communicated to it.<a name="FnAnchor12_84" href="#Footnote12_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> Sound is communicated through the air to the organ of hearing; the air is one <i>continuum</i> (not composed of adjacent particles with interspaces), and a wave is propagated from it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>to
 the internal ear, which contains some air enclosed in the sinuous ducts
 within the membrane of the tympanum, congenitally attached to the organ
 itself, and endued with a certain animation.<a name="FnAnchor12_85" href="#Footnote12_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
 This internal air within the ear, excited by the motion propagated from
 the external ear, causes hearing. The ear is enabled to appreciate
accurately the movements of the external air, because it has itself
little or no movement within. We cannot hear with any other part of the
body; because it is only in the ear that nature has given us this stock
of internal air. If water gets into the ear, we cannot hear at all;
because the wave generated in the air without, cannot propagate itself
within. Nor can we hear, if the membrane of the ear be disordered; any
more than we can see, when the membrane of the eye is disordered.<a name="FnAnchor12_86" href="#Footnote12_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a></p>

He says that for sonorous purposes air ought to be &#7936;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957; — compact or
dense: sound reverberates best from metals with smooth surface, p. 420,

Voice is a kind of sound peculiar to animated beings; yet not belonging
to all of them, but only to those that inspire the air. Nature employs
respiration for two purposes: the first, indispensable to animal life, —
 that of cooling and tempering the excessive heat of the heart and its
adjacent parts; the second, not indispensable to life, yet most valuable
 to the higher faculties of man, — significant speech. The organ of
respiration is the larynx; a man cannot speak either when inspiring or
expiring, but only when retaining and using the breath within. The soul
in those parts, when guided by some phantasm or thought, impels the air
within against the walls of the trachea, and this shock causes vocal
sounds.<a name="FnAnchor12_87" href="#Footnote12_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a></p>

<p>
Aristotle seems to have been tolerably satisfied with the above
explanation of sight and hearing; for, in approaching the sense of Smell
 with the olfacients, he begins by saying that it is less definable and
explicable. Among the five senses, smell stands intermediate between the
 two (taste and touch) that operate by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>direct
 contact, and the other two (sight and hearing) that operate through an
external medium. Man is below other animals in this sense; he
discriminates little in smells except the pleasurable and the painful.<a name="FnAnchor12_88" href="#Footnote12_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a>
 His taste, though analogous in many points to smell, is far more
accurate and discriminating, because taste is a variety of touch; and in
 respect to touch, man is the most discriminating of all animals. Hence
his great superiority to them in practical wisdom. Indeed the marked
difference of intelligence between one man and another, turns mainly
upon the organ of touch: men of hard flesh (or skin) are by nature dull
in intelligence, men of soft flesh are apt and clever.<a name="FnAnchor12_89" href="#Footnote12_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a>
 The classifying names of different smells are borrowed from the names
of the analogous tastes to which they are analogous — sweet, bitter,
tart, dry, sharp, smooth, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchor12_90" href="#Footnote12_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a>
 Smells take effect through air as well as through water; by means of a
peculiar agency or accompaniment (mentioned above, called the
Trans-Olfacient) pervading both one and the other. It is peculiar to man
 that he cannot smell except when inhaling air in the act of
inspiration; any one may settle this for himself by making the trial.<a name="FnAnchor12_91" href="#Footnote12_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
 But fishes and other aquatic animals, which never inhale air, can smell
 in the water; and this proves that the trans-olfacient agency is
operative to transmit odours not less in water than in air.<a name="FnAnchor12_92" href="#Footnote12_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a>
 We know that the sense of smell in these aquatic animals is the same as
 it is in man, because the same strong odours that are destructive to
man are also destructive to them.<a name="FnAnchor12_93" href="#Footnote12_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a>
 Smell is the parallel, and in a certain sense the antithesis of taste;
smell is of the dry, taste is of the moist: the olfactory matter is a
juicy or sapid dryness, extracted or washed out from both air and water
by the trans-olfacient agency, and acting on the sensory potentialities
of the nostrils.<a name="FnAnchor12_94" href="#Footnote12_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>This
 olfactory inhalation is warm as well as dry. Hence it is light, and
rises easily to the brain, the moisture and coldness of which it
contributes to temper; this is a very salutary process, for the brain is
 the wettest and coldest part of the body, requiring warm and dry
influences as a corrective. It is with a view to this correction that
Nature has placed the olfactory organ in such close proximity to the
brain.<a name="FnAnchor12_95" href="#Footnote12_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a>
 There are two kinds of olfactory impressions. One of them is akin to
the sense of taste — odour and savour going together — an affection (to a
 great degree) of the nutritive soul; so that the same odour is
agreeable when we are hungry, disagreeable when our hunger is fully
satisfied. This first kind of impression is common to men with other
animals; but there is a second, peculiar to man, and disconnected from
the sense of taste, viz., the scent of flowers, unguents, &amp;c., which
 are agreeable or disagreeable constantly and <i>per se</i>.<a name="FnAnchor12_96" href="#Footnote12_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a>
 Nature has assigned this second kind of odours as a privilege to man,
because his brain, being so large and moist, requires to be tempered by
an additional stock of drying and warming olfactory influence.</p>

Taste is a variety of touch, and belongs to the lower or nutritive soul,
 as a guide to the animal in seeking or avoiding different sorts of
food. The object of taste is essentially liquid, often strained and
extracted from dry food by warmth and moisture. The primary
manifestation of this sensory phenomenon is the contrast of drinkable
and undrinkable.<a name="FnAnchor12_97" href="#Footnote12_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a>
 The organ of taste, the tongue, is a mean between dryness and moisture;
 when either of these is in excess, the organ is disordered. Among the
varieties of taste, there are two fundamental contraries (as in colour,
sound, and the objects of the other senses except touch) from which the
other contrasts are derived. These fundamentals in taste are sweet and
bitter; corresponding to white and black, acute and grave, in colours
and sounds. The sense of taste is potentially sweet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>or bitter; the gustable object is what makes it sweet or bitter in actuality.<a name="FnAnchor12_98" href="#Footnote12_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a></p>

The sense of touch, in which man surpasses all other animals, differs
from the other senses by not having any two fundamental contraries
giving origin to the rest, but by having various contraries alike
fundamental. It is thus hardly one sense, but an aggregate of several
senses. It appreciates the elementary differences of body <i>quâ</i>
body — hot, cold, dry, moist, hard, soft, &amp;c. It is a mean between
each of these two extremes; being potentially either one of them, and
capable of being made to assimilate itself actually to either.<a name="FnAnchor12_99" href="#Footnote12_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a>
 In this sense, the tangible object operates when in contact with the
skin; and, as has been already said, much of the superiority of man
depends upon his superior fineness and delicacy of skin.<a name="FnAnchor12_100" href="#Footnote12_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a>
 Still Aristotle remarks that the true organ of touch is not the skin or
 flesh, but something interior to the flesh. This last serves only as a
peculiar medium. The fact that the sensation arises when the object
touches our skin, does not prove that the skin is the true organ; for,
if there existed a thin exterior membrane surrounding our bodies, we
should still feel the same sensation. Moreover, the body is not in real
contact with our skin, though it appears to be so; there is a thin film
of air between the two, though we do not perceive it; just as, when we
touch an object under water, there is a film of water interposed
between, as is seen by the wetness of the finger.<a name="FnAnchor12_101" href="#Footnote12_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a>
 The skin is, therefore, not the true organ of touch, but a medium
between the object and the organ; and this sense does in reality agree
with the other senses in having a certain medium interposed between
object and organ. But there is this difference: in touch the medium is
close to and a part of ourselves; in sight and hearing it is exterior to
 ourselves, and may extend to some distance. In sight and hearing the
object does not affect us directly; it affects the external medium,
which again affects us. But in touch the object affects, at the same
time and by the same influence, both the medium and the interior organ;
like a spear that, with the same thrust, pierces the warrior’s shield
and wounds the warrior himself.<a name="FnAnchor12_102" href="#Footnote12_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>Apparently, therefore, the true organ of touch is something interior, and skin and flesh is an interposed medium.<a name="FnAnchor12_103" href="#Footnote12_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a>
 But what this interior organ is, Aristotle does not more particularly
declare. He merely states it to be in close and intimate communication
with the great central focus and principle of all sensation — the heart;<a name="FnAnchor12_104" href="#Footnote12_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a>
 more closely connected with the heart (he appears to think) than any of
 the other organs of sense, though all of them are so connected more or
less closely.</p>

This analogy of the warrior pierced at the same time with his shield illustrates Aristotle’s view of the eighth Category — <i>Habere</i>:
 of which he gives &#8037;&#960;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; as the example. He considers a man’s clothes
 and defensive weapons as standing in a peculiar relation to him like a
personal appurtenance and almost as a part of himself. It is under this
point of view that he erects <i>Habere</i> into a distinct Category.</p></div>

Having gone through the five senses <i>seriatim</i>, Aristotle offers
various reasons to prove that there neither are, nor can be, more than
five; and then discusses some complicated phenomena of sense. We
perceive <i>that</i> we see or hear;<a name="FnAnchor12_105" href="#Footnote12_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a> do we perceive this by sight or by hearing? and if not, by what other faculty?<a name="FnAnchor12_106" href="#Footnote12_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a>
 Aristotle replies by saying that the act of sense is one and the same,
but that it may be looked at in two different points of view. We see a
coloured object; we hear a sound: in each case the act of sense is one;
the energy or actuality of the <i>visum</i>, and <i>videns</i>, of the <i>sonans</i> and <i>audiens</i>,
 is implicated and indivisible. But the potentiality of the one is quite
 distinct from the potentiality of the other, and may be considered as
well as named apart.<a name="FnAnchor12_107" href="#Footnote12_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> When we say: I perceive <i>that</i> I see — we look at the same act of vision from the side of the <i>videns</i>; the <i>visum</i>
 being put out of sight as the unnoticed correlate. This is a mental
fact distinct from, though following upon, the act of vision itself.
Aristotle refers it rather to that general sentient soul or faculty, of
which the five senses are partial and separate manifestations, than to
the sense of vision itself.<a name="FnAnchor12_108" href="#Footnote12_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> He thus considers what would now be termed <i>consciousness of a sensation</i>, as being merely the subjective view of the sensation, distinguished by abstraction from the objective.</p>

 that we see or hear.” But Sir William Hamilton has remarked that the
word Consciousness has no equivalent usually or familiarly employed in
the Greek psychology.</p></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>It is
 the same general sentient faculty, though diversified and logically
distinguishable in its manifestations, that enables us to conceive many
sensations as combined into one; and to compare or discriminate
sensations belonging to different senses.<a name="FnAnchor12_109" href="#Footnote12_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a></p>

White and sweet are perceived by two distinct senses, and at two
distinct moments of time; but they must be compared and discriminated by
 one and the same sentient or cogitant act, and at one moment of time.<a name="FnAnchor12_110" href="#Footnote12_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a>
 This mental act, though in itself indivisible, has yet two aspects, and
 is thus in a certain sense divisible; just as a point taken in the
middle of a line, while indivisible in itself, may be looked upon as the
 closing terminus of one-half of the line, and as the commencing
terminus of the other half. The comparison of two different sensations
or thoughts is thus one and the same mental fact, with two
distinguishable aspects.<a name="FnAnchor12_111" href="#Footnote12_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a></p>

and to &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, p. 426, b. 22-31; p. 427, a. 9.</p></div>
<p>
Aristotle devotes a chapter to the enquiry: whether we can perceive two distinct sensations at once (<i>i.e.</i>
 in one and the same moment of time). He decides that we cannot; that
the sentient soul or faculty is one and indivisible, and can only have a
 single energy or actuality at once.<a name="FnAnchor12_112" href="#Footnote12_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a>
 If two causes of sensation are operative together, and one of them be
much superior in force, it will render us insensible to the other. He
remarks that, when we are pre-occupied with loud noise, or with deep
reflection, or with intense fright, visual objects will often pass by us
 unseen and unnoticed.<a name="FnAnchor12_113" href="#Footnote12_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a>
 Often the two simultaneous sensations will combine or blend into one
compound, so that we shall feel neither of them purely or separately.<a name="FnAnchor12_114" href="#Footnote12_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a>
 One single act of sensational energy may however have a double aspect;
as the same individual object may be at once white and sweet, though its
 whiteness and its sweetness are logically separable.<a name="FnAnchor12_115" href="#Footnote12_115"><span class="sp">115</span></a></p>

To the sentient soul, even in its lowest manifestations, belong the feelings of pleasure and pain, appetite and aversion.<a name="FnAnchor12_116" href="#Footnote12_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>movements connected with these feelings, as with all sensation, begin and close with the central organ — the heart.<a name="FnAnchor12_117" href="#Footnote12_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a>
 Upon these are consequent the various passions and emotions; yet not
without certain faculties of memory and phantasy accompanying or
following the facts of sense.</p>

Aristotle proceeds by gradual steps upward from the Sentient soul to the
 Noëtic (Cogitant or Intelligent) soul, called in its highest perfection
 Noûs. While refuting the doctrine of Empedokles, Demokritus, and other
philosophers, who considered cogitation or intelligence to be the same
as sensible perception, and while insisting upon the distinctness of the
 two as mental phenomena, he recognizes the important point of analogy
between them, that both of them include judgment and comparison;<a name="FnAnchor12_118" href="#Footnote12_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a>
 and he describes an intermediate stage called Phantasy or Imagination,
forming the transition from the lower of the two to the higher. We have
already observed that, in the Aristotelian psychology, the higher
functions of the soul presuppose and are built upon the lower as their
foundation, though the lower do not necessarily involve the higher.
Without nutrition, there is no sense; without sense, there is no
phantasy; without phantasy, there is no cogitation or intelligence.<a name="FnAnchor12_119" href="#Footnote12_119"><span class="sp">119</span></a>
 The higher psychical phenomena are not identical with the lower, yet
neither are they independent thereof; they presuppose the lower as a
part of their conditions. Here, and indeed very generally elsewhere,
Aristotle has been careful to avoid the fallacy of confounding or
identifying the conditions of a phenomenon with the phenomenon itself.<a name="FnAnchor12_120" href="#Footnote12_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a></p>

He proceeds to explain Phantasy or the Phantastic department of the
soul, with the phantasms that belong to it. It is not sensible
perception, nor belief, nor opinion, nor knowledge, nor cogitation. Our
dreams, though affections of the sentient soul, are really phantasms in
our sleep, when there is no visual sensation; even when awake, we have a
 phantasm of the sun, as of a disk one foot in diameter, though we <i>believe</i> the sun to be larger than the earth.<a name="FnAnchor12_121" href="#Footnote12_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a> Many of the lower animals have sensible perception without any phantasy: even those among <span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>them
 that have phantasy have no opinion; for opinion implies faith,
persuasion, and some rational explanation of that persuasion, to none of
 which does any animal attain.<a name="FnAnchor12_122" href="#Footnote12_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a>
 Phantasy is an internal movement of the animated being (body and soul
in one); belonging to the sentient soul, not to the cogitant or
intelligent; not identical with the movement of sense, but continued
from or produced by that, and by that alone; accordingly, similar to the
 movement of sense and relating to the same matters.<a name="FnAnchor12_123" href="#Footnote12_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a>
 Since our sensible perceptions may be either true or false, so also may
 be our phantasms. And, since these phantasms are not only like our
sensations, but remain standing in the soul long after the objects of
sense have passed away, they are to a great degree the determining
causes both of action and emotion. They are such habitually to animals,
who are destitute of Noûs; and often even to intelligent men, if the
Noûs be overclouded by disease or drunkenness.<a name="FnAnchor12_124" href="#Footnote12_124"><span class="sp">124</span></a></p>

In the chapter now before us, Aristotle is careful to discriminate
phantasy from several other psychological phenomena wherewith it is
liable to be confounded. But we remark with some surprise, that neither
here, nor in any other part of his general Psychology, does he offer any
 exposition of Memory, the phenomenon more nearly approaching than any
other to phantasy. He supplied the deficiency afterwards by a short but
valuable tract on Memory and Reminiscence; wherein he recognizes, and
refers to, the more general work on Psychology. Memory bears on the
past, as distinguished both from the present and future. Memory and
phantasy are in some cases so alike, that we cannot distinguish clearly
whether what is in our minds is a remembrance or a phantasm.<a name="FnAnchor12_125" href="#Footnote12_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a>
 Both of them belong to the same psychological department — to the
central sentient principle, and not to the cogitant or intelligent Noûs.
 Memory as well as phantasy are continuations, remnants, or secondary
consequences, of the primary movements of sense; what in itself is a
phantasm, may become an object of remembrance directly and <i>per se</i>;
 matters of cogitation, being included or implicated in phantasms, may
also become objects of remembrance, indirectly and by way of
accompaniment.<a name="FnAnchor12_126" href="#Footnote12_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a> We <span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>can
 remember our prior acts of cogitation and demonstration; we can
remember that, a month ago, we demonstrated the three angles of a
triangle to be equal to two right angles; but, as the original
demonstration could not be carried on without our having before our
mental vision the phantasm of some particular triangle, so neither can
the remembrance of the demonstration be made present to us without a
similar phantasm.<a name="FnAnchor12_127" href="#Footnote12_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a>
 In acts of remembrance we have a conception of past time, and we
recognize what is now present to our minds as a copy of what has been
formerly present to us, either as perception of sense or as actual
cognition;<a name="FnAnchor12_128" href="#Footnote12_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a>
 while in phantasms there is no conception of past time, nor any similar
 recognition, nor any necessary reference to our own past mental states;
 the phantasm is looked at by itself, and not as a copy. This is the
main point of distinction between phantasm and remembrance:<a name="FnAnchor12_129" href="#Footnote12_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a>
 what is remembered is a present phantasm assimilated to an impression
of the past. Some of the superior animals possess both memory and
phantasy. But other animals have neither; their sensations disappear,
they have no endurance; while endurance is the basis both of phantasy
and memory.<a name="FnAnchor12_130" href="#Footnote12_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a></p>

But though some animals have memory, no animal except man has Reminiscence. Herein man surpasses them all.<a name="FnAnchor12_131" href="#Footnote12_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a>
 Aristotle draws a marked distinction between the two; between the
(memorial) retentive and reviving functions, when working unconsciously
and instinctively, and the same two functions, when stimulated and
guided by a deliberate purpose of our own — which he calls reminiscence.
 This last is like a syllogism or course of ratiocinative inference,
performable only by minds capable of taking counsel and calculating. He
considers memory as a movement proceeding from the centre and organs of
sense to the soul, and stamping an impression thereupon; while
reminiscence is a counter-movement proceeding from the soul to the
organs of sense.<a name="FnAnchor12_132" href="#Footnote12_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> In the process of reminiscence, movements of the soul and movements of the body are conjoined,<a name="FnAnchor12_133" href="#Footnote12_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>more
 or less perturbing and durable according to the temperament of the
individual. The process is intentional and deliberate, instigated by the
 desire to search for and recover some lost phantasm or cognition; its
success depends upon the fact that there exists by nature a regular
observable order of sequence among the movements of the system, physical
 as well as psychical. The consequents follow their antecedents either
universally, or at least according to customary rules, in the majority
of cases.<a name="FnAnchor12_134" href="#Footnote12_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a></p>

The consequent is either (1) like its antecedent, wholly or partially;
or (2) contrary to it; or (3) has been actually felt in juxtaposition
with it. In reminiscence, we endeavour to regain the forgotten
consequent by hunting out some antecedent whereupon it is likely to
follow; taking our start either from the present moment or from some
other known point.<a name="FnAnchor12_135" href="#Footnote12_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a>
 We run over many phantasms until we hit upon the true antecedent; the
possibility of reminiscence depends upon our having this within our
mental reach, among our accessible stock of ideas: if such be not the
case, reminiscence is impracticable, and we must learn over again.<a name="FnAnchor12_136" href="#Footnote12_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a>
 We are most likely to succeed, if we get upon the track or order
wherein events actually occurred; thus, if we are trying to recollect a
forgotten verse or sentence, we begin to repeat it from the first word;
the same antecedent may indeed call up different consequents at
different times, but it will generally call up what has habitually
followed it before.<a name="FnAnchor12_137" href="#Footnote12_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a></p>

The movements of Memory and of Reminiscence are partly corporeal and
partly psychical, just as those of Sensation and Phantasy are. We
compare in our remembrance greater and less (either in time or in
external magnitudes) through similar internal movements differing from
each other in the same, proportion, but all on a miniature scale.<a name="FnAnchor12_138" href="#Footnote12_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a>
 These internal movements often lead to great discomfort, when a person
makes fruitless efforts to recover the forgotten phantasm that he
desires; especially with excitable men, who are much disturbed by their
own phantasms. They cannot stop the movement once begun; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>and,
 when their sensitive system is soft and flexible, they find that they
have unwittingly provoked the bodily movements belonging to anger or
fear, or some other painful emotion.<a name="FnAnchor12_139" href="#Footnote12_139"><span class="sp">139</span></a>
 These movements, when once provoked, continue in spite of the
opposition of the person that experiences them. He brings upon himself
the reality of the painful emotion; just as we find that, after we have
very frequently pronounced a sentence or sung a song, the internal
movements left in our memories are sometimes so strong and so
persistent, that they act on our vocal organs even without any volition
on our parts, and determine us to sing the song or pronounce the
sentence over again in reality.<a name="FnAnchor12_140" href="#Footnote12_140"><span class="sp">140</span></a> Slow men are usually good in memory, quick men and apt learners are good in reminiscence: the two are seldom found together.<a name="FnAnchor12_141" href="#Footnote12_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a></p>

<p>
In this account of Memory and Reminiscence, Aristotle displays an acute
and penetrating intelligence of the great principles of the Association
of Ideas. But these principles are operative not less in memory than in
reminiscence: and the exaggerated prominence that he has given to the
distinction between the two (determined apparently by a wish to keep the
 procedure of man apart from that of animals) tends to perplex his
description of the associative process. At the same time, his manner of
characterizing phantasy, memory, and reminiscence, as being all of them
at once corporeal and psychical — involving, like sensation, internal
movements of the body as well as phases of the consciousness, sometimes
even passing into external movements of the bodily organs without our
volition — all this is a striking example of psychological observation,
as well as of consistency in following out the doctrine laid down at the
 commencement of his chief treatise: Soul as the Form implicated with
Body as the Matter, — the two being an integral concrete separable only
by abstraction.</p>
<p>
We come now to the highest and (in Aristotle’s opinion) most honourable
portion of the soul — the Noûs or noëtic faculty, whereby we cogitate,
understand, reason, and believe or opine under the influence of reason.<a name="FnAnchor12_142" href="#Footnote12_142"><span class="sp">142</span></a> According to the uniform scheme <span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>of
 Aristotle, this highest portion of the soul, though distinct from all
the lower, presupposes them all. As the sentient soul presupposes the
nutrient, so also the cogitant soul presupposes the nutrient, the
sentient, the phantastic, the memorial, and the reminiscent. Aristotle
carefully distinguishes the sentient department of the soul from the
cogitant, and refutes more than once the doctrine of those philosophers
that identified the two. But he is equally careful to maintain the
correlation between them, and to exhibit the sentient faculty not only
as involving in itself a certain measure of intellectual discrimination,
 but also as an essential and fundamental condition to the agency of the
 cogitant, as a portion of the human soul. We have already gone through
the three successive stages — phantastic, memorial, reminiscent —
whereby the interval between sensation and cogitation is bridged over.
Each of the three is directly dependent on past sensation, either as
reproduction or as corollary; each of them is an indispensable condition
 of man’s cogitation; moreover, in the highest of the three, we have
actually slid unperceived into the cogitant phase of the human soul; for
 Aristotle declares the reminiscent process to be of the nature of a
syllogism.<a name="FnAnchor12_143" href="#Footnote12_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a>
 That the soul cannot cogitate or reason without phantasms — that
phantasms are required for the actual working of the human Noûs — he
affirms in the most explicit manner.<a name="FnAnchor12_144" href="#Footnote12_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a></p>

<p>
The doctrine of Aristotle respecting Noûs has been a puzzle, even from
the time of his first commentators. Partly from the obscurity inherent
in the subject, partly from the defective condition of his text as it
now stands, his meaning cannot be always clearly comprehended, nor does
it seem that the different passages can be completely reconciled.</p>
<p>
Anaxagoras, Demokritus, and other philosophers, appear to have spoken of
 Noûs or Intellect in a large and vague sense, as equivalent to Soul
generally. Plato seems to have been the first to narrow and specialize
the meaning; distinguishing pointedly (as we have stated above) the
rational or encephalic soul, in the cranium, with its circular
rotations, from the two lower souls, <span class="correction" title="amended from 'thoraic'">thoracic</span>
 and abdominal. Aristotle agreed with him in this distinction (either of
 separate souls or of separate functions in the same soul); but he
attenuated and divested it of all connexion with separate corporeal
lodgment, or with peculiar movements of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>any
 kind. In his psychology, the brain no longer appears as the seat of
intelligence, but simply as a cold, moist, and senseless organ, destined
 to countervail the excessive heat of the heart: which last is the great
 centre of animal heat, of life, and of the sentient soul. Aristotle
declares Noûs not to be connected with, or dependent on, any given
bodily organs or movements appropriated to itself: this is one main
circumstance distinguishing it from the nutrient soul as well as from
the sentient soul, each of which rests indispensably upon corporeal
organs and agencies of its own.</p>
<p>
It will be remembered that we stated the relation of Soul to Body (in
Aristotle’s view) as that of Form to Matter; the two together
constituting a concrete individual, numerically one; also that Form and
Matter, each being essentially relative to the other, admitted of
gradations, higher and lower; <i>e.g.</i> a massive cube of marble is already <i>materia formata</i>, but it is still purely <i>materia</i>,
 relative to the statue that may be obtained from it. Now, the grand
region of Form is the Celestial Body — the vast, deep, perceivable,
circular mass circumscribing the Kosmos, and enclosing, in and around
its centre, Earth with the other three elements, tenanted by substances
generated and perishable. This Celestial Body is the abode of divinity,
including many divine beings who take part in its eternal rotations,
viz. the Sun, Moon, Stars, &amp;c., and other Gods. Now, every soul, or
every form that animates the matter of a living being, derives its
vitalizing influence from this celestial region. All seeds of life
include within them a spiritual or gaseous heat, more divine than the
four elements, proceeding from the sun, and in nature akin to the
element of the stars. Such solar or celestial heat differs generically
from the heat of fire. It is the only source from whence the principle
of life, with the animal heat that accompanies it, can be obtained.
Soul, in all its varieties, proceeds from hence.<a name="FnAnchor12_145" href="#Footnote12_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a></p>

<p>
But though all varieties of Soul emanate from the same celestial source,
 they possess the divine element in very different degrees, and are very
 unequal in comparative worth and dignity. The lowest variety, or
nutritive soul — the only one possessed by plants, among which there is
no separation of sex<a name="FnAnchor12_146" href="#Footnote12_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a> — is contained potentially in the seed, and is thus transmitted when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>that
 seed is matured into a new individual. In animals, which possess it
along with the sensitive soul and among which the sexes are separated,
it is also contained potentially in the generative system of the female
separately; and the first commencement of life in the future animal is
thus a purely vegetable life.<a name="FnAnchor12_147" href="#Footnote12_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a>
 The sensitive soul, the characteristic of the complete animal, cannot
be superadded except by copulation and the male semen. The female, being
 comparatively impotent and having less animal heat, furnishes only the
matter of the future offspring; form, or the moving, fecundating, cause,
 is supplied by the male. Through the two together the new individual
animal is completed, having not merely the nutritive soul, but also the
sentient soul along with it.<a name="FnAnchor12_148" href="#Footnote12_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a></p>

Both the nutritive and the sentient souls have, each of them
respectively, a special bodily agency and movement belonging to them.
But the Noûs, or the noëtic soul, has no partnership with any similar
bodily agency. There is no special corporeal potentiality (to speak in
Aristotelian language) which it is destined to actualize. It enters from
 without, and emanates from a still more exalted influence of that
divine celestial substance from which all psychical or vitalizing heat
proceeds.<a name="FnAnchor12_149" href="#Footnote12_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
 It is superinduced upon the nutritive and sentient souls, and
introduces itself at an age of the individual later than both of them.
Having no part of the bodily organism specially appropriated to it, this
 variety of soul — what is called the Noûs — stands distinguished from
the other two in being perfectly separable from the body;<a name="FnAnchor12_150" href="#Footnote12_150"><span class="sp">150</span></a>
 that is, separable from the organized body which it is the essential
function of the two lower souls to actualize, and with which both of
them are bound up. The Noûs is not separable from the body altogether;
it belongs essentially to the divine celestial body, and to those
luminaries and other divine beings by whom portions of it are tenanted.
Theorizing contemplation — the perfect, unclouded, unembarrassed,
exercise of the theoretical Noûs — is the single mental activity of
these divinities; contemplation of the formal regularity of the Kosmos,
with its eternal and faultless rotations, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>482</span>and
 with their own perfection as participating therein. The celestial body
is the body whereto Noûs, or the noëtic soul, properly belongs;<a name="FnAnchor12_151" href="#Footnote12_151"><span class="sp">151</span></a>
 quite apart from the two other souls, sentient and nutritive, upon
which it is grafted in the animal body; and apart also from all the
necessities of human action, preceded by balanced motives and deliberate
 choice.<a name="FnAnchor12_152" href="#Footnote12_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a></p>

From this celestial body, a certain influence of Noûs is transferred to
some of the mortal inhabitants of earth, water, and air. Thus a third or
 noëtic soul — or rather a third noëtic function — is added to the two
existing functions, sensitive and nutrient, of the animal soul, which
acquires thereby an improved aptitude for, and correlation with, the
Formal and Universal. We have already stated that the sensitive soul
possesses this aptitude to a certain extent; it receives the impression
of sensible forms, without being impressed by the matter accompanying
them. The noëtic function strengthens and sharpens the aptitude; the
soul comes into correlation with those cogitable or intellective forms
which are involved in the sensible forms;<a name="FnAnchor12_153" href="#Footnote12_153"><span class="sp">153</span></a> it rises from the lower generalities of the Second Philosophy, to the higher generalities of the First Philosophy.</p>
<p>

<p>
As the sentient or percipient soul is the form or correlate of all
perceivables, and thus identified with them in nature, all of them
having existence only in relation to it, — so the cogitant or
intellective soul is the form or correlate of all cogitables, all of
which exist relatively to it, and only relatively.<a name="FnAnchor12_154" href="#Footnote12_154"><span class="sp">154</span></a> It is in fact the highest of all forms — the Form of Forms; the mental or subjective aspect of all formal reality.</p>

Such at least is the tendency and purpose of that noëtic influence which
 the celestial substance imparts to the human soul; but it is realized
only to a very small degree. In its characteristic theorizing efficacy,
the godlike Noûs counts for a small fraction of the whole soul, though
superexcellent in quality.<a name="FnAnchor12_155" href="#Footnote12_155"><span class="sp">155</span></a> There are but few men in whom it is tolerably developed, and even in those few it is countervailed by many other agencies.<a name="FnAnchor12_156" href="#Footnote12_156"><span class="sp">156</span></a> The noëtic function in men and animals exists <span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>only
 in companionship with the two other psychical functions. It is
subservient to the limits and conditions that they impose, as well as to
 the necessities of individual and social action; to all that is
required for “acting like a man,” according to the Aristotelian phrase.
Man’s nature is complex, and not self-sufficing for a life of theorizing
 contemplation, such as that wherein the celestial inmates pass their
immortality of happiness.<a name="FnAnchor12_157" href="#Footnote12_157"><span class="sp">157</span></a></p>

We have thus to study the noëtic function according to the
manifestations of it that we find in man, and to a certain extent in
some other privileged animals. Bees, for example, partake in the divine
gift to a certain extent; being distinguished in this respect from their
 analogues — wasps and hornets.<a name="FnAnchor12_158" href="#Footnote12_158"><span class="sp">158</span></a></p>

remarkable that &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#972;&#962;, the epithet here applied by Aristotle to bees,
 is the epithet that he also applies to men of theoretical and
speculative activity, as contrasted with men prudent and judicious in
action (see Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ii. p. 983, a. 2; also Ethic. Nikom. VI. vii. p. 1141, b. 6). Elsewhere he calls bees &#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#956;&#945; (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span>
 i. p. 980, b. 22). See a good note of Torstrick (on Aristot. De Animâ,
III. p. 428, a. 10), p. 172 of his Commentary. Aristotle may possibly
have been one among the philosophers that Virgil had in his mind, in
Georgics, iv. 219:—</p>
<p></p><table class="reg" summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">  “His quidam signis, atque hæc exempla secuti,<br>
   Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, et haustus<br>

<p>
In these and other animals, and in man to a still greater degree, the
theorizing activity exists; but it is either starved, or at least has to
 deal with materials obscure, puzzling, conflicting; while, on the other
 hand, the practical intellect becomes largely developed, through the
pressure of wants and desires, combined with the teaching of experience.
 In Aristotle’s view, sensible perception is a separate source of
knowledge, accompanied with judgment and discrimination, independent of
the noëtic function. Occasionally, he refers the intellectual
superiority of man to the properly attempered combination and antagonism
 of heat in the heart with cold in the brain, each strong and pure;<a name="FnAnchor12_159" href="#Footnote12_159"><span class="sp">159</span></a> all the highly endowed animals (he says) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span>have greater animal heat, which is the essential condition of a better soul;<a name="FnAnchor12_160" href="#Footnote12_160"><span class="sp">160</span></a> he reckons the finer sense of touch possessed by man as an essential condition of the same intellectual result.<a name="FnAnchor12_161" href="#Footnote12_161"><span class="sp">161</span></a>
 Sensible perception in its five diverse manifestations, together with
its secondary psychical effects — phantasy and memory, accumulates in
the human mind (and in some animals) a greater or less experience of
particular facts; from some of which inferences are drawn as to others

We may
remark that Aristotle considers cold as in some cases a positive
property, not simply as the absence or privation of heat (De Partibus
Animal. II. ii. p. 649, a. 18). The heart is the part wherein the
psychical fire (as it were) is kept burning: &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962; &#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;

(483), laments that he is disqualified for deep philosophical studies by
 the want of heat round his heart:—</p><table class="reg" summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td><div class="poem">

All this process — a perpetual movement of sense and memory — begins
from infancy, and goes on independently of Noûs or the noëtic function
properly so called; which grows up gradually at a later age, aided by
the acquisition of language and by instruction conveyed through
language. The supervening Noûs presupposes and depends upon what has
been thus treasured up by experience. Though, in the celestial body.
Noûs exists separately from human beings, and though it there operates <i>proprio motu</i>
 apart from sense, such is not the case with the human Noûs; which
depends upon the co-operation, and is subject to the restrictions, of
the complicated soul and body wherewith it is domiciled — restrictions
differing in each individual case. Though the noëtic process is distinct
 from sense, yet without sense it cannot take place in man. Aristotle
expressly says: “You cannot cogitate without a phantasm or without a
continuous image.” Now the phantasm has been already explained as a
relic of movements of sense — or as those movements themselves, looked
at in another point of view.<a name="FnAnchor12_163" href="#Footnote12_163"><span class="sp">163</span></a>
 “When we cogitate” (he says), “our mental affection is the same as when
 we draw a triangle for geometrical study; for there, though we do not
make use of the fact that the triangle is determinate in its magnitude,
we still draw it of a determinate magnitude. So in cogitation, even when
 we are not cogitating a determinate <i>quantum</i>, we nevertheless set before our eyes a determinate <i>quantum</i>, but we do not cogitate it <i>quatenus</i> determinate.”<a name="FnAnchor12_164" href="#Footnote12_164"><span class="sp">164</span></a> We <span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>485</span>cannot even (he goes on to say) remember the <i>cogitabilia</i> without “a phantasm or sensible image; so that our memory of them is only by way of concomitance” (indirect and secondary).<a name="FnAnchor12_165" href="#Footnote12_165"><span class="sp">165</span></a>
 Phantasy is thus absolutely indispensable to cogitation: first to
carrying on the process at all; next to remembering it after it is past.
 Without either the visible phantasm of objects seen and touched, or the
 audible phantasm of words heard and remembered, the Noûs in human
beings would be a nullity.<a name="FnAnchor12_166" href="#Footnote12_166"><span class="sp">166</span></a></p>

This passage appears to be as clear a statement of the main doctrine of
Nominalism as can be found in Hobbes or Berkeley. In the sixteenth
section of the Introduction to the Principles of Human Knowledge,
Berkeley says:—“And here it must be acknowledged that a man may consider
 a figure merely as triangular, without attending to the particular
qualities of the angles or relations of the sides. — In like manner we
may consider Peter to far forth as man, or so far forth as animal,
without framing the forementioned idea, either of man or animal, <i>inasmuch as all that is perceived is not considered</i>.” Berkeley has not improved upon the statement of Aristotle.</p></div>

We see that, though Aristotle recognizes a general distinction between
phantasy and cogitation, and alludes to many animals as having the
former without attaining to the latter, yet he also declares that in
man, who possesses both, not only is cogitation dependent upon phantasy,
 but phantasy passes into cogitation by gradations almost imperceptible.
 In regard to the practical application of Noûs (<i>i.e.</i> to animal
movements determined either by appetite or by reason), he finds a great
difficulty in keeping the distinction clearly marked. Substantially,
indeed, he lets it drop. When he speaks of phantasy as being either
calculating or perceptive, we are unable to see in what respect <i>calculating phantasy</i> (which he states not to belong to other animals) differs from an effort of cogitation.<a name="FnAnchor12_167" href="#Footnote12_167"><span class="sp">167</span></a>
 Indeed, he speaks with some diffidence respecting any distribution of
parts in the same soul, suspecting that such distribution is not real
but logical: you may subdivide as much as you choose.<a name="FnAnchor12_168" href="#Footnote12_168"><span class="sp">168</span></a></p>

It thus appears clear that Aristotle restricts the Noûs or noëtic function <i>in man</i>
 to the matters of sense and experience, physical or mental, and that he
 considers the phantasm to be an essential accompaniment of the
cogitative act. Yet this does not at all detract from his view of the
grandeur, importance, and wide range of survey, belonging to the noëtic
function. It is the portion of man’s nature that correlates with the
abstract and universal; but it is only a portion of his nature, and must
 work in conjunction and harmony with the rest. The abstract cannot be
really separated from the concrete, nor the universal from one or other
of its particulars, nor the essence from that whereof it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>the
 essence, nor the attribute from that of which it is the attribute, nor
the genus and species from the individuals comprehended therein; nor, to
 speak in purely Aristotelian language, the Form from some Matter, or
the Matter from some Form. In all these cases there is a <i>notional</i> or <i>logical</i>
 distinction, impressing the mind as the result of various comparisons,
noted by an appropriate term, and remembered afterwards by means of that
 term (that is, by means of an audible or visible phantasm); but real
separation there neither is nor can be. This is the cardinal principle
of Aristotle, repeated in almost all his works — his marked antithesis
against Plato. Such logical distinctions as those here noticed (they
might be multiplied without number) it belongs to Noûs or the noëtic
function to cognize. But the real objects, in reference to which alone
the distinctions have a meaning, are concrete and individual; and the
cognizing subject is really the entire man, employing indeed the noëtic
function, but employing it with the aid of other mental forces,
phantasms and remembrances, real and verbal.</p>
<p>
The noëtic soul is called by Aristotle “the place of Forms,” “the
potentiality of Forms,” “the correlate of things apart from Matter.”<a name="FnAnchor12_169" href="#Footnote12_169"><span class="sp">169</span></a>
 It cogitates these Forms in or along with the phantasms: the cogitable
Forms are contained in the sensible Forms; for there is nothing really
existent beyond or apart from visible or tangible magnitudes, with their
 properties and affections, and with the so-called abstractions
considered by the geometer. Hence, without sensible perception, a man
can neither learn nor understand anything; in all his theoretical
contemplations, he requires some phantasm to contemplate along with
them.<a name="FnAnchor12_170" href="#Footnote12_170"><span class="sp">170</span></a></p>

<p>
Herein lies one of the main distinctions between the noëtic and the
sentient souls. The sentient deals with particulars, and correlates with
 external bodies; the noëtic apprehends universals, which in a certain
sense are within the soul: hence a man can cogitate whenever or whatever
 he chooses, but he can see or touch only what is present.<a name="FnAnchor12_171" href="#Footnote12_171"><span class="sp">171</span></a>
 Another distinction is, that the sentient soul is embodied in special
organs, each with determinate capacities, and correlating with external
objects, themselves alike determinate, acting only under certain
conditions of locality. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>The
 possibilities of sensation are thus from the beginning limited;
moreover, a certain relative proportion must be maintained between the
percipient and the perceivable; for extreme or violent sounds, colours,
&amp;c., produce no sensation; on the contrary, they deaden the sentient
 organ.<a name="FnAnchor12_172" href="#Footnote12_172"><span class="sp">172</span></a> But the noëtic soul (what is called the “Noûs of the soul,” to use Aristotle’s language)<a name="FnAnchor12_173" href="#Footnote12_173"><span class="sp">173</span></a>
 is nothing at all in actuality before its noëtic function commences,
though it is everything in potentiality. It is not embodied in any
corporeal organ of its own, nor mingled as a new elementary ingredient
with the body; it does not correlate with any external objects; it is
not so specially attached to some particulars as to make it antipathetic
 to others. Accordingly its possibilities of cogitation are unlimited;
it apprehends with equal facility what is most cogitable and what is
least cogitable. It is thoroughly indeterminate in its nature, and is in
 fact at first a mere unlimited cogitative potentiality;<a name="FnAnchor12_174" href="#Footnote12_174"><span class="sp">174</span></a> like a tablet, upon which no letters have as yet been written, but upon which all or any letters <i>may be</i> written.<a name="FnAnchor12_175" href="#Footnote12_175"><span class="sp">175</span></a></p>

<p>
We have already said that the Noûs of the human soul emanates from a
peculiar influence of the celestial body, which is the special region of
 Form in the Kosmos. Through it we acquire an enlarged power of
apprehending the abstract and universal; we can ascend above sensible
forms to the cogitable forms contained therein; we can consider all
forms in themselves, without paying attention to the matter wherein they
 are embodied. Instead of considering the concrete solid or liquid
before us, we can mentally analyse them, and thus study solidity in the
abstract, fluidity in the abstract. While our senses judge of water as
hot and cold, our noëtic function enables us to appreciate water in the
abstract — to determine its essence, and to furnish a definition of it.<a name="FnAnchor12_176" href="#Footnote12_176"><span class="sp">176</span></a>
 In all these objects, as combinations of Form with Matter, the
cogitable form exists potentially; and is abstracted or considered
abstractedly, by the cogitant Noûs.<a name="FnAnchor12_177" href="#Footnote12_177"><span class="sp">177</span></a>
 Yet this last (as we have already seen) cannot operate except along
with and by aid of phantasms — of impressions revived or remaining from
sense. It is thus immersed in the materials of sense, and has no others.
 But it handles them in a way of its own, and under new points of view;
comparing and analysing; recognizing the abstract in the concrete, and
the universal in the particular; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>488</span>discriminating
 mentally and logically the one from the other; and noting the
distinction by appropriate terms. Such distinctions are the <i>noümena</i>,
 generated in the process of cogitation by Noûs itself. The Noûs, as it
exists in any individual, gradually loses its original character of
naked potentiality, and becomes an actual working force, by means of its
 own acquired materials.<a name="FnAnchor12_178" href="#Footnote12_178"><span class="sp">178</span></a> It is an aggregate of <i>noümena</i>,
 all of them in nature identical with itself; and, while cogitating
them, the Noûs at the same time cogitates itself. Considered
abstractedly, apart from matter, they exist only in the mind itself; in
theoretical speculation, the <i>cognoscens</i> and the <i>cognitum</i> are identical. But they are not really separable from matter, and have no reality apart from it.</p>

The distinction, yet at the same time correlation, between Form and
Matter, pervades all nature (Aristotle affirms), and will be found in
the Noûs as elsewhere. We must recognize an <i>Intellectus Agens</i> or constructive, and an <i>Intellectus Patiens</i> or receptive.<a name="FnAnchor12_179" href="#Footnote12_179"><span class="sp">179</span></a> The <i>Agens</i>
 is the great intellectual energy pervading the celestial body, and
acting upon all the animals susceptible of its operation; analogous to
light, which illuminates the diaphanous medium, and elevates what was
mere potential colour into colour actual and visible.<a name="FnAnchor12_180" href="#Footnote12_180"><span class="sp">180</span></a> The <i>Patiens</i>
 is the intellectual receptivity acted upon in each individual, and
capable of being made to cogitate every thing; anterior to the <i>Agens</i>,
 in time, so far as regards the individual, yet as a general fact (when
we are talking of man as a species) not anterior even in time, but
correlative. Of the two, the <i>Intellectus Agens</i> is the more
venerable; it is pure intellectual energy, unmixed, unimpressible from
without, and separable from all animal body. It is this, and nothing
more, when considered apart from animal body; but it is then eternal and
 immortal, while the <i>Intellectus Patiens</i> perishes with the remaining soul and with the body. Yet though the <i>Intellectus Agens</i> is thus eternal, and though <i>we</i> have part in it, we cannot remember any of its operations anterior to our own maturity; for the concurrence of the <i>Intellectus Patiens</i>, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>489</span>begins and ends with us, is indispensable both to remembrance and to thought.<a name="FnAnchor12_181" href="#Footnote12_181"><span class="sp">181</span></a></p>

chapter (difficult even to Theophrastus the friend and pupil of the
author), we have given the best meaning that the words seem to admit.</p></div>
<p>
We see here the full extent of Aristotle’s difference from the Platonic
doctrine, in respect to the immortality of the soul. He had defined soul
 as the first actualization of a body having potentiality of life with a
 determinate organism. This of course implied, and he expressly declares
 it, that soul and body in each individual case were one and
indivisible, so that the soul of Sokrates perished of necessity with the
 body of Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchor12_182" href="#Footnote12_182"><span class="sp">182</span></a>
 But he accompanied that declaration with a reserve in favour of Noûs,
and especially of the theorizing Noûs; which he recognized as a
different sort of soul, not dependent on a determinate bodily organism,
but capable of being separated from it, as the eternal is from the
perishable.<a name="FnAnchor12_183" href="#Footnote12_183"><span class="sp">183</span></a>
 The present chapter informs us how far such reserve is intended to go.
That the theorizing Noûs is not limited, like the sentient soul, to a
determinate bodily organism, but exists apart from that organism and
eternally — is maintained as incontestable: it is the characteristic
intellectual activity of the eternal celestial body and the divine
inmates thereof. But the distinction of Form and Matter is here pointed
out, as prevailing in Noûs and in Soul generally, not less than
throughout all other Nature. The theorizing Noûs, as it exists in
Sokrates, Plato, Demokritus, Anaxagoras, Empedokles, Xenokrates,
&amp;c., is individualized in each, and individualized differently in
each. It represents the result of the <i>Intellectus Agens</i> or Formal Noûs, universal and permanent, upon the <i>Intellectus Patiens</i>
 or noëtic receptivity peculiar to each individual; the co-operation of
the two is indispensable to sustain the theorizing intellect of any
individual man. But the <i>Intellectus Patiens</i>, or <i>Receptivus</i>,
 perishes along with the individual. Accordingly, the intellectual life
of Sokrates cannot be continued farther. It cannot be prolonged after
his sensitive and nutritive life has ceased; the noëtic function, as it
exists in him, is subject to the same limits of duration as the other
functions of the soul. The intellectual man is no more immortal than the
 sentient man.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>490</span>Such
is the opinion here delivered by Aristotle. And it follows indeed as a
distinct corollary from his doctrine respecting animal and vegetable
procreation in general. Individuality (the being <i>unum numero</i> in a
 species) and immortality are in his view incompatible facts; the one
excludes the other. In assigning (as he so often does) a final cause or
purpose to the wide-spread fact of procreation of species by animals and
 vegetables, he tells us that every individual living organism, having
once attained the advantage of existence, yearns and aspires to prolong
this for ever, and to become immortal. But this aspiration cannot be
realized; Nature has forbidden it, or is inadequate to it; no individual
 can be immortal. Being precluded from separate immortality, the
individual approaches as near to it as is possible, by generating a new
individual like itself, and thus perpetuating the species. Such is the
explanation given by Aristotle of the great fact pervading the
sublunary, organized world<a name="FnAnchor12_184" href="#Footnote12_184"><span class="sp">184</span></a>
 — immortal species of plants, animals, and men, through a succession of
 individuals each essentially perishable. The general doctrine applies
to Noûs as well as to the other functions of the soul. Noûs is immortal;
 but the individual Sokrates, considered as noëtic or intellectual, can
no more be immortal than the same individual considered as sentient or
reminiscent.</p>

<p>
We have already stated that Noûs — Intellect — the noëtic function — is
that faculty of the soul that correlates with the abstract and
universal; with Form apart from Matter. Its process is at once
analytical, synthetical, and retentive. Nature presents to us only
concretes and particulars, in a perpetual course of change and
reciprocal action; in these the abstract and universal are immersed, and
 out of these they have to be disengaged by logical analysis. That the
abstract is a derivative from the concrete, and the universal from
particulars — is the doctrine of Aristotle. Ascending from particulars,
the analysis is carried so far that at length it can go no farther. It
continues to divide until it comes to <i>indivisibles</i>, or simple
notions, the highest abstractions, and the largest universals. These are
 the elements out of which universal propositions are formed, the first
premisses or <i>principia</i> of demonstration. Unphilosophical minds do
 not reach these indivisibles at all: but it is the function of the
theorizing Noûs to fasten on them, and combine them into true
propositions. In so far as regards the indivisibles themselves,
falsehood is out of the question, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>491</span>truth
 also, since they affirm nothing. The mind either apprehends them, or it
 does not apprehend them: there is no other alternative.<a name="FnAnchor12_185" href="#Footnote12_185"><span class="sp">185</span></a>
 But, when combined into affirmative propositions, they then are true or
 false, as the case may be. The formal essence of each object is among
these indivisibles, and is apprehended as such by the intellect; which,
while confining itself to such essence, is unerring, as each sense is in
 regard to its own appropriate perceivables.<a name="FnAnchor12_186" href="#Footnote12_186"><span class="sp">186</span></a>
 But, when the intellect goes father, and proceeds to predicate any
attribute respecting the essence, then it becomes liable to error, as
sense is when drawing inferences.</p>

<p>
One of the chief functions that Aristotle assigns to Noûs, or the noëtic function, is that the <i>principia</i> of demonstration and knowledge belong to it; and not merely the <i>principia</i>, but also, in cases of action preceded by deliberation and balance of motives, the ultimate application of <i>principia</i>
 to action. So that he styles Noûs both beginning and end; also the
beginning of the beginning; and, moreover, he declares it to be always
right and unerring — equal to Science and even more than Science.<a name="FnAnchor12_187" href="#Footnote12_187"><span class="sp">187</span></a>
 These are high praises, conveying little information, and not
reconcilable with other passages wherein he speaks of the exercise of
the noëtic function (&#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957;) as sometimes right, sometimes wrong.<a name="FnAnchor12_188" href="#Footnote12_188"><span class="sp">188</span></a> But, for the question of psychology, the point to be determined is, in what sense he meant that <i>principia</i>
 belonged to Noûs. He certainly did not mean that the first principles
of reasoning were novelties originated, suggested, or introduced into
the soul by noëtic influence. Not only he does not say this, but he
takes pains to impress the exact contrary. In passages cited a few pages
 back, he declares that Noûs in entering the soul brings nothing
whatever with it; that it is an universal potentiality — a capacity in
regard to truth, but nothing more;<a name="FnAnchor12_189" href="#Footnote12_189"><span class="sp">189</span></a>
 that it is in fact a capacity not merely for comparing and judging (to
both of which he recognizes even the sentient soul as competent), but
also for combining many into one, and resolving the apparent one into
several; for abstracting, generalizing, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>and selecting among the phantasms present, which of them should be attended to, and which should be left out of attention.<a name="FnAnchor12_190" href="#Footnote12_190"><span class="sp">190</span></a>
 Such is his opinion about the noëtic function; and he states explicitly
 that the abstract and universal not only arise from the concrete and
particular, but are inseparable from the same really — separable only
logically.</p>

He describes, at the end of the Analytica Posteriora and elsewhere, the
steps whereby the mind ascends gradually from sense, memory, and
experience, to general principles. And he indicates a curious contrast
between these and the noëtic functions. Sense, memory, phantasy,
reminiscence, are movements of the body as well as of the soul; our
thoughts and feelings come and go, none of them remaining long. But the
noëtic process is the reverse of this; it is an arrest of all this
mental movement, a detention of the fugitive thoughts, a subsidence from
 perturbation — so that the attention dwells steadily and for some time
on the same matters.<a name="FnAnchor12_191" href="#Footnote12_191"><span class="sp">191</span></a>
 Analysis, selection, and concentration of attention, are the real
characteristics of the Aristotelian Noûs. It is not (as some
philosophers have thought) a source of new general truths, let into the
soul by a separate door, and independent of experience as well as
transcending experience.</p>

Passing now to the Emotions, we find that these are not systematically
classified and analysed by Aristotle, as belonging to a scheme of
Psychology; though he treats them incidentally, with great ability and
acuteness, both in his Ethics, where he regards them as auxiliaries or
impediments to a rational plan of life, and in his Rhetoric, where he
touches upon their operation as it bears on oratorical effect. He
introduces however in his Psychology some answer to the question, What
is it that produces local movement in the animal body? He replies that
movement is produced both by Noûs and by Appetite.</p>
<p>
Speaking strictly, we ought to call Appetite alone the direct producing cause, acted upon by the <i>appetitum</i>, which is here the <i>Primum Movens Immobile</i>. But this <i>appetitum</i> cannot act without coming into the intellectual sphere, as something seen, imagined, cogitated.<a name="FnAnchor12_192" href="#Footnote12_192"><span class="sp">192</span></a> In this case the Noûs or Intellect is stimulated through appetite, and operates in subordination thereto. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span>Such is the Intellect, considered as Practical, the principle or determining cause of which is the <i>appetitum</i>
 or object of desire; the Intellect manifesting itself only for the sake
 of some end, to be attained or avoided. Herein it is distinguished
altogether from the Theoretical Noûs or Intellect, which does not
concern itself with any <i>expetenda</i> or <i>fugienda</i> and does not meddle with conduct. The <i>appetitum</i>
 is good, real or apparent, in so far as it can be achieved by our
actions. Often we have contradictory appetites; and, in such cases, the
Intellect is active generally as a force resisting the present and
caring for the future. But Appetite or Desire, being an energy including
 both soul and body, is the real and appropriate cause that determines
us to local movement, often even against strong opposition from the
Intellect.<a name="FnAnchor12_193" href="#Footnote12_193"><span class="sp">193</span></a></p>

Aristotle thus concludes his scheme of Psychology, comprehending all
plants as well as all animals; a scheme differing in this respect, as
well as in others, from the schemes of those that had preceded him, and
founded upon the peculiar principles of his own First Philosophy. Soul
is to organized body as Form to Matter, as Actualizer to the Potential;
not similar or homogeneous, but correlative; the two being only
separable as distinct logical points of view in regard to one and the
same integer or individual. Aristotle recognizes many different
varieties of Soul, or rather many distinct functions of the same soul,
from the lowest or most universal, to the highest or most peculiar and
privileged; but the higher functions presuppose or depend upon the
lower, as conditions; while the same principle of Relativity pervades
them all. He brings this principle prominently forward, when he is
summing up<a name="FnAnchor12_194" href="#Footnote12_194"><span class="sp">194</span></a>
 in the third or last book of the treatise De Animâ:—“The Soul is in a
certain way all existent things; for all of them are either Perceivables
 or Cogitables; and the Cogitant Soul is in a certain way the matters
cogitated, while the Percipient Soul is in a certain way the matters
perceived.” The Percipient and its <i>Percepta</i> — the Cogitant and its <i>Cogitata</i> — each implies and correlates with the other: the Percipient is the highest Form of all <i>Percepta</i>; the Cogitant is the Form of Forms, or the highest of all Forms, cogitable or perceivable.<a name="FnAnchor12_195" href="#Footnote12_195"><span class="sp">195</span></a> The Percipient or Cogitant Subject is thus conceived <span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>494</span>only
 in relation to the Objects perceived or cogitated, while these Objects
again are presented as essentially correlative to the Subject. The
realities of Nature are particulars, exhibiting Form and Matter in one:
though, for purposes of scientific study — of assimilation and
distinction — it is necessary to consider each of the two abstractedly
from the other.</p>

<a name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>
<h2>
<span class="smcap">ETHICA.</span></h2>
<h2>
I. </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Ethics of Aristotle presuppose certain conditions in the persons
to whom they are addressed, without which they cannot be read with
profit. They presuppose a certain training, both moral and intellectual,
 in the pupil.</p>
<p>
First, the reason of the pupil must be so far developed, as that he
shall be capable of conceiving the idea of a scheme of life and action,
and of regulating his momentary impulses more or less by a reference to
this standard. He must not live by passion, obeying without reflection
the appetite of the moment, and thinking only of grasping at this
immediate satisfaction. The habit must have been formed of referring
each separate desire to some rational measure, and of acting or
refraining to act according as such a comparison may dictate. Next, a
certain experience must have been acquired concerning human affairs, and
 concerning the actions of men with their causes and consequences. Upon
these topics all the reasonings and all the illustrations contained in
every theory of Ethics must necessarily turn: so that a person
thoroughly inexperienced would be incompetent to understand them. </p>
<p>
For both these two reasons, no youthful person, nor any person of mature
 years whose mind is still tainted with the defects of youth, can be a
competent learner of Ethics or Politics (Eth. Nic. i. 7. Compare vii.
8). Such a pupil will neither appreciate the reasonings, nor obey the
precepts (i. 3). </p>
<p>
Again, a person cannot receive instruction in Ethics with advantage
unless he has been subjected to a good practical discipline, so as to
have acquired habits of virtuous action, and to have been taught to feel
 pleasure and pain on becoming occasions and in reference to becoming
objects. Unless the circumstances by which he has been surrounded and
the treatment which he has received, have been such as to implant in him
 a certain vein of sentiment and to give a certain direction to his
factitious pleasures and pains  — unless obedience to right <span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>precepts
 has to a certain degree been made habitual with him  — he will not be
able to imbibe, still less to become attached to, even the <i>principia</i>
 of ethical reasoning (Eth. Nic. i. 4. 7). The well-trained man, who has
 already acquired virtuous habits, has within himself the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052;, or
beginning, from which happiness proceeds: he may do very well, even
though the reason on which these habits were formed should never become
known to him: but he will at least readily apprehend and understand the
reason when it is announced. The &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; or beginnings to which ethical
philosophy points and from whence the conduct which it enjoins is
derived, are obtained only by habituation, not by induction nor by
perception, like other &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;: and we ought in all our investigations to
look after the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; in the way which the special nature of the subject
requires, and to be very careful to define it well (i. 4, i. 7).</p>
<p>
In considering Aristotle’s doctrine respecting the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; of ethical and
political science, and the way in which they are to be discovered and
made available, we should keep in mind that he announces the end and
object of these sciences to be, not merely the enlargement of human
knowledge, but the determination of human conduct towards certain
objects: not theory, but practice: not to teach us what virtue is, but
to induce us to practise it  — “Since then the present science is not
concerned with speculation, <i>like the others</i>. For here we enquire,
 not in order that we may know what virtue is, but in order that we may
become good, otherwise there would be no profit in the enquiry” (ii. 2. <i>See</i> also i. 2, i. 5, vi. 5).</p>
<p>
The remarks which Aristotle makes about the different ways of finding
out and arriving at &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054;, are curious. Some principles or beginnings
are obtained by <i>induction</i>  — others by <i>perception</i>  —
others by habituation in a certain way  — others again in other ways.
Other modes of arriving at &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; are noticed by the philosopher himself
in other places. For example, the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; of demonstrative science are
said to be discovered by intellect (&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;)  — vi. 6-7. There is a passage
 however in vi. 8 in which he seems to say that the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; of the wise
man (&#963;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#962;) and the natural man (&#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;) are derived from experience:
which I find it difficult to reconcile with the preceding chapters,
where he calls wisdom a compound of intellect and science (&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;),
and where he gives Thales and Anaxagoras as specimens of wise men. By
vi. 6  — it seems that wisdom has reference to matters of demonstrative
science: how then can it be true that a youth may be a mathematician
without being a wise man?</p>
<p>
Moreover, Aristotle takes much pains, at the commencement <span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>497</span>
 of his treatise on Ethics, to set forth the inherent intricacy and
obscurity of the subject, and to induce the reader to be satisfied with
conclusions not absolutely demonstrative. He repeats this observation
several times  — a sufficient proof that the evidence for his own
opinions did not appear to himself altogether satisfactory (Eth. Nic. i.
 3, i. 7, ii. 2). The completeness of the proof (he says) must be
determined by the subject-matter: a man of cultivated mind will not ask
for better proof than the nature of the case admits: and human action,
to which all ethical theory relates, is essentially fluctuating and
uncertain in its consequences, so that every general proposition which
can be affirmed or denied concerning it, is subject to more or less of
exception. If this degree of uncertainty attaches even to general
reasonings on ethical subjects, the particular applications of these
reasonings are still more open to mistake: the agent must always
determine for himself at the moment, according to the circumstances of
the case, without the possibility of sheltering himself under technical
rules of universal application: just as the physician or the pilot is
obliged to do in the course of his profession. “Now the actions and the
interests of men exhibit no fixed rule, just like the conditions of
health. And if this is the case with the universal theory, still more
does the theory that refers to particular acts present nothing that can
be accurately fixed; for it falls not under any art or any system, but
the actors themselves must always consider what suits the occasion, just
 as happens in the physician’s and the pilot’s art. But though this is
the case with the theory at present, <i>we must try to give it some assistance</i>” (&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#946;&#959;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;).  — Eth. Nic. 2.</p>
<p>
The last words cited are remarkable. They seem to indicate, that
Aristotle regarded the successful prosecution of ethical enquiries as
all but desperate. He had previously said (i. 3)  — “There is so much
difference of opinion and so much error respecting what is honourable
and just, of which political science treats, that these properties of
human action seem to exist merely by positive legal appointment, and not
 by nature. And there is the same sort of error respecting what things
are good, because many persons have sustained injury from them, some
having already been brought to destruction through their wealth, others
through their courage.”</p>
<p>
One cannot but remark how entirely this is at variance with the notion
of a moral sense or instinct, or an intuitive knowledge of what is right
 and wrong. Aristotle most truly observes that the details of our daily
behaviour are subject to such an infinite variety of modifications, that
 no pre-established rules can be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>delivered
 to guide them: we must act with reference to the occasion and the
circumstances. Some few rules may indeed be laid down, admitting of very
 few exceptions: but the vast majority of our proceedings cannot be
subjected to any rule whatever, except to the grand and
all-comprehensive rule, if we are indeed so to call it, of conforming to
 the ultimate standard of morality.</p>
<p>
Supposing the conditions above indicated to be realized  — supposing a
certain degree of experience in human affairs, of rational
self-government, and of habitual obedience to good rules of action, to
be already established in the pupil’s mind, the theory of ethics may
then be unfolded to him with great advantage (i. 3). It is not meant to
be implied that a man must have previously acquired the perfection of
practical reason and virtue before he acquaints himself with ethical
theory; but he must have proceeded a certain way towards the
acquisition.</p>
<p>
Ethics, as Aristotle conceives them, are a science closely analogous to
if not a subordinate branch of Politics. (I do not however think that he
 employs the word &#7976;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8052; in the same distinct and substantive meaning as
&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; (&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;), although he several times mentions &#964;&#8048; &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8048; and
&#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;.) Ethical science is for the individual what political
science is for the community (i. 2).</p>
<p>
In every variety of human action, in each separate art and science, the
agents, individual or collective, propose to themselves the attainment
of some <i>good</i> as the end and object of their proceedings. Ends are
 multifarious, and good things are multifarious: but good, under one
shape or another, is always the thing desired by every one, and the
determining cause of human action (&#959;&#8023; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#966;&#943;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;)  — i. 1.</p>
<p>
Sometimes the action itself, or the exercise of the powers implied in
the action, is the end sought, without anything beyond. Sometimes there
is an ulterior end, or substantive business, to be accomplished by means
 of the action and lying beyond it. In this latter class of cases, the
ulterior end is the real good: better than the course of action used to
accomplish it  — “the external results are naturally (&#960;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#954;&#949;) better
than the course of action” (i. 1). Taking this as a general position, it
 is subject to many exceptions: but the word &#960;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#954;&#949; seems to signify
only that such is naturally and ordinarily the case, not that the
reverse never occurs.</p>
<p>
Again some ends are comprehensive and supreme; others, partial and
subordinate. The subordinate ends are considered with reference to the
supreme, and pursued as means to their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>accomplishment.
 Thus the end of the bridle-maker is subservient to that of the
horseman, and the various operations of war to the general scheme of the
 commander. The supreme, or <i>architectonic</i>, ends, are superior in eligibility to the subordinate, or <i>ministerial</i>, which, indeed, are pursued only for the sake of the former.</p>
<p>
One end (or one <i>good</i>), as subordinate, is thus included in
another end (or another good) as supreme. The same end may be supreme
with regard to one end different from itself, and subordinate with
regard to another. The end of the general is supreme with reference to
that of the soldier or the maker of arms, subordinate with reference to
that of the statesman. In this scale of comprehensiveness of ends there
is no definite limit; we may suppose ends more and more comprehensive as
 we please, and we come from thence to form the idea of one most
comprehensive and sovereign end, which includes under it every other
without exception  — with reference to which all other ends stand in the
 relation either of parts or of means  — and which is itself never in
any case pursued for the sake of any other or independent end. The end
thus conceived is the <i>Sovereign Good of man</i>, or <i>The Good</i>  — <i>The Summum Bonum</i>  — &#932;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#957;  — &#932;&#8056; &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;  — &#932;&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957; (i. 2).</p>
<p>
To comprehend, to define, and to prescribe means for realizing the Sovereign Good, is the object of <i>Political Science</i>,
 the paramount and most architectonic Science of all, with regard to
which all other Sciences are simply ministerial. It is the business of
the political ruler to regulate the application of all other Sciences
with reference to the production of this his End  — to determine how far
 each shall be learnt and in what manner each shall be brought into
practice  — to enforce or forbid any system of human action according as
 it tends to promote the accomplishment of his supreme purpose  — the
Sovereign Good of the Community. Strategical, rhetorical, economical,
science, are all to be applied so far as they conduce to this purpose
and no farther: they are all simply ministerial; political science is
supreme and self-determining (i. 2).</p>
<p>
What <i>Political Science</i> is for the community, <i>Ethical Science</i>
 is for the individual citizen. By this it is not meant that the
individual is to be abstracted from society or considered as living
apart from society: but simply that human action and human feeling is to
 be looked at from the point of view of the individual, mainly and
primarily  — and from the point of view of the society, only in a
secondary manner: while in political science, the reverse is the case  —
 our point of view is, first as regards the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>society;  — next, and subordinate to that, as regards the individual citizen (<i>See</i> Eth. Nic. vii. 8).</p>
<p>
The object of the Ethical Science is, the Supreme Good of the individual
 citizen  — the End of all Ends, with reference to his desires, his
actions, and his feelings  — the end which he seeks for itself and
without any ulterior aim  — the end which comprehends all his other ends
 as merely partial or instrumental and determines their comparative
value in his estimation (i. 2, i. 4).</p>
<p>
It is evident that this conception of an End of all Ends is what Kant would call an <i>Idea</i>
  — nothing precisely conformable to it, in its full extent, can ever
exist in reality. No individual has ever been found, or ever will be
found, with a mind so trained as to make every separate and particular
desire subservient to some general preconceived End however
comprehensive. But it is equally certain that this subordination of Ends
 one to another is a process performed to a greater or less degree in
every one’s mind, even in that of the rudest savage. No man can blindly
and undistinguishingly follow every immediate impulse: the impulse,
whatever it be, when it arises, must be considered more or less as it
bears upon other pursuits and other objects of desire. This is an
indispensable condition even of the most imperfect form of social
existence. In civilized society, we find the process carried very far
indeed in the minds of the greater number of individuals. Every man has
in his view certain leading Ends, such as the maintenance of his proper
position in society, the acquisition of professional success, the making
 of his fortune, the prosecution of his studies, &amp;c., each of which
is essentially paramount and architectonic, and with reference to which a
 thousand other ends are simply subordinate and ministerial. Suppose
this process to be pushed farther, and you arrive at the idea of an End
still more comprehensive, embracing every other end which the individual
 can aspire to, and forming the central point of an all-comprehensive
scheme of life. Such a maximum, never actually attainable, but
constantly approachable, in reality, forms the Object of Ethical
Science. <i>Quorsum victuri gignimur</i>!</p>
<p>
What is the Supreme Good  — the End of all Ends? How are we to determine
 wherein it consists, or by what means it is to be attained  — at least,
 as nearly attained as the limitations of human condition permit?
Ethical Science professes to point out what the end ought to be  —
Ethical precepts are suggestions for making the closest approaches to it
 which are practicable. Even to understand what the end is, is a
considerable acquisition: since we thus know the precise point to aim
at, even if we cannot hit it (i. 2).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>The
approaches which different men make towards forming this idea, of an End
 of Ends or of a Supreme Good, differ most essentially: although there
seems a verbal agreement between them. Every man speaks of <i>Happiness</i>
 as his End of Ends (&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;, i. 4): he wishes to live well
or to do well, which he considers to be the same as being happy. But men
 disagree exceedingly in their opinions as to that which constitutes
happiness: nay the same man sometimes places it in one thing, sometimes
in another  — in health or in riches, according as he happens to be sick
 or poor.</p>
<p>
There are however three grand divisions, in one or other of which the
opinions of the great majority of mankind may be distributed. Some think
 that happiness consists in a life of bodily pleasure (&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962;
&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;): others, in a life of successful political action or
ambition (&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;): others again, in a life of speculative study
and the acquisition of knowledge (&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;). He will not consent
to number the life of the (&#967;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962;) money-maker among them because
he attains his end at the expense of other people and by a force upon
their inclinations (this at least seems the sense of the words  — &#8001; &#947;&#8048;&#961;
&#967;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; &#946;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#943;&#962;  &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;), and because wealth can never be the good,
 seeing that it is merely useful for the sake of ulterior objects.</p>
<p>
(The reason which Aristotle gives for discarding from his catalogue the life of the <i>money-seeker</i>, while he admits that of the <i>pleasure-seeker</i> and the <i>honour-seeker</i>,
 appears a very inconclusive one. He believed them to be all equally
mistaken in reference to real happiness: the two last just as much as
the first: and certainly, if we look to prevalence in the world and
number of adherents, the creed of the first is at least equal to that of
 the two last.)</p>
<p>
The first of the three is the opinion of the mass, countenanced by many
Sovereigns such as Sardanapalus  — it is more suitable to animals than
to men, in the judgment of Aristotle (i. 5).</p>
<p>
Honour and glory  — the reward of political ambition, cannot be the
sovereign good, because it is a possession which the person honoured can
 never be sure of retaining: for it depends more upon the persons by
whom he is honoured than upon himself, while the ideas which we form of
the sovereign good suppose it to be something intimately belonging to us
 and hard to be withdrawn (i. 5). Moreover those who aspire to honour,
desire it not so much on its own account as in order that they may have
confidence in their own virtue: so that it seems even in their
estimation as if virtue were the higher aim of the two. But <span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>even
 virtue itself (meaning thereby the simple possession of virtue as
distinguished from the active habitual exercise of it) cannot be the
sovereign good: for the virtuous man may pass his life in sleep or in
inaction  — or he may encounter intolerable suffering and calamity (i.
5).</p>
<p>
Besides, Happiness as we conceive it, is an End perfect, final,
comprehensive and all-sufficient  — an end which we always seek on its
own account and never with a view to anything ulterior. But neither
honour, nor pleasure, nor intelligence, nor virtue, deserves these
epithets: each is an end special, insufficient, and not final  — for
each is sought partly indeed on its own account, but partly also on
account of its tendency to promote what we suppose to be our happiness
(i. 7). The latter is the only end always sought exclusively for itself:
 including as it always does and must do, the happiness of a man’s
relatives, his children and his countrymen, or of all with whom he has
sympathies; so that if attained, it would render his life desirable and
wanting for nothing  — &#8003; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, &#945;&#7985;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#943;&#959;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#951;&#948;&#949;&#957;&#8056;&#962;
 &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#8118; (i. 7).</p>
<p>
The remark which Aristotle here makes in respect to the final aim or
happiness of an individual  — viz., that it includes the happiness of
his family and his countrymen and of those with whom he has sympathies  —
 deserves careful attention. It shows at once the largeness and the
benevolence of his conceptions. We arrive thus at the same end as that
proposed by political science  — the happiness of the community: but we
reach it by a different road, starting from the point of view of the
individual citizen.</p>
<p>
Having shown that this Happiness, which is “our being’s end and aim,”
does not consist in any special acquisition such as pleasure, or glory,
or intelligence, or virtue, Aristotle adopts a different method to show
wherein it does consist. Every artist and every professional man (he
says  — i. 7), the painter, the musician, &amp;c., has his peculiar
business to do, and the <i>Good</i> of each artist consists in doing his
 business well and appropriately. Each separate portion of man, the eye,
 the hand and the foot, has its peculiar function: and in analogy with
both these, man as such has his business and function, in the complete
performance of which human Good consists. What is the business and
peculiar function of Man, as Man? Not simply Life, for that he has in
common with the entire vegetable and animal world: nor a mere sensitive
Life, for that he has in common with all Animals: it must be something
which he has, apart both from plants and animals  — viz., an active life
 in conformity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>with
 reason (&#960;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;); or the exercise of Reason as a
 directing and superintending force, and the exercise of the appetites,
passions, and capacities, in a manner conformable to Reason. This is the
 special and peculiar business of man: it is what every man performs
either well or ill: and the <i>virtue</i> of a man is that whereby he is
 enabled to perform it well. The Supreme Good of humanity, therefore,
consisting as it does in the due performance of this special business of
 man, is to be found in the virtuous activity of our rational and
appetitive soul: assuming always a life of the ordinary length, without
which no degree of mental perfection would suffice to attain the object.
 The full position will then stand thus  — “Happiness, or the highest
good of a human being, consists in the working of the soul and in a
course of action, pursuant to reason and conformable to virtue,
throughout the full continuance of life.”</p>
<p>
(The argument respecting a man’s proper business (&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;) and virtue
(&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052;) seems to be borrowed from Plato  — Republic, i. c. 23, p. 352;
c. 24, p. 353. Compare also Xenophon  — Memorabilia, iv. 2, 14.)</p>
<p>
This explanation is delivered by Aristotle as a mere outline, which he
seems to think that any one may easily fill up (i. 7). And he warns us
not to require a greater degree of precision than the subject admits of:
 since we ought to be content with a rough approximation to the truth,
and with conclusions which are not universally true, but only true in
the majority of instances, such being the nature of the premisses with
which we deal (i. 3).</p>
<p>
Having determined in this manner what Happiness or the Supreme Good
consists in, Aristotle next shows that the explanation which he gives of
 it conforms in a great degree to the opinions previously delivered by
eminent philosophers, and fulfils at least all the requisite conditions
which have ever been supposed to belong to Happiness (i. 8). All
philosophers have from very early times agreed in distributing good
things into three classes  — <i>Mental</i>, <i>Corporeal</i>, and <i>External</i>. Now the first of these classes is incomparably the highest and most essentially <i>good</i> of the three: and the explanation which Aristotle gives of happiness ranks it in the first class.</p>
<p>
Again, various definitions of happiness have been delivered by eminent
authorities more or less ancient (&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#943;). Eudoxus laid down
 the principle that happiness consists in pleasure: others have
maintained the opinion that it is entirely independent both of pleasure
and pain  — that the former is no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>good,
 and the latter no evil (i. 12, vii. 11-13, x. 1. 2). Some have placed
happiness in virtue: others in prudence: others in a certain sort of
wisdom (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#953;&#962;): others have added to the definition this condition,
that pleasure or external prosperity should be coupled with the
above-mentioned objects (i. 8). The moral doctrines propounded by Zeno
and Epicurus were therefore in no way new: how far the reasonings by
which these philosophers sustained them were new we cannot judge
accurately, from the loss of the treatises of Eudoxus and others to
which Aristotle makes reference.</p>
<p>
Now, in so far as virtue is introduced, the explanation of Happiness
given by Aristotle coincides with these philosophers and improves upon
them by substituting the active exercise of virtuous habits in place of
the mere possession of virtue. And in regard to pleasure, the man who
has once acquired habits of virtuous agency stands in no need of
pleasure from without, as a foreign accessory: for he finds pleasure in
his own behaviour, and he would not be denominated virtuous unless he
did so: “Now (he says) their life stands in no need of pleasure, like an
 extraneous appendage, but has pleasure in itself” (ii. 8). Again, ii.
3, he says that “the symptom of a perfect habit is the pleasure or pain
which ensues upon the performance of the acts in which the habit
consists: for the man who abstains from bodily pleasures and rejoices in
 doing so, is temperate, while he who does it reluctantly and painfully,
 is intemperate. And the man who sustains dangers with pleasure, or at
least without pain, is courageous: if with pain, he is a coward. For
ethical virtue has reference to our pleasures and pains: it is on
account of pleasure that we commit vicious acts, and on account of pain
that we shrink from virtuous performances. Wherefore, as Plato directs,
we ought to be trained at once from our infancy by some means or other
so as to feel pleasure and pain from the proper sources: for that is the
 right education.”</p>
<p>
Moreover, the man who is in the active exercise of virtue derives his
pleasure from the performance of that which is the appropriate business
of humanity, so that all his pleasures are <i>conformable to the pleasures natural to man</i>
 and therefore consistent with each other: whereas the pleasures of most
 people are contradictory and inconsistent with each other, because they
 are not conformable to our nature (i. 8).</p>
<p>
It is not easy to understand perfectly what Aristotle means by saying
that the things agreeable to the majority of mankind are not things
agreeable by nature. The construction above put upon this expression
seems the only plausible one  — that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>those
 pleasures which inhere in the performance of the appropriate business
of man, are to be considered as our natural pleasures; those which do
not so inhere, as not natural pleasures: inasmuch as they arise out of
circumstances foreign to the performance of our appropriate business.</p>
<p>
This however hardly consists with the explanation which Aristotle gives
of &#964;&#8056; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;  — in another place and with reference to another subject.
In the Magna Moralia (i. 34, pp. 1194-1195 Bek.), in distinguishing
between <i>natural</i> justice (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;) and <i>conventional</i> justice (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#8179;), he tells us that <i>the naturally just</i>
 is that which most commonly remains just. (Similarly Ethic. Eudem. iv.
14, p. 1217 Bek.) That which exists by nature (he says) may be changed
by art and practice; the left hand may by these means be rendered as
strong as the right in particular cases, but if in the greater number of
 cases and for the longer portion of time the left remains left and the
right remains right, this is to be considered as existing by nature.</p>
<p>
If we are to consider that arrangement as natural which we find to
prevail in the greatest number of cases and for the greatest length of
time, then undoubtedly the pleasures arising out of virtuous active
behaviour must be regarded as less natural than those other pleasures
which Aristotle admits to form the enjoyment of the majority of mankind.</p>
<p>
But again there is a third passage, respecting nature and natural
arrangements, which appears scarcely reconcilable with either of the two
 opinions just noticed. In Eth. Nicom. ii. 1: “Ethical virtue is a
result of habit, whence it is evident that not one of the ethical
virtues exists in us by nature. For none of those things which exist by
nature is altered by habit. For example, the stone which naturally moves
 downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if a man
should endeavour so to habituate it by throwing it upwards ten thousand
times; nor in like manner fire downwards: nor can any other of the
things formed by nature in one way be changed by habit to any other than
 that natural way. Virtues therefore are not generated in us either <i>by</i> nature, or <i>contrary</i>
 to nature; but we are formed by nature so as to be capable of receiving
 them, and we are perfected in them through the influence of habit.”</p>
<p>
If it be true that nothing which exists in one manner by nature can be
changed by habit so as to exist in another manner, I do not see how the
assertion contained in the passage above cited out of the Magna Moralia
can be reconciled with it, where we are told  — “For even things which
exist <i>by nature partake of change</i>. Thus if we all should practise throwing with the left <span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>hand,
 we should become ambidextrous: but still it is the left hand by nature,
 and the right hand is not the less better by nature than the left,
although we should do everything with the left as we do with the right.”
 (Mag. Mor. i. 34, <i>ut sup.</i>) In the one case he illustrates the
meaning of natural properties by the comparative aptitudes of the right
and left hand: in the other by the downward tendency of the stone. The
idea is plainly different in the one case and in the other.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there seems to be not less variance between the one
passage quoted out of the Nicomacheian Ethics and the other. For in the
passage last quoted, we are told that none of the ethical virtues is
generated in us by nature  — neither by nature, nor contrary to nature:
nature makes us fit to receive them, habit introduces and creates them  —
 an observation perfectly true and accurate. But if this was the
sentiment of Aristotle, how could he also believe that the pleasures
arising out of the active manifestation of ethical virtue were the
natural pleasures of man? If ethical virtue does not come by nature, the
 pleasures belonging to it cannot come by nature either.</p>
<p>
On the whole, these three passages present a variance which I am unable
to reconcile in the meaning which Aristotle annexes to the very
equivocal word  — <i>nature</i>.</p>
<p>
Although Aristotle tells us that the active exercise of the functions of
 the soul according to virtue confers happiness, yet he admits that a
certain measure of external comfort and advantages must be superadded as
 an indispensable auxiliary and instrument. Disgusting ugliness, bad
health, low birth, loss of friends and relatives or vicious conduct of
friends and relatives, together with many other misfortunes, are
sufficient to sully the blessed condition of the most virtuous man
(&#8165;&#965;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;  — i. 8)  — for which reason it is that some
persons have ranked both virtue and good fortune as co-ordinate
ingredients equally essential to happiness: and have doubted also
whether it can ever be acquired either by teaching, or by training, or
by any other method except chance or Divine inspiration. To suppose that
 so magnificent a boon is conferred by chance, would be an absurdity: it
 is a boon not unworthy indeed of the Divine nature to confer; but still
 the magnificence of it will appear equally great and equally
undeniable, if we suppose it to be acquired by teaching or training. And
 this is really the proper account to give of the way in which Happiness
 is acquired: for the grand and primary element in it, is the virtuous
agency of the soul, which is undoubtedly acquired by training: while
external advantages, though indispensable up to a certain <span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>limit,
 are acquired only as secondary helps and instruments. The creation of
these virtuous habits among the citizens is one of the chief objects of
political science and legislation: when once acquired, they are the most
 lasting and ineffaceable of all human possessions: and as they are
created by special training, they may be imparted to every man not
disqualified by some natural defect of organization, and may thus be
widely diffused throughout the community (i. 9).</p>
<p>
This is an important property. If happiness be supposed to be derived
from the possession of wealth or honour or power, it can only be
possessed by a small number of persons. For these three considered as
objects of human desire, are essentially comparative. A man does not
think himself rich, or honoured, or powerful, unless he becomes so to a
degree above the multitude of his companions and neighbours.</p>
<p>
Aristotle insists most earnestly that the only way of acquiring the
character proper for happiness is by a course of early and incessant
training in virtuous action. Moral teaching, he says, will do little or
nothing, unless it be preceded by, or at least coupled with, moral
training. Motives must be applied sufficient to ensure performance of
what is virtuous and abstinence from what is vicious, until such a
course of conduct becomes habitual, and until a disposition is created
to persevere in them. It is the business of the politician and the
legislator to employ their means of working upon the citizens for the
purpose of enforcing this training. It is not with virtue (he says) as
it is with those faculties which we receive ready-made from nature, as
for example, the external senses. We do not acquire the faculty of sight
 by often seeing, but we have it from nature and then exercise it:
whereas with regard to virtue, we obtain our virtues by means of a
previous course of virtuous action, just as we learn other arts. For
those things which we must learn in order to do, we learn by actually
doing: thus by building we become builders, and by harping we become
harpers: by doing just and temperate and courageous actions, we become
just and temperate and courageous. All legislators try, some in a better
 and others in a worse manner, to <i>ethise</i> (&#7952;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;)  — to create
 habits among  — the citizens for the purpose of making them good. “In
one word habits are created by repeated action, wherefore our actions
must be determined in a suitable way, for according as they differ, so
will our habits differ. Nor is the difference small whether we are <i>ethised</i> in one way or in another, from our youth upwards: the difference is very great, or rather it <i>is everything</i>” (ii. 1).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>Neither
 an ox, nor a horse, can acquire such habits, and therefore neither of
them can be called happy: even a child cannot be called so, except from
the hope and anticipation of what he will become in future years.</p>
<p>
It may appear somewhat singular that Aristotle characterises a child as
incapable of happiness, since in common language a child when healthy
and well treated is described as peculiarly happy. But happiness, as
Aristotle understands it, is something measured more by the estimate of
the judicious spectator than by the sentiment of the man in whose bosom
it resides. No person is entitled to be called <i>happy</i>, whom the intelligent and reflective observer does not <i>macarise</i> (or <span class="correction" title="amended from'endæmonise'"><i>eudæmonise</i></span>),
 or whose condition he would not desire more or less to make his own.
Now the life of a child, even though replete with all the enjoyments
belonging to childhood, is not such as any person in the state of mind
of a mature citizen could bring himself to accept (i. 10, x. 3). The
test to which Aristotle appeals, either tacitly or openly, seems always
to be the judgment of the serious man (i. 8, x. 5). It is no sufficient
proof of happiness that the person who feels it is completely satisfied
with his condition and does not desire anything beyond. Such
self-satisfaction is indeed necessary, but is not by itself sufficient:
it must be farther confirmed by the judgment of persons without  — not
of the multitude, who are apt to judge by a wrong standard  — nor of
princes, who are equally incompetent, <i>and who have never tasted the relish of pure and liberal pleasures</i>
 (x. 6)  — but of the virtuous and worthy, who have arrived at the most
perfect condition attainable by human beings (x. 5, x. 6, x. 8).</p>
<p>
The different standard adopted by the many and by the more discerning
few, in estimating human happiness, is again touched upon in Politica,
vii. 1. It is in some respects treated more clearly and simply in this
passage than in the Ethics. Both the Many and the Few (he says) agree
that in order to constitute Happiness, there must be a coincidence of
the three distinct kinds of Good things  — The Mental  — The Corporeal  —
 The External. But with respect to the proportions in which the three
ought to be intermingled, a difference of opinion arises. Most persons
are satisfied with a very moderate portion of mental excellence, while
they are immoderate in their desire for wealth and power (“For of virtue
 they think that they have a sufficiency, whatever be the quantity they
have; but of wealth and possessions they seek the excess without bound.”
  — Pol. vii. 1). On the other hand, the opinion sanctioned by the few
of a higher order of mind, and adopted by Aristotle, was, that Happiness
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>was
possessed in a higher degree by those who were richly set forth with
moral and intellectual excellence and only moderately provided with
external advantages, than by those in regard to whom the proportion was
reversed (<i>ib.</i>). The same difference of estimate, between the few
and the many, is touched upon Polit. vii. 13, where he says that men in
general esteem external advantages to be the causes of happiness: which
is just as if they were to say that the cause why a musician played well
 was his lyre, and not his proficiency in the art.</p>
<p>
In this chapter of the Politica (vii. 13), he refers to the Ethica in a
singular manner. Having stated that the point of first importance is, to
 determine wherein happiness consists, he proceeds to say  — “We have
said also in the Ethics, <i>if there be any good in that treatise</i>
(&#949;&#7988; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#8004;&#966;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;), that it (happiness) is the active
exertion and perfected habit of virtue.”  — This is a singular
expression  — “if there be any good in the Ethics”  — it seems rather to
 fall in with the several passages in that treatise in which he insists
upon the inherent confusion and darkness of the subject-matter.</p>
<p>
The definition of what happiness really is seems to be one of the weak
points of Aristotle’s treatise. In a work addressed to the public, it is
 impossible to avoid making the public judges of the pleasure and pain,
the happiness and unhappiness of individuals. A certain measure of
self-esteem on the part of the individual, and a certain measure of
esteem towards him on the part of persons without, come thus to be
regarded as absolutely essential to existence. Without these, life would
 appear intolerable to any spectator without, though the individual
himself might be degraded enough to cling to it. But these are secured
by the ordinary morality of the age and of the locality. The question
arises as to degrees of virtue beyond the ordinary level: Are we sure
that such higher excellence contributes to the happiness of the
individual who possesses it? Assuming that it does so contribute, are we
 certain that the accession of happiness which he thereby acquires is
greater than he would have acquired by an increase of his wealth and
power, his virtue remaining still at the ordinary level? These are
points which Aristotle does not establish satisfactorily, although he
professes to have done so: nor do I think that they are capable of being
 established. The only ground on which a moralist can inculcate
aspirations after the higher degrees of virtue, is, the gain which
thereby accrues to the happiness of others, not to that of the
individual himself.</p>
<p>
Aristotle appeals to God as a proof of the superiority of an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>internal
 source of happiness to an external source  — vii. 1, “using God as a
witness who is happy and blessed, yet not through any external good, but
 through Himself and from His own nature.” Again, vii. 3, “For at
leisure God would be happy, and the whole universe (&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;), who have no
 external actions except such as are proper to themselves”  — in proof
of the superiority of a life of study and speculation to a life of
ambition and political activity. The same argument is insisted upon in
Eth. Nic. x. 8. It is to be observed that the &#922;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; as well as God is
here cited as experiencing happiness.</p>
<p>
The analogy to which Aristotle appeals here is undoubtedly to a certain
extent a just one. The most perfect happiness which we can conceive  —
our Idea, to use Kant’s phrase, of perfect happiness  — is that of a
being who is happy in and for his own nature, with the least possible
aid from external circumstances  — a being whose nature or habits
dispose him only to acts, the simple performance of which confers
happiness. But is this true of the perfectly virtuous nature and habits?
 Does the simple performance of the acts to which they dispose us,
always confer happiness? Is not the existence of a very high standard of
 virtuous exigency in a man’s mind, a constant source of
self-dissatisfaction, from the difficulty of acting up to his own ideas
of what is becoming and commendable?</p>
<p>
That the most virtuous nature is in itself and essentially the most
happy nature, is a point highly questionable  — to say the least of it:
and even if we admit the fact, we must at the same time add that it
cannot appear to be so to ordinary persons without. The internal
pleasures of a highly virtuous man cannot be properly appreciated by any
 person not of similar character. So that unless a person be himself
disposed to believe it, you could find no means of proving it to him. To
 a man not already virtuous, you cannot bring this argument persuasively
 home for the purpose of inducing him to become so.</p>
<p>
In regard to prudence and temperance, indeed, qualities in the first
instance beneficial to himself, it is clear that the more perfectly he
possesses them, the greater and more assured will be his happiness. But
in regard to virtuous qualities, beneficial in the first instance to
others and not to himself, it can by no means be asserted that the
person who possesses these qualities in the highest degree is happier
than one who possesses them in a more moderate and ordinary degree.</p>
<p>
Aristotle indeed says that <i>the being just</i> necessarily includes
the having pleasure in such behaviour: for we do not call a man just or
liberal unless he has a pleasure in justice or liberality <span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>(Eth. Nic. i. 8). But this does not refute the supposition, that another man, less just or liberal than he, may enjoy <i>greater happiness</i> arising out of other tastes and other conduct.</p>
<p>
In order to sustain the conclusion of Aristotle respecting the superior
happiness of the virtuous man, it is necessary to assume that the
pleasures of self-esteem and self-admiration are generically
distinguished from other pleasures and entitled to a preference in the
eyes of every right judging person. And Aristotle does seem to assume
something of this nature. He says  — x. 3  — “Or that pleasures differ
in kind? For the pleasures arising from the honourable are different
from those arising from the base; and it is not the case that the unjust
 man experiences the pleasure of the just, or he that is unmusical that
of the musician.” The inherent difference between various pleasures is
again touched upon x. 5  — “And since the functions differ in goodness
and badness  — some of them being objects of desire, others of them to
be eschewed, and others of them neither  — so is it likewise with the
pleasures: for each function has its own pleasures. The pleasure then
that is proper to the function of good is good, and that which is proper
 to the function of bad is bad; for the desires of things honourable are
 praiseworthy, those of things base are to be blamed. And the pleasures
attaching to them are more proper to the functions than are the
appetencies themselves.” In the next chapter, in that remarkable passage
 where he touches upon the predilections of men in power for the society
 of jesters and amusing companions (“The many have recourse to the
amusements of those that are accounted happy”)  — “For it is not in
kingly power that you find either virtue or intellect, on which the
higher functions of man depend. Nay, not if princes <i>who have never tasted the relish of pure and liberal pleasure</i>,
 have recourse to the pleasures of the body, on which account these must
 be thought the more desirable. For children consider those things to be
 best that are held in honour among themselves.”</p>
<p>
Here we have a marked distinction drawn between the different classes of
 pleasures  — some being characterised as good, some bad, some
indifferent. The best of all are those which the virtuous man enjoys,
and which <i>he</i> considers the best: the pleasures inseparably
annexed to virtuous agency. These pleasures are thus assumed to be of a
purer and more exalted character, and to deserve a decided preference
over every other class of pleasures. And if this be assumed, the
superior happiness of the virtuous man follows as a matter of course.</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>I
should observe that Aristotle considers happiness to consist in the
exercise of the faculties agreeably to virtue (&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#964;’ &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052;&#957;)  —
the <i>pleasure</i> (&#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8052;) is something different from the exercise
(&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;)  — inseparably attending it, indeed, yet not the same  —
“conjoined with the functions (&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962;), and the two are so
inseparable as to raise a question whether the function is not identical
 with the pleasure” (x. 5). And he says, x. 7  — “We think that pleasure
 should be mixed up (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#967;&#952;&#945;&#953;) with happiness.”</p>
<p>
It seems to be in the sense of self-esteem, which constitutes the
distinctive mark of virtuous agency, that Aristotle supposes happiness
to consist: the pleasure he supposes to be an inseparable concomitant,
but yet not the same. The self-esteem is doubtless often felt in cases
where a man is performing a painful duty  — where the sum total of
feelings accompanying the performance of the act is the very reverse of
pleasurable. But still the self-esteem, or testimony of an approving
conscience, is <i>per se</i> always pleasurable, and is in fact the
essential pleasure inherent in virtuous behaviour. I do not see the
propriety of the distinction here taken by Aristotle. He puts it
somewhat differently, Polit. vii. 1  — “Living happily consists either
in joy or in virtue to men, or in both.” And Polit. viii. 5  — “For
happiness is a compound of both these (honour and pleasure).” So Polit.
viii. 3.</p>
<p>
Happiness (again he says  — Polit. vii. 13, p. 440 E. p. 286) consists
in the perfect employment and active exercise of virtue: and that <i>absolutely</i>
 (or under the most favourable external conditions)  — not under
limitation (&#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;) or subject to very trying and difficult
circumstances. For a man of virtue may be so uncomfortably placed that
he has no course open to him except a choice of evils, and can do
nothing but make the best of a bad position. Such a man will conduct
himself under the pressure of want or misfortune as well as his case
admits: but happiness is out of his reach. (Compare Eth. Nic. i. 10.) To
 be happy, it is necessary that he should be so placed as to be capable
of aspiring to the accomplishment of positive good and advantage  — he
must be admitted to contend for the great prizes, and to undertake
actions which lead to new honours and to benefits previously unenjoyed:
he must be relieved from the necessity of struggling against
overwhelming calamities.</p>
<p>
Aristotle tells us in the beginning of the Ethics (Eth. Nic. i. 3)  —
“But there is so much difference of opinion and so much error respecting
 what is honourable and just, of which political science treats, that
these properties of human action seem to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>exist
 merely by positive legal appointment, and not by nature. And there is
the same sort of error respecting what things are good.” If there be
this widespread error and dissension among mankind with respect to the
determining of what is good and just, what standard has Aristotle
established for the purpose of correcting it? I do not find that he has
established any standard, nor even that he has thought it necessary to
make the attempt. There are indeed a great number of observations, and
many most admirable observations in his Treatise, on the various
branches of Virtue and Vice: many which tend to conduct the mind of the
reader unconsciously to the proper standard: but no distinct
announcement of any general principle, whereby a dispute between two
dissentient moralists may be settled. When he places virtue in a certain
 mediocrity between excess on one side and defect on the other, this
middle point is not in any way marked or discoverable: it is a point not
 fixed, but variable according to the position of the individual agent,
and is to be determinable in every case by right reason and according to
 the judgment of the prudent man  — “in the mean <i>with reference to ourselves</i>, as <i>it has been determined by reason</i>, and <i>as the prudent man</i> (&#8001; &#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;) <i>would determine it</i>”
 (Eth. Nic. ii. 6). But though the decision is thus vested in the
prudent man, no mention is made of the principle which the appointed
arbiter would follow in delivering his judgment, assuming a dispute to
arise.</p>
<p>
In a previous part of Chapter II., he defines “the mean with reference
to ourselves” to be “that which neither exceeds, nor falls short of, <i>the rule of propriety</i> (&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#941;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;). But this is not one, nor is it the same to all.”</p>
<p>
To render this definition sufficient and satisfactory, Aristotle ought to have pointed out to us how we are to find out that <i>rule of propriety</i> (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#941;&#959;&#957;) which marks and constitutes the medium point, of actions and affections, <i>in relation to ourselves</i>  — this medium point being in his opinion <i>virtue</i>. To explain what is meant by a medium <i>in relation to ourselves</i>, by the words &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#941;&#959;&#957;, <i>the rule of propriety</i>, is only a change of language, without any additional information.</p>
<p>
Thus the capital problem of moral philosophy still remains unsolved.</p>
<p>
It is remarkable that Aristotle in some parts of his treatise states
very distinctly what this problem is, and what are the points essential
to its solution: he speaks as if he were fully aware of that which was
wanting to his own treatise, and as if he were preparing to supply the
defect: but still the promise is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>never realized. Take for example the beginning of Book VI. Eth. Nic.</p>
<p>
“Since it has been already laid down, that we ought to choose the middle
 point and not either the excess or the defect  — and since the middle
point is that which right reason determines  — let us distinguish what
that is. For in all the mental habits which have been described, as well
 as in all others also, there is a certain aim, by a reference to which
the rational being is guided either in relaxing or in restricting: and
there is a certain definite boundary of those medial points, which we
affirm to exist between excess and defect, determinable according to
right reason. To speak thus, however, is indeed correct enough, but it
gives no distinct information (&#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#963;&#945;&#966;&#941;&#962;): for in all other modes
of proceeding which are governed by scientific principles it is quite
just to say that you ought neither to work nor to rest more than is
sufficient nor less than is sufficient, but to a degree midway between
the two and agreeably to right reason. But a man who has only this
information would be no wiser than he was before it, any more than he
would know what things he ought to apply to his body, by being simply
told that he must apply such things as medical science and as the
medical practitioner directed. Wherefore, with respect also to the
habits of the soul we must not be content with merely giving a general
statement in correct language, but we must farther discriminate what
right reason is, and what is its definition.”</p>
<p>
This is a very clear and candid statement of the grand and fundamental
defect in Aristotle’s theory of Ethics. He says very truly that “there
is a certain end and aim (&#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;), to which a rational being has
reference when he either restricts or relaxes any disposition.” It was
incumbent on Aristotle to explain what this &#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962; was; but this he
never does, though he seems so clearly to have felt the want of it. We
might have supposed that after he had pointed out what was required to
impart specific meaning to correct but vague generalities, he would have
 proceeded at once to fill up the acknowledged chasm in his theory: but
instead of this, he enters into an analysis of the intellect,
speculative and practical, and explains the varieties of intellectual,
as contradistinguished from moral, excellence. This part of his work is
highly valuable and instructive: but I cannot find that he ever again
touches upon the &#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;, which had been admitted to be as yet
undetermined. In a certain sense, it is indeed true that he endeavours
“to discriminate what right reason is, and what is its definition:” for
he classifies the intellectual functions into intellect (&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;), science
(&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;), wisdom <span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>(&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;),
 art (&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;), prudence (&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;): he states the general nature of each
of these attributes, and the range of subjects to which it applies. He
tells us that intellect and prudence have reference to human conduct  —
that prudence is “concerned with things just and honourable and good for
 man” (vii. 12)  — “with the things of man, and those things regarding
which we deliberate” (vii. 7)  — “prudence must needs be a true habit
according to reason, concerned with the good of man” (vii. 5). In
explaining what prudence is, he tells us that it is <i>according to reason</i>: in explaining what is <i>right reason</i>, he tells us that it is <i>according to prudence</i>.
 He thus seems to make use of each as a part of the definition of the
other. But however this may be, certain it is that he never fulfils the
expectation held out in the beginning of the Sixth Book, nor ever clears
 up the &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#966;&#8050;&#962; there acknowledged.</p>
<p>
There is one sentence at the beginning of vi. 5, which looks as if it
conveyed additional information upon the difficulty in question  — “Now
it seems to belong to the prudent man to be able to deliberate aright
concerning the things that are good and profitable to himself  — not in
part, as concerning the things that have a reference to health or
strength  — but concerning the things that refer to the whole of <i>living well</i>” (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#8022; &#950;&#8135;&#957;). But this in point of fact explains nothing. For <i>living well</i> is the same as <i>happiness</i>: happiness is <i>the active exercise of the soul according to virtue</i>: therefore <i>virtue</i> must be known, before we can know what <i>living well</i> is.</p>
<p>
I think that this &#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962; or end, which Aristotle alludes to in the
beginning of the Sixth Book as not having been yet made clear, appears
to be more distinctly brought out in a previous passage than it is in
any portion of the Treatise after the beginning of the Sixth Book. In
Book IV. 6, Aristotle treats of the virtues and defects connected with
behaviour in social intercourse: the <i>obsequious</i> at one extreme, the <i>peevish</i> or <i>quarrelsome</i>
 at the other: and the becoming medium, though it had no special name,
which lay between them. Speaking of the person who adopts this becoming
medium, he says  — “We have said generally, then, that he will associate
 with people as he ought; and having, moreover, a constant reference to
what is honourable and what is expedient, he will aim at not giving pain
 or at contributing pleasure.”</p>
<p>
Again in regard to Temperance  — iii. 11  — he states the &#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962; of the
temperate man  — “What things have a reference to health or vigour, and
are agreeable, these he desires in measure and as he ought; as well as
the other agreeable things that are not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>opposed
 to these, either as being contrary to what is honourable or as being
beyond his fortune. For he that desires things agreeable, which yet are
contrary to what is honourable or beyond his fortune, loves these
pleasures more than they are worth. But not so with the temperate man
who lives according to right reason.”</p>
<p>
These passages are not very distinct, as an explanation of the proper
&#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;: but I cannot find any passages after the beginning of the Sixth
Book which are more distinct than they: or perhaps, equally distinct.</p>
<p>
In one passage of the Seventh Book, Aristotle refers, though somewhat
obscurely, to the average degree of virtue exhibited by the mass of
mankind as the standard to be consulted when we pronounce upon excess or
 defect (vii. 7).</p>
<p>
Aristotle seems in some passages to indicate pleasure and pain as the
end with reference to which actions or dispositions are denominated <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>.
 He says  — vii. 11  — “To theorise respecting pleasure and pain, is the
 business of the political philosopher: for he is the architect of that
end with reference to which we call each matter either absolutely good
or absolutely evil. Moreover, it is indispensable to institute an
enquiry respecting them: for we have explained ethical virtue and vice
as referring to pleasures and pains: and most people affirm happiness to
 be coupled with pleasure: for which reason they have named &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;
&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;.”</p>
<p>
In Book VIII. 9-10, the &#963;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962; is indeed stated very clearly, but <i>not as such</i>
  — not as if Aristotle intended to make it serve as such, or thought
that it ought to form the basis upon which our estimate of what is the
proper middle point should be found. In viii. 9-10, he tells us that all
 justice and benevolence (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;) is a consequence and
an incident of established communion among human beings (&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;)  —
that the grand communion of all, which comprehends all the rest, is the <i>Political Communion</i>  — that the end and object of the <i>Political Communion</i>, as well that for which it was originally created as that for which it subsists and continues, is <i>the common and lasting advantage</i>
 (&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8135; &#963;&#973;&#956;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;)  — that all other communions, of relations,
friends, fellow-soldiers, neighbours, &amp;c., are portions of the
all-comprehensive political communion, and aim at realizing some partial
 advantage to the constituent members. These chapters are very clear and
 very important, and they announce plainly enough <i>the common and lasting interest</i>
 as the foundation and measure of justice as well as of benevolence. But
 they do not apply the same measure, to the qualities which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>had
 been enumerated in the Books prior to the Sixth, as a means of
ascertaining where the middle point is to be found which is alleged to
constitute virtue. Nevertheless, Aristotle tells us that it is in the
highest degree difficult to find the middle point which constitutes
virtue (ii. 9).</p>
<p>
It might seem at first sight not easy for Aristotle, consistently with
the plan of his treatise, to point out any such standard or measure. For
 none can be mentioned, with any tolerable pretensions to admissibility,
 except that of <i>tendency to promote happiness</i>  — the happiness
both of the individual agent and of the society to which he belongs. But
 as he had begun by introducing the ideas of reason and virtue as media
for explaining what happiness was, there would have been at least an
apparent incongruity in reverting back to the latter as a means of
clearing up what was obscure in the former. I say  — <i>at least an apparent incongruity</i>
  — because after all the incongruity is more apparent than real. If we
carefully preserve the distinction between the happiness of the
individual agent and the happiness of the Society to which he belongs,
it will appear that Aristotle might without any inconsistency have
specified the latter as being the object to which reason has regard, in
regulating and controlling the various affections of each individual.</p>
<p>
Wherein consists the happiness of an individual man? In a course of active exertion of the soul conformably to virtue: <i>virtue</i> being understood to consist in a certain mediocrity of our various affections as determined by <i>right reason</i>.</p>
<p>
When we next enquire, to what standard does <i>right reason</i> look in making this determination? it may without inconsistency be answered  — <i>Right reason</i> determines the proper point of mediocrity by a reference to <i>happiness generally</i>  — that is, to the happiness of society at large, including that of the individual agent in question  — in other words, to <i>the common and lasting advantage</i>,
 which Aristotle describes as the grand object of the statesman. There
is no inconsistency in reverting to happiness, thus explained, as the
standard by which right reason judges in controlling our different
affections.</p>
<p>
In all moral enquiries, it is of the greatest importance to keep in view
 the happiness of the individual, and the happiness of the society at
large, as two distinct and separate objects  — which coincide indeed &#8033;&#962;
&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;, in the majority of instances and with regard to the
majority of individuals  — but which do not coincide necessarily and
universally, nor with regard to every individual. A particular man may
be placed in such a position, or animated with such feelings, that his
happiness may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>promoted by doing what is contrary to the happiness of the society. He will under these circumstances do what is <i>good</i> for himself but <i>bad</i> for others: he will do what is morally wrong, and will incur the blame of society. In speaking of <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> it is always necessary to keep in mind, that what is <i>good</i> for an individual may be <i>bad</i> for the society: I mean, understanding the words <i>good for an individual</i>
 in the most comprehensive sense, as including all that he has to suffer
 from the unfavourable sentiments of society. Much confusion has arisen
from moralists speaking of good and evil absolutely, without specifying
whether they meant <i>good</i> for the individual or for the society: more particularly in the writings of the ancient philosophers.</p>
<p>
From the manner in which Aristotle arrives at his definition of what
constitutes happiness, we might almost suppose that he would have been
led to the indication of the happiness of society at large as the
standard for right reason to appeal to. For in examining what is the
proper business of man in general, he has recourse to the analogy of the
 various particular arts and professions  — the piper, the statuary, the
 carpenter, the carrier, &amp;c. Each has his particular business and
walk of action, and in the performance of that business consists <i>the good and the well</i>
 in his case (i. 7). So in like manner there is a special business for
man in general, in the performance of which we are to seek human good.</p>
<p>
Now this analogy of particular artists and professional men might have
conducted Aristotle to the idea of the general happiness of society as a
 standard. For the business of every artist or artisan consists in
conducing to the comfort, the protection, or the gratification of the
public, each in his particular walk: professional excellence for them
consists in accomplishing this object perfectly. For every special
profession therefore the happiness of society at large, under one form
or another, is introduced as the standard by which good and excellence
are to be measured.</p>
<p>
Apply this analogy to man in general, taken apart from any particular
craft or profession. If each man, considered simply as such, has his
appropriate business, in the good performance of which happiness for him
 consists, the standard of excellence in respect to such <span class="correction" title="amended from 'perforance'">performance</span>
 is to be found in its conduciveness to the happiness of society at
large. It can be found nowhere else, if we are to judge according to the
 analogy of special arts and professions.</p>
<p>
Until this want of a standard or measure is supplied, it is clear <span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>that
 the treatise of Aristotle is defective in a most essential point  — a
defect which is here admitted by himself in the first chapter of the
Sixth Book. Nor is there any other way of supplying what is wanting
except by reference to the general happiness of society, the end and
object (as he himself tells us) of the statesman.</p>
<p>
“What then,” says Aristotle,” prevents our calling him happy who is in
the active exercise of his soul agreeably to perfect virtue, and is
sufficiently well furnished with external goods, not for a casual period
 but for a complete lifetime?” (i. 10). He thinks himself obliged to
add, however, that this is not quite sufficient  — for that after death a
 man will still be affected with sympathy for the good or bad fortunes
and conduct of his surviving relatives, affected however faintly and
slightly, so as not to deprive him of the title to be called <i>happy</i>,
 if on other grounds he deserves it. The deceased person sees the
misfortunes of his surviving friends with something of the same kind of
sympathetic interest, though less in degree, as is felt by a living
person in following the representation of a tragedy (i. 11). The
difference between a misfortune, happening during a man’s life or after
his death, is much greater than that between scenic representation of
past calamities and actual reality (<i>ib.</i>).</p>
<p>
It seems as if Aristotle was reluctantly obliged to make this admission
 — that deceased persons were at all concerned in the calamities of the
living  — more in deference to the opinions of others than in
consequence of any conviction of his own. His language in the two
chapters wherein he treats of it is more than usually hesitating and
undecided: and in the beginning of Chapter XI., he says  — “To have no
interest whatever in the fortunes of their descendants and friends,
seems exceedingly heartless and contrary to what we should expect”  — he
 then, farther on, states it to be a great matter of doubt whether the
dead experience either good or evil  — but if anything of the kind does
penetrate to them, it must be feeble and insignificant, so as to make no
 sensible difference to them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>
Aristotle distributes <i>good things</i> into three classes  — the <i>admirable</i> or worshipful  — the <i>praiseworthy</i>  — the <i>potential</i>.</p>
<p>
1. <i>Good</i>  — as an End: that which is worthy of being honoured and venerated in itself and from its own nature, without regard <span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>to anything ulterior: that which comes up to our idea of perfection.</p>
<p>
2. <i>Good</i>  — as a means: that which is good, not on its own account
 nor in its own nature, but on account of certain ulterior consequences
which flow from it.</p>
<p>
3. <i>Good</i>  — as a means, but not a certain and constant means: that which produces <i>generally</i>, but <i>not always</i>,
 ulterior consequences finally good: that which, in order to produce
consequences in themselves good, requires to be coupled with certain
concomitant conditions.</p>
<p>
1. <i>Happiness</i> belongs to the first of these classes: it is put along with <i>the divine</i>, <i>the better</i>, <i>soul</i>, <i>intellect</i>, <i>the more ancient</i>, <i>the principle</i>, <i>the cause</i>, &amp;c. (Mag. Moral. i. 2). Such objects as these, we contemplate with awe and reverence.</p>
<p>
2. <i>Virtue</i> belongs to the second of the classes: it is good from
the acts to which it gives birth, and from the end (happiness) which
those acts, when sufficiently long continued, tend to produce.</p>
<p>
3. <i>Wealth</i>, <i>power</i>, <i>beauty</i>, <i>strength</i>, &amp;c.,
 belong to the third class: these are generally good because under most
circumstances they tend to produce happiness: but they may be quite
otherwise, if a man’s mind be so defectively trained as to dispose him
to abuse them.</p>
<p>
It is remarkable that this classification is not formally laid down and
explained, but is assumed as already well known and familiar, in the
Nicom. Ethics, i. 12: whereas it is formally stated and explained in the
 Magna Moralia, i. 2.</p>
<p>
<i>Praise</i>, according to Aristotle, “does not belong to the best things, but only to the second-best. The Gods are to be <i>macarised</i>, not <i>praised</i>:”
 the praise of the Gods must have reference to ourselves, and must be
taken in comparison with ourselves and our acts and capacities: and this
 is ridiculously degrading, when we apply it to the majesty of the Gods.
 In like manner the most divine and perfect men deserve to be macarised
rather than praised. “No man praises happiness, as he praises justice,
but <i>macarises</i> (<i>blesses</i>) it as something more divine and better.”</p>
<p>
Happiness is to be numbered amongst the perfect and worshipful objects  —
 it is the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; for the sake of which all of us do everything: and we
consider the principle and the cause of all good things to be something
divine and venerable (i. 12).</p>
<p>
Since then Happiness is the action of the soul conformably to perfect virtue, it is necessary to examine what human virtue <span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>is: and this is the most essential mark to which the true politician will direct his attention (i. 13).</p>
<p>
There are two parts of the soul  — the rational and the irrational.
Whether these two are divisible in fact, like the parts of the body, or
whether they are inseparable in fact, and merely susceptible of being
separately dealt with in reasoning, like the concavity and convexity of a
 circle, is a matter not necessary to be examined in the present
treatise. Aristotle speaks as if he considered this as really a doubtful
 point.</p>
<p>
Of the irrational soul, one branch is, the nutritive and vegetative
faculty, common to man with animals and plants. The virtue of this
faculty is not special to man, but common to the vegetable and animal
world: it is in fact most energetic during sleep, at the period when all
 virtue special to man is for the time dormant (i. 13).</p>
<p>
But the irrational soul has also another branch, the appetites, desires,
 and passions: which are quite distinct from reason, but may either
resist reason, or obey it, as the case may happen. It may thus in a
certain sense be said to partake of reason, which the vegetative and
nutritive faculty does not in any way. The virtue of this department of
the soul consists in its due obedience to reason, as to the voice of a
parent (i. 13).</p>
<p>
Human virtue, then, distributes itself into two grand divisions  —  1.
The virtue of the rational soul, or Intellectual Virtue. 2. The virtue
of the semi-rational soul, or Ethical Virtue.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the word <i>Excellence</i> more exactly corresponds to &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052;, than <i>Virtue</i>.</p>
<p>
Intellectual excellence is both generated and augmented by teaching and
experience. Ethical excellence by practical training. The excellence is
not natural to us: but we are susceptible of being trained, and the
training creates it. By training, according as it is either good or bad,
 all excellence is either created or destroyed: just as a man becomes a
good or a bad musician, according as he has been subjected to a good or a
 bad mode of practice.</p>
<p>
It is by doing the same thing many times that we acquire at last the
habit of doing it  — “For what things we have to learn to do, these we
learn by doing” (ii. 1): according as the things we are trained to do
are good or bad, we acquire good habits or bad habits. By building we
become builders, by playing on the harp we become harpers  — good or
indifferent, according to the way in which we have practised. All
legislators wish and attempt to make their citizens good, by means of
certain habits: some succeed in the attempt, others fail: and this is
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>difference
 between a good and a bad government. It is by being trained to do acts
of justice and courage that we become at last just and courageous  — “In
 one word, habits are generated by (a succession of) like operations:
for this reason it is the character of the operations performed which we
 ought chiefly to attend to: for according to the difference of these
will be the habits which ensue. It is therefore not a matter of slight
difference whether immediately from our earliest years we are <i>ethised</i> in one way or in another  — it makes a prodigious difference  — or rather, it makes the whole difference” (ii. 1).</p>
<p>
Uniform perseverance in action, then, creates a habit: but of what
nature is the required action to be? In every department of our nature,
where any good result is to be produced, we may be disappointed of our
result by two sorts of error: either an excess or on the side of defect.
 To work or eat too much, or too little, prevents the good effects of
training upon the health and strength: so with regard to temperance,
courage and the other virtues  — the man who is trained to fear
everything and the man who is trained to fear nothing, will alike fail
in acquiring the genuine habit of courage. The acquisition of the habit
makes the performance of the action easy: by a course of abstinent acts,
 we acquire the habit of temperance: and having acquired this habit, we
can with the greater ease perform the act of abstinence (ii. 2).</p>
<p>
The symptom which indicates that the habit has been perfectly acquired,
is the facility or satisfaction with which the act comes to be performed
 (ii. 3). The man who abstains from bodily pleasures, and who performs
this contentedly (&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179; &#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#969;&#957;), is the <i>temperate</i> man: the man who does the same thing but reluctantly and with vexation (&#7936;&#967;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;) is <i>intemperate</i>:
 the like with courage. Ethical excellence, or ethical badness, has
reference to our pleasures and pains: whenever we do any thing mean, or
shrink from any thing honourable, it is some pleasure or some pain which
 determines our conduct: for which reason Plato rightly prescribes that
the young shall be educated even from the earliest moment so as to give a
 proper direction to their pleasures and pains (ii. 3). By often
pursuing pleasure and pain under circumstances in which we ought not to
do so, we contract bad habits, by a law similar to that which under a
good education would have imparted to us good habits. Ethical virtue
then consists in such a disposition of our pleasures and pains as leads
to performance of the best actions. Some persons have defined it to
consist in apathy and imperturbability of mind: but this definition is
erroneous: the mind ought to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span>affected
 under proper circumstances (ii. 3). (This seems to be the same doctrine
 which was afterwards preached by the Stoic school.)</p>
<p>
There are three ingredients which determine our choice, <i>the honourable</i>  — <i>the expedient</i>  — <i>the agreeable</i>: and as many which occasion our rejection  — <i>the base</i>  — <i>the inexpedient</i>  — <i>the painful</i> or <i>vexatious</i>.
 In respect to all these three the good man judges rightly, the wicked
man wrongly, and especially in regard to the latter. Pleasure and pain
are familiar to us from our earliest childhood, and are ineffaceable
from human nature: all men measure and classify actions (&#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#964;&#8048;&#962;
 &#960;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;) by pleasure and pain: some men to a greater degree, others to a
 less degree.</p>
<p>
All ethical excellence, and all the political science, turns upon pleasure and pain (ii. 3).</p>
<p>
A man becomes just and temperate by doing just and temperate actions,
thus by degrees acquiring the habit. But how (it is asked) can this be
true? for if a man performs just and temperate actions, he must already
start by being just and temperate.</p>
<p>
The objection is not well founded. A man may do just and temperate
actions, and yet not be just and temperate. If he does them, knowing
what he does, intending what he does, and intending to do the acts for
their own sake, then indeed he is just and temperate, but not otherwise.
 The productions of art carry their own merit along with them: a work of
 art is excellent or defective, whatever be the state of mind of the
person who has executed it. But the acts of a man cannot be said to be
justly or temperately done, unless there be a certain state of mind
accompanying their performance by the doer: they may indeed be called
just and temperate acts, meaning thereby that they are such as a just
and temperate man would do, but the man who does them does not
necessarily deserve these epithets. It is only by frequent doing of acts
 of this class that a man can acquire the habit of performing them
intentionally and for themselves, in which consists the just and
temperate character. To know what such acts are, is little or nothing:
you must obey the precepts, just as you follow the prescriptions of a
physician. Many men think erroneously that philosophy will teach them to
 be virtuous, without any course of action adopted by themselves (ii.
4).</p>
<p>
Aristotle classifies the phenomena of the soul (the non-rational soul)
into three  — Passions  — Capacities or Faculties  — States. The first
are the occasional affections  — anger, fear, envy, joy, aversion  — “in
 short, everything that is accompanied by pleasure <span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>or
 pain” (ii. 5). The second are, the capacities of being moved by such
affections  — the affective faculties, if one may so call them (<i>ib.</i>
 So Eth. Eudem. ii. 2). The third are, those habits according to which
we are said to be well or ill disposed towards this or that particular
affection: to be disposed to violent anger or violent fear, is a bad
habit. Virtues and vices are neither affections, nor faculties, but
habits, either good or bad. This is the genus to which the virtues
belong (&#964;&#8183; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;  — Eth. Nic. ii. 5). Virtue is that habit from the
possession of which a man is called good, and by which he performs well
his appropriate function (ii. 6). It consists in a certain medium
between two extremes, the one of excess, the other of defect  — a medium
 not positive and absolute, but variable and having reference to each
particular person and each particular case  — neither exceeding nor
falling short of what is proper (ii. 6). All ethical virtue aims at the
attainment of this middle point in respect to our affections and actions
  — to exhibit each on the proper occasions, in the proper degree,
towards the proper persons, &amp;c. This middle point is but one, but
errors on both sides of it are numberless: it must be determined by
reason and by the judgment of the prudent man (ii. 6).</p>
<p>
Virtue therefore, according to its essence and generic definition (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;
&#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#943; &#7968;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;), is a <i>certain mediocrity</i>.</p>
<p>
But there are some actions and some affections which do not admit of
mediocrity, and which imply at once in their names evil and culpability
(ii. 6)  — such as impudence, envy, theft, &amp;c. Each of these names
implies in its meaning a certain excess and defect, and does not admit
of mediocrity: just as <i>temperance</i> and <i>courage</i> imply in their meaning the idea of mediocrity, and exclude both excess and defect.</p>
<p>
Aristotle then proceeds to apply his general doctrine  — that virtue or
excellence consists in a medium between two extremes, both defects  — to
 various different virtues. He again insists upon the extreme difficulty
 of determining where this requisite medium is, in each individual
instance: either excess or defect is the easy and natural course. In
finding and adhering to the middle point consists the <i>well</i>, the <i>rare</i>, the <i>praiseworthy</i>, the <i>honourable</i>
 (ii. 9). The extremes, though both wrong, are not always equally wrong:
 that which is the most wrong ought at any rate to be avoided: and we
ought to be specially on our guard against the seductions of pleasure (<i>ib.</i>), since our natural inclinations carry us in that direction.</p>
<p>
Aristotle so often speaks of the propriety of following <i>nature</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>and produces <i>nature</i>
 so constantly as an authority and an arbiter, that it seems surprising
to find him saying  — “We must be on our guard with reference to the
things whereto we ourselves are prone. For some of us are by nature
disposed towards some things, others towards others.”  — “But we must
drag ourselves away in the opposite direction” (ii. 9).</p>
<p>
There is a singular passage in the same chapter with respect to our
moral judgments. After having forcibly insisted on the extreme
difficulty of hitting the proper medium point of virtue, he says that a
man who commits only small errors on one side or on the other side of
this point, is not censured, but only he who greatly deviates from it  —
 he then proceeds  — “But it is not easy to define in general language
at what point a man becomes deserving of censure: nor indeed is it easy
to do this with regard to any other matter of perception. Questions of
this sort depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and the
judgment upon each <i>resides in our perception</i>” (ii. 9).</p>
<p>
The first five chapters, of the third Book of the Ethics, are devoted to
 an examination of various notions involved in our ideas of virtue and
vice  — <i>Voluntary</i> and <i>Involuntary</i>  — &#7953;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;  — <i>Ignorance</i>  — &#7940;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;  — Choice or resolution, consequent upon previous deliberation  — &#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;.</p>
<p>
Those actions are <i>involuntary</i>, which are done either by
compulsion, or through ignorance. An action is done by compulsion when
the proximate cause of it (or beginning  — &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052;) is something foreign to
 the will of the agent  — the agent himself neither concurring nor
contributing. Actions done from the fear of greater evils are of a mixed
 character, as where a navigator in a storm throws his goods overboard
to preserve the ship. Such actions as this, taken as a class, and apart
from particular circumstances, are what no one would do voluntarily: but
 in the particular circumstances of the supposed case, the action is
done voluntarily. Every action is <i>voluntary</i>, wherein the beginning of organic motion is, the will of the agent (iii. 1).</p>
<p>
Men are praised if under such painful circumstances they make a right
choice  — if they voluntarily undergo what is painful or dishonourable
for the purpose of accomplishing some great and glorious result (<i>ib.</i>):
 they are censured, if they shrink from this course, or if they submit
to the evil without some sufficient end. If a man is induced to do what
is unbecoming by the threat of evils surpassing human endurance, he is
spoken of with forbearance: though there are some crimes of such
magnitude as cannot be excused even by the greatest possible
apprehension of evil, such as death and torture. In such trying <span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span>circumstances, it is difficult to make a right choice, and still more difficult to adhere to the choice when it is made.</p>
<p>
What is done <i>through ignorance</i>, can never be said to be done <i>voluntarily</i>: if the agent shall be afterwards grieved and repentant for what he has done, it is <i>involuntary</i>. If he be not repentant, though he cannot be said to have done the deed <i>voluntarily</i>, yet neither ought it to be called involuntary.</p>
<p>
A distinction however is to be taken in regard to ignorance, considered as a ground for calling the action <i>involuntary</i>, and for excusing the agent. A man drunk or in a violent passion, misbehaves, <i>ignorantly</i> but not <i>through ignorance</i>:
 that is, ignorance is not the cause of his misbehaviour, but
drunkenness or rage. In like manner, every depraved person may be
ignorant of his true interest, or the rule which he ought to follow, but
 this sort of ignorance does not render his behaviour <i>involuntary</i>,
 nor entitle him to any indulgence. It must be ignorance with regard to
some particular circumstance connected with the special action which he
is committing  — ignorance of the person with whom, or the instrument
with which, or the subject matter in regard to which he is dealing.
Ignorance of this special kind, if it be accompanied with subsequent
sorrow and repentance, constitutes an action involuntary, and forms a
reasonable ground for indulgence (<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ii.'">iii.</span> 1).</p>
<p>
A <i>voluntary action</i>, then, is that of which the beginning is in
the agent  — he knowing the particular circumstances under which he is
acting. Some persons have treated actions, performed through passion or
through desire, as <i>involuntary</i>; but this is an error. If this
were true, neither children nor animals would be capable of voluntary
action. Besides, it is proper, on some occasions, to follow the dictates
 both of anger and of desire: and we cannot be said to act involuntarily
 in these cases when we do exactly what we ought to do. Moreover sins
from passions and sins from bad reasoning are alike voluntary or alike
involuntary: both of them ought to be avoided: and the nonrational
affections are just as much a part of human nature as reason is (<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ii.'">iii.</span> 1).</p>
<p>
Having explained the proper meaning of voluntary and involuntary as applied to actions, Aristotle proceeds to define <span class="gesp">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>
 (deliberate choice); which is most intimately connected with
excellence, and which indeed affords a better test of disposition than
actions themselves can do (<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ii.'">iii.</span> 2).</p>
<p>
All premeditated choice is voluntary, but all voluntary action is not
preconcerted. Children and animals are capable of voluntary action, but
not of preconcerted action: sudden deeds, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span>too,
 are voluntary, but not preconcerted. Premeditated choice is different
from desire  — from passion  — from wishing  — and from opinion. Desire
and passion are common to animals, who are nevertheless incapable of <i>deliberate preference</i>.
 The incontinent man acts from desire, but not from deliberate
preference: the continent man acts from deliberate preference, but not
from desire. Nor is premeditated choice the same as wishing: for we
often wish for what is notoriously impracticable or unattainable, but we
 do not deliberately prefer any such thing: moreover we <i>wish</i> for the end, but we <i>deliberately choose</i>
 the means conducting to the end. We wish to be happy: but it cannot
with propriety be said that we deliberately choose to be happy.
Deliberate choice has reference to what it is or seems in our own power
to achieve.</p>
<p>
Again, deliberate choice is not to be regarded as a simple modification
of opinion. Opinions extend to everything: deliberate choice belongs
exclusively to matters within our grasp. Opinion is either true or
false: deliberate choice is either good or evil. We are good or bad,
according to the turn which our deliberate choice takes: not according
to our opinions. We deliberately choose to seek something or to avoid
something, and our choice is praised when it falls upon what is proper:
the points upon which we form an opinion are, what such or such a thing
is, whom it will benefit, and how: and our opinion is praised when it
happens to be true. It often occurs, too, that men who form the truest
opinions are not the best in their deliberate preferences. Opinion may
precede or accompany every deliberate choice, but still the latter is
something distinct in itself. It is in fact a determination of the will,
 preceded by deliberate counsel, and thus including or presupposing the
employment of reason (<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ii.'">iii.</span>
 2). It is an appetency, determined by previous counsel, of some matter
within our means, either really or seemingly, to accomplish  —
&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#8005;&#961;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#966;’ &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; (<span class="correction" title="amended from 'ii.'">iii.</span> 3).</p>
<p>
It seems from the language of Aristotle that the various explanations of
 &#928;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; which he has canvassed and shown to be inadmissible, had all
 been advanced by various contemporary philosophers.</p>
<p>
&#928;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, or <i>deliberate preference</i>, includes the idea of <i>deliberation</i>.
 A reasonable man does not deliberate upon all matters  — he does not
deliberate respecting mathematical or physical truths, or respecting
natural events altogether out of his reach, or respecting matters of
pure accident, or even respecting matters of human design carried on by
distant foreign <span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>nations.
 He only deliberates respecting matters which are more or less within
his own agency and control: respecting matters which are not certain,
but of doubtful issue. He does not deliberate about the end, but about
the means towards the end: the end itself is commonly assumed, just as
the physician assumes the necessity of establishing good health and the
orator that of persuading his hearers. If there be more than one way of
accomplishing the end, he deliberates by which out of these several
means he can achieve it best and most easily: proceeding from the end
itself first to the proximate cause of that end, then to the cause
immediately preceding that cause, and so backwards until he arrives at
the primary cause, which is either an action of his own, within his own
means, or something requiring implements and assistance beyond his power
 to procure. This is a process of analysis, similar to that which is
pursued by geometricians in seeking the way of solving a problem: they
assume the figure with the required conditions to be constructed: they
then take it to pieces, following back the consequences of each separate
 condition which it has been assumed to possess. If by this way of
proceeding they arrive at some known truth, their problem is solved; if
they arrive at some known untruth, the problem is insoluble. That step
which is last arrived at in the analysis, is the first in the order of
production (iii. 3). When a man in carrying back mentally this
deliberative analysis arrives at something manifestly impracticable, he
desists from farther deliberation: if he arrives at something within his
 power to perform, he begins action accordingly. The subject of <i>deliberation</i>, and the subject of <i>deliberate preference</i>, are the same, but the latter represents the process as accomplished and the result of deliberation decided.</p>
<p>
We take counsel and deliberation (as has been said), not about the end,
but about the means or the best means towards the end assumed. We <i>wish for the end</i>
 (&#7969; &#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;  — iii. 4). Our wish is for good, real or
apparent: whether for the one or the other, is a disputed question.
Speaking generally, and without reference to peculiar idiosyncrasies,
the real good or <i>the good</i> is the object of human wishes: speaking
 with reference to any particular individual, it is his own supposed or
apparent good. On this matter, the virtuous man is the proper judge and
standard of reference: that which is really good appears good to him.
Each particular disposition has its own peculiar sentiment both of what
is honourable and of what is agreeable (iii. 4): the principal
excellence of the virtuous man is, that he in every variety of
circumstances perceives what is truly and genuinely <span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>529</span>good; whereas to most men, pleasure proves a deception, and appears to be good, not being so in reality.</p>
<p>
Both virtue and vice consists in <i>deliberate preference</i>, of one or
 of another course of action. Both therefore are voluntary and in our
own power: both equally so. It is not possible to refer virtuous conduct
 or vicious conduct to any other beginning except to ourselves: the man
is the cause of his own actions, as he is the father of his own
children. It is upon this assumption that all legal reward and
punishment is founded: it is intended for purposes of encouragement and
prevention, but it would be absurd to think either of encouraging or
preventing what is involuntary, such as the appetite of hunger and
thirst. A man is punished for ignorance, when he is himself the cause of
 his own ignorance, or when by reasonable pains he might have acquired
the requisite knowledge. Every man above the limit of absolute fatuity
(&#954;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#948;&#8135; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#964;&#959;&#965;) must know that any constant repetition of acts tends
 to form a habit: if then by repetition of acts he allows himself to
form a bad habit, it is his own fault. When once the bad habit is
formed, it is true that he cannot at once get rid of it: but the
formation of such a habit originally was not the less imputable to
himself (iii. 5). Defects of body also which we bring upon ourselves by
our own negligence or intemperance, bring upon us censure: if they are
constitutional and unavoidable, we are pitied for them. Some persons
seem to have contended at that time, that no man could justly be made
responsible for his bad conduct: because (they said) the end which he
proposed to himself was good or bad according to his natural
disposition, not according to any selection of his own. Aristotle seems
to be somewhat perplexed by this argument: nevertheless he maintains,
that whatever influence we may allow to original and uncontrollable
nature, still the formation of our habits is more or less under our own
concurrent control; and therefore the end which we propose to ourselves
being dependent upon those habits, is also in part at least dependent
upon ourselves (iii. 5)  — our virtues and our vices are both voluntary.</p>
<p>
The first five chapters of the third Book (in which Aristotle examines
the nature of &#964;&#8056; &#7953;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;, &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;, &#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &amp;c.)
ought perhaps to constitute a Book by themselves. They are among the
most valuable parts of the Ethics. He has now established certain points
 with regard to our virtues generally. </p>
<p>
1. They are mediocrities (&#956;&#949;&#963;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962;).</p>
<p>2. They are habits, generated by particular actions often repeated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span>3. When generated, they have a specific influence of their own in facilitating the performance of actions of the same class. </p>
<p>4. They are in our own power originally, and voluntary.</p>
<p>5. They are under the direction of right reason.</p>
<p>
It is to be observed that our actions are voluntary from the beginning
to the end  — the last of a number of repeated actions is no less
voluntary than the first. But our habits are voluntary only at the
beginning  — they cease to be voluntary after a certain time  — but the
permanent effect left by each separate repetition of the action is
inappreciable (iii. 5).</p>
<p>
Aristotle then proceeds to an analysis of the separate virtues  —
Courage, Temperance, Liberality, Magnificence, Magnanimity, Gentleness,
Frankness, Simplicity, Elegant playfulness, Justice, Equity, &amp;c. He
endeavours to show that each of these is a certain mediocrity  — excess
lying on one side of it, defect on the other.</p>
<p>
There are various passages of Aristotle which appear almost identical
with the moral doctrine subsequently maintained by the Stoic school: for
 example  — iii. 6  — “In like manner he ought not to fear penury, nor
sickness, nor in any way such things as arise not from moral baseness
nor are dependent on himself.”</p>
<p>
The courageous man is afraid of things such as it befits a man to fear,
but of no others: and even these he will make head against on proper
occasions, when reason commands and for the sake of <i>honour</i>, which
 is the end of virtue (iii. 7). To fear nothing, or too little, is
rashness or insanity: to fear too much, is timidity: the courageous man
is the mean between the two, who fears what he ought, when he ought, as
he ought, and with the right views and purposes (<i>ib.</i>). The &#956;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#8056;&#962;
 (adulterer) exposes himself often to great dangers for the purpose of
gratifying his passion: but Aristotle does not hold this to be courage.
Neither does he thus denominate men who affront danger from passion, or
from the thirst of revenge, or from a sanguine temperament  — there must
 be deliberate preference and a proper motive, to constitute courage  —
the motive of honour (iii. 8).</p>
<p>
The end of courage (says Aristotle) is in itself pleasant, but it is put
 out of sight by the circumstances around it: just as the prize for
which the pugilist contends is in itself pleasurable, but being of small
 moment and encompassed with painful accessories, it appears to carry
with it no pleasure whatever. Fatigue, and wounds and death are painful
to the courageous man  — death is indeed more painful to him, inasmuch
as his life is of more value: but still he voluntarily and knowingly
affronts these pains for the sake of honour.</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>531</span>This
is painful: “but pleasure is not to be anticipated in the exercise of
all the different virtues, except in so far as the attainment of the end
 is concerned” (iii. 9).</p>
<p>
(This is perfectly true: but it contradicts decidedly the remark which
Aristotle had made before in his first Book (i. 8) respecting the
inherent pleasure of virtuous agency.)</p>
<p>
Courage and Temperance are the virtues of the instincts (&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;
&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#957;  — iii. 10). Temperance is the observance of a rational medium
with respect to the pleasures of eating, drinking, and sex. Aristotle
seems to be inconsistent when he makes it to belong to those pleasures
in which animals generally partake (iii. 10); for other animals do not
relish intoxicating liquors: unless indeed these are considered as
ranking under drink generally. The temperate man desires these pleasures
 as he ought, when he ought, within the limits of what is honourable,
and having a proper reference to the amount of his own pecuniary means:
just as right reason prescribes (iii. 11). To pursue them more, is
excess: to pursue them less, is defect. There is however, in estimating
excess and defect, a certain tacit reference to the average dispositions
 of the many.</p>
<p>
“Wherefore the desires of the temperate man ought to harmonize with
reason; for the aim of both is the honourable. And the temperate man
desires what he ought, and as he ought, and when: and this too is the
order of reason” (iii. 12).</p>
<p>
All virtuous acts are to be <i>on account of the honourable</i>  — thus
Aristotle says that the donations of the &#7940;&#963;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; (prodigal) are not to be
 called liberal  — “Neither are their gifts liberal, for they are not
honourable, nor on account of this, nor as they ought to be” (iv. 1).
Again about the &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#8052;&#962; or <i>magnificent</i> man  — “Now the
magnificent man will expend such things on account of the honourable;
for this is a condition shared in by all the virtues: and still he will
do so pleasantly and lavishly” (iv. 2). On the contrary, the &#946;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#962; or
 <i>vulgar</i> man, who differs from the magnificent man in the way of &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8052; or <i>excess</i>, is said to spend  — “Not for the sake of the honourable, but for the purpose of making a display of his wealth” (iv. 2).</p>
<p>
With respect to those epithets which imply praise or blame, there is
always a tacit comparison with some assumed standard. Thus with regard
to the &#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962; (lover of honour), Aristotle observes  — “It is evident
 that, as the term ‘lover of such and such things’ is used in various
senses, we do not always apply ‘lover of honour’ to express the same
thing; but when we praise, we praise that ambition which is more than
most men’s, and blame that which is greater than it ought to be” (iv.
4).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>In the fifth Book, Aristotle proceeds to explain wherein consist <i>Justice</i> and <i>Injustice</i>.</p>
<p>
These words are used in two senses  — a larger sense and a narrower sense.</p>
<p>
In the larger sense, <i>just behaviour</i> is equivalent to the
observance of law, generally: unjust behaviour is equivalent to the
violation of law generally. But the law either actually does command, or
 may be understood to command, that we should perform towards others the
 acts belonging to each separate head of virtue: it either actually
prohibits, or may be understood to prohibit, us from performing towards
others any of the acts belonging to each separate head of vice. In this
larger sense, therefore, <i>justice</i> is synonymous generally with perfect virtue  — <i>injustice</i>, with perfect wickedness: there is only this difference, that <i>just</i> or <i>unjust</i> are expressions applied to behaviour in so far as it affects other persons besides the agent: whereas <i>virtuous</i> or <i>wicked</i> are expressions applied simply to the agent without connoting any such ulterior reference to other persons. <i>Just</i> or <i>unjust</i>,
 is necessarily towards somebody else: and this reference is implied
distinctly in the term. Virtuous and vicious do not in the force of the
term connote any such relations, but are employed with reference to the
agent simply  — “This justice then is perfect virtue; yet not
absolutely, but with reference to one’s neighbour.  — In one sense we
call those things <i>just</i> that are productive and preservative of happiness and its parts to the political communion” (v. 1).</p>
<p>
Justice in this sense, is the very fulness of virtue, because it denotes
 the actual exercise of virtuous behaviour towards others: “there are
many who behave virtuously in regard to their own personal affairs, but
who are incapable of doing so in what regards others” (<i>ib.</i>). For this reason, justice has been called by some <i>the good of another and not our own</i>
  — justice alone of all the virtues, because it necessarily has
reference to another: the just man does what is for the interest of some
 one else, either the magistrate, or the community (v. 1).</p>
<p>
<i>Justice</i> in the narrower sense, is that mode of behaviour whereby a
 man, in his dealings with others, aims at taking to himself his fair
share and no more of the common objects of desire: and willingly
consents to endure his fair share of the common hardships. <i>Injustice</i>
 is the opposite  — that by which a man tries to appropriate more than
his fair share of the objects of desire, while he tries to escape his
fair share of the objects of aversion. To aim at this unfair
distribution of the benefits of the society, either in one’s own favour
or in favour of any one else, is injustice in <i>the narrow sense</i> (v. 2).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>Justice in this narrower sense is divided into two branches  — 1. Distributive Justice. 2. Corrective Justice.</p>
<p>
Distributive Justice has reference to those occasions on which positive
benefits are to be distributed among the members of the community,
wealth and honours, &amp;c. (v. 2). In this case, the share of each
citizen is to be a share not absolutely of equality, but one
proportional to his personal worth (&#7936;&#958;&#943;&#945;&#957;): and it is in the estimation
of this personal worth that quarrels and dissension arise.</p>
<p>
<i>Corrective Justice</i> has reference to the individual dealings, or
individual behaviour, between man and man: either to the dealings
implying mutual consent and contract, as purchase, sale, loan, hire,
suretyship, deposit, &amp;c.: or such as imply no such mutual consent,  —
 such as are on the contrary proceedings either by fraud or by force  —
as theft, adultery, perjury, poisoning, assassination, robbery, beating,
 mutilation, murder, defamation, &amp;c.</p>
<p>
In regard to transactions of this nature, the citizens are considered as
 being all upon a par  — no account is taken of the difference between
them in point of individual worth. Each man is considered as entitled to
 an equal share of good and evil: and if in any dealings between man and
 man, one man shall attempt to increase his own share of good or to
diminish his own share of evil at the expense of another man, corrective
 justice will interpose and re-establish the equality thus improperly
disturbed. He who has been made to lose or to suffer unduly, must be
compensated and replaced in his former position: he who has gained
unduly, must be mulcted or made to suffer, so as to be thrown back to
the point from which he started. The judge, who represents this <i>corrective justice</i>, is a kind of mediator, and the point which he seeks to attain in directing redress, is <i>the middle point between gain and loss</i>
  — so that neither shall the aggressive party be a gainer, nor the
suffering party a loser  — “So that justice is a mean between a sort of
gain and loss in voluntary things,  — it is the having the same after as
 before” (v. 4). Aristotle admits that the words <i>gain</i> and <i>loss</i> are not strictly applicable to many of the transactions which come within the scope of interference from <i>corrective justice</i>  — that they properly belong to voluntary contracts, and are strained in order to apply them to acts of aggression, &amp;c. (<i>ib.</i>).</p>
<p>
The Pythagoreans held the doctrine that justice universally speaking
consisted in simple retaliation  — in rendering to another the precise
dealing which that other had first given. This definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>534</span>
 will not suit either for distributive justice or corrective justice:
the treatment so prescribed would be sometimes more, sometimes less,
than justice: not to mention that acts deserve to be treated differently
 according as they are intentional or unintentional. But the doctrine is
 to a certain extent true in regard to the dealings between man and man
(&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962;)  — if it be applied in the way of
general analogy and not with any regard to exact similarity  — it is of
importance that the man who has been well treated, and the man who has
been illtreated, should each show his sense of the proceeding by
returning the like usage: “for by proportionate requital the State is
held together” (v. 5). The whole business of exchange and barter, of
division of labour and occupation,  — the co-existence of those distinct
 and heterogeneous ingredients which are requisite to constitute the
political communion  — the supply of the most essential wants of the
citizens  — is all founded upon the continuance and the expectation of
this assured requital for acts done. Money is introduced as an
indispensable instrument for facilitating this constant traffic: it
affords a common measure for estimating the value of every service  —
“And thus if there were no possibility of retaliation, there would be no
 communion” (v. 5).</p>
<p>
Justice is thus a mediocrity  — or consists in a just medium  — between
two extremes, but not in the same way as the other virtues. The just man
 is one who awards both to himself and to every one else the proper and
rightful share both of benefit and burthen. Injustice, on the contrary,
consists in the excess or defect which lie on one side or the other of
this medium point (v. 5).</p>
<p>
<i>Distributive justice</i> is said by Aristotle to deal with individuals according to geometrical ratio; <i>corrective justice</i>, according to arithmetical proportion. <i>Justice</i>, strictly and properly so called, is <i>political justice</i>:
 that reciprocity of right and obligation which prevails between free
and equal citizens in a community, or between citizens who, if not
positively equal, yet stand in an assured and definite ratio one to the
other (v. 6). This relation is defined and maintained by law, and by
judges and magistrates to administer the law. Political justice implies a
 state of law  — a community of persons qualified by nature to obey and
sustain the law  — and a definite arrangement between the citizens in
respect to the alternation of command and obedience  — “For this is, as
we have said (&#7974;&#957;), according to law, and among those who can naturally
have law; those, namely, as we have said (&#7974;&#963;&#945;&#957;), who have an equality of
 ruling and being ruled.” As the law arises <span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>out
 of the necessity of preventing injustice, or of hindering any
individual from appropriating more than his fair share of good things,
so it is felt that any person invested with sovereign authority may and
will commit this injustice. Reason therefore is understood to hold the
sovereign authority, and the archon acts only as the guardian of the
reciprocal rights and obligations  — of the constitutional equality  —
between the various citizens: undertaking a troublesome duty and paid
for his trouble by honour and respect (v. 6).</p>
<p>
The relation which subsists between master and slave, or father and son,
 is not properly speaking that of justice, though it is somewhat
analogous. Both the slave, and the non-adult son, are as it were parts
of the master and father: there can therefore be no injustice on his
part towards them, since no one deliberately intends to hurt a part of
himself. Between husband and wife there subsists a sort of justice  — <i>household justice</i> (&#964;&#8056; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;)  — but this too is different from political justice (v. 6).</p>
<p>
Political justice is in part <i>natural</i>  — in part <i>conventional</i>. That which is <i>natural</i>
 is everywhere the same: that which is conventional is different in
different countries, and takes its origin altogether from positive and
special institution. Some persons think that <i>all</i> political
justice is thus conventional, and none natural: because they see that
rights and obligations (&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#945;) are everywhere changeable, and
nowhere exhibit that permanence and invariability which mark the
properties of natural objects. “This is true to a certain extent, but
not wholly true: probably among the Gods it is not true at all: but with
 us that which is natural is in part variable, though not in every case:
 yet there is a real distinction between what is natural and what is not
 natural. Both natural justice and conventional justice, are thus alike
contingent and variable: but there is a clear mode of distinguishing
between the two, applicable not only to the case of justice but to other
 cases in which the like distinction is to be taken. For by nature the
right hand is the stronger: but nevertheless it may happen that there
are ambidextrous men.  — And in like manner those rules of justice which
 are not natural, but of human establishment, are not the same
everywhere: nor indeed does the same mode of government prevail
everywhere, though there is but one mode of government which is
everywhere agreeable to nature  — the best of all” (v. 7).</p>
<p>
(The commentary of Andronicus upon this passage is clearer and more instructive than the passage of Aristotle itself: and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>it
 is remarkable as a distinct announcement of the principle of utility.
“Since both natural justice, and conventional justice, are changeable,
in the way just stated, how are we to distinguish the one of these
fluctuating institutions from the other? The distinction is plain. Each
special precept of justice is to be examined on its own ground to
ascertain whether it be for the advantage of all that it should be
maintained unaltered, or whether the subversion of it would occasion
mischief. If this be found to be the fact, the precept in question
belongs to natural justice: if it be otherwise, to conventional justice”
 (Andronic. Rh. v. c. 10).</p>
<p>
The just, and the unjust, being thus defined, a man who does, willingly
and knowingly, either the one or the other, acts justly or unjustly: if
he does it unwillingly or unknowingly, he neither acts justly nor
unjustly, except by accident  — that is, he does what is not essentially
 and in its own nature unjust, but is only so by accident (v. 8).
Injustice will thus have been done, but no unjust act will have been
committed, if the act be done involuntarily. The man who restores a
deposit unwillingly and from fear of danger to himself, does not act
justly, though he does what by accident is just: the man who, anxious to
 restore the deposit, is prevented by positive superior force from doing
 so, does not act unjustly, although he does what by accident is unjust.
 When a man does mischief, it is either done contrary to all reasonable
expectation, in such manner that neither he nor any one else could have
anticipated from his act the mischief which has actually ensued from it
(&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#962;), and in this case it is a pure misfortune (&#7936;&#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#945;): or he
does it without intention or foreknowledge, yet under circumstances in
which mischief might have been foreseen, and ought to have been
foreseen; in this case it is a fault (&#7937;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#945;): or he does it
intentionally and with foreknowledge, yet without any previous
deliberation, through anger, or some violent momentary impulse; in this
case it is an unjust act (&#7936;&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#956;&#945;), but the agent is not necessarily an <i>unjust or wicked</i> man for having done it: or he does it with intention and deliberate choice, and in this case he is an unjust and wicked man.</p>
<p>
The man who does a just thing, or an unjust thing, is not necessarily a
just or an unjust man. Whether he be so or not, depends upon the state
of his mind and intention at the time (v. 8).</p>
<p>
Equity, &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#8050;&#962;, is not at variance with justice, but is an
improvement upon justice. It is a correction and supplement to the
inevitable imperfections in the definitions of legal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>justice.
 The law wishes to comprehend all cases, but fails in doing so: the
words of its enactment do not fully and exactly express its real
intentions, but either something more or something less. When the
lawgiver speaks in general terms, a particular case may happen which
falls within the rule as he lays it down, but which he would not have
wished to comprehend if he had known how to avoid it. It is then
becoming conduct in the individual to whose advantage the law in this
special case turns, that he should refrain from profiting by his
position, and that he should act as the legislator himself would wish,
if consulted on the special case. The general rules laid down by the
legislator are of necessity more or less defective: in fact, the only
reason why everything is not determined by law, is, that there are some
matters respecting which it is impossible to frame a law (v. 10). Such
is the conduct of the equitable man  — “the man who refrains from
pushing his legal rights to the extreme, to the injury of others, but
who foregoes the advantage of his position, although the law is in his
favour” (&#8001; &#956;&#8052; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#959;&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#967;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7952;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#943;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;
&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#946;&#959;&#951;&#952;&#972;&#957;).</p>
<p>
A man may hurt himself, but he cannot act unjustly towards himself. No
injustice can be done to a man except against his own consent. Suicide
is by implication forbidden by the law: to commit suicide is wrong,
because a man in so doing acts unjustly towards the city, not towards
himself, which is impossible (v. 12).</p>
<p>
To act unjustly  — and to be the object of unjust dealing by others  —
are both bad: but which is the worst? It is the least of the two evils
to be the object of unjust dealing by others. Both are bad, because in
the one case a man gets more than his share, in the other less than his
share: in both cases the just medium is departed from. To act unjustly
is blameable, and implies wickedness: to be the object of unjust dealing
 by others is not blameable, and implies no wickedness: the latter is
therefore in itself the least evil, although by accident it may perhaps
turn out to be the greater evil of the two. In the same manner a
pleurisy is in itself a greater evil than a trip and a stumble: but by
accident it may turn out that the latter is the greater evil of the two,
 if it should occur at the moment when a man is running away from the
enemy, so as to cause his being taken prisoner and slain.</p>
<p>
The question here raised by Aristotle  — which is the greater evil  — to
 act unjustly or to be the object of unjust dealing  — had been before
raised by Plato in the Gorgias. Aristotle follows <span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>out
 his theory about virtue, whereby he makes it consist in the observance
of a medium point. The man that acts unjustly sins on one side of this
point, the object of unjust dealing misses it on the other side: the one
 is comparable to a man who eats or works too much for his health, the
other to a man who eats or works too little. The question is one which
could hardly arise, according to the view taken by modern ethical
writers of the principles of moral science. The two things compared are
not in point of fact commensurable. Looking at the question from the
point of view of the moralist, the person injured has incurred no moral
guilt, but has suffered more or less of misfortune: the unjust agent on
the contrary has suffered no misfortune  — perhaps he has reaped benefit
  — but at any rate he has incurred moral guilt. Society on the whole is
 a decided loser by the act: but the wrong done implies the suffering
inflicted: the act is considered and called <i>wrong</i> because it does
 inflict suffering, and for no other reason. It seems an inadmissible
question therefore, to ask which of the two is the greater evil  — the
suffering undergone by A  — or the wrong by which B occasioned that
suffering: at least so far as society is concerned.</p>
<p>
But the ancient moralists, in instituting this comparison, seem to have
looked, not at society, but at the two individuals  — the wrong doer and
 the wrong sufferer  — and to have looked at them too from a point of
view of their own. If we take the feelings of these two parties
themselves as the standard by which to judge, the sentence must be
obviously contrary to the opinion delivered by Aristotle: the sufferer,
according to his own feeling, is worse off than he was before: the doer
is better off. And it is for this reason that the act forms a proper
ground for judicial punishment or redress. But the moralist estimates
the condition of the two men by a standard of his own, not by the
feelings which they themselves entertain. He decides for himself that a
virtuous frame of mind is the primary and essential ingredient of
individual happiness  — a wicked frame of mind the grand source of
misery: and by this test he tries the comparative happiness of every
man. The man who manifests evidence of a guilty frame of mind is
decidedly worse off than he who has only suffered an unmerited
misfortune.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>
<h2>
<span class="smcap">POLITICA.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>The scheme of government proposed by Aristotle, in the two last books
 of his Politics, as representing his own ideas of something like
perfection, is evidently founded upon the Republic of Plato: from whom
he differs in the important circumstance of not admitting either
community of property or community of wives and children.</p>
<p>
Each of these philosophers recognises one separate class of inhabitants,
 relieved from all private toil and all money-getting employments, and
constituting exclusively the citizens of the commonwealth. This small
class is in effect <i>the city</i>  — <i>the commonwealth</i>: the
remaining inhabitants are not a part of the commonwealth, they are only
appendages to it  — indispensable indeed, but still appendages, in the
same manner as slaves or cattle (vii. 8). In the Republic of Plato this
narrow aristocracy are not allowed to possess private property or
separate families, but form one inseparable brotherhood. In the scheme
of Aristotle, this aristocracy form a distinct caste of private families
 each with its separate property. The whole territory of the State
belongs to them, and is tilled by dependent cultivators, by whom the
produce is made over and apportioned under certain restrictions. A
certain section of the territory is understood to be the common property
 of the body of citizens (<i>i.e.</i> of the aristocracy), and the
produce of it is handed over by the cultivators into a common stock,
partly to supply the public tables at which all the citizens with their
wives and families are subsisted, partly to defray the cost of religious
 solemnities. The remaining portion of the territory is possessed in
separate properties by individual citizens, who consume the produce as
they please (vii. 9): each citizen having two distinct lots of land
assigned to him, one near the outskirts of the territory, the other near
 the centre. This latter regulation also had been adopted by Plato in
the treatise de Legibus, and it is surprising to observe that Aristotle
himself had censured it, in his criticisms on that treatise, as
incompatible with a judicious and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>careful
 economy (ii. 3. 8). The syssitia or public tables are also adopted by
Plato, in conformity with the institutions actually existing in his time
 in Crete and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
The dependent cultivators, in Aristotle’s scheme, ought to be slaves,
not united together by any bond of common language or common country
(vii. 9, 9): if this cannot be, they ought to be a race of subdued
foreigners, degraded into periœci, deprived of all use of arms, and
confined to the task of labouring in the field. Those slaves who till
the common land are to be considered as the property of the collective
body of citizens: the slaves on land belonging to individual citizens,
are the property of those citizens.</p>
<p>
When we consider the scanty proportion of inhabitants whom Aristotle and
 Plato include in the benefits of their community, it will at once
appear how amazingly their task as political theorists is simplified.
Their <span class="correction" title="amended from 'commonweath'">commonwealth</span>
 is really an aristocracy on a very narrow scale. The great mass of the
inhabitants are thrust out altogether from all security and good
government, and are placed without reserve at the disposal of the small
body of armed citizens.</p>
<p>
There is but one precaution on which Aristotle and Plato rely for
ensuring good treatment from the citizens towards their inferiors: and
that is, the finished and elaborate education which the citizens are to
receive. Men so educated, according to these philosophers, will behave
as perfectly in the relation of superior to inferior, as in that of
equal to equal  — of citizen to citizen.</p>
<p>
This supposition would doubtless prove true, to a certain extent, though
 far short of that extent which would be requisite to assure the
complete comfort of the inferior. But even if it were true to the
fullest extent, it would be far from satisfying the demands of a
benevolent theorist. For though the inferior should meet with kindness
and protection from his superior, still his mind must be kept in a
degradation suitable to his position. He must be deprived of all moral
and intellectual culture: he must be prevented from imbibing any ideas
of his own dignity: he must be content to receive whatever is awarded,
to endure whatever treatment is vouchsafed, without for an instant
imagining that he has a right to benefits or that suffering is
wrongfully inflicted upon him. Both Plato and Aristotle acknowledge the
inevitable depravation and moral abasement of all the inhabitants
excepting their favoured class. Neither of them seems solicitous either
to disguise or to mitigate it.</p>
<p>
But if they are thus indifferent about the moral condition of the mass, they are in the highest degree exact and careful <span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span>respecting
 that of their select citizens. This is their grand and primary object,
towards which the whole force of their intellect, and the full fertility
 of their ingenious imagination, is directed. Their plans of education
are most elaborate and comprehensive: aiming at every branch of moral
and intellectual improvement, and seeking to raise the whole man to a
state of perfection, both physical and mental. You would imagine that
they were framing a scheme of public education, not a political
constitution: so wholly are their thoughts engrossed with the training
and culture of their citizens. It is in this respect that their ideas
are truly instructive.</p>
<p>
Viewed with reference to the general body of inhabitants in a State,
nothing can be more defective than the plans of both these great
philosophers. Assuming that their objects were completely attained, the
mass of the people would receive nothing more than that degree of
physical comfort and mild usage which can be made to consist with
subjection and with the extortion of compulsory labour.</p>
<p>
Viewed with reference to the special class recognized as citizens, the
plans of both are to a high degree admirable. A better provision is made
 for the virtue as well as for the happiness of this particular class
than has ever been devised by any other political projector. The
intimate manner in which Aristotle connects virtue with happiness, is
above all remarkable. He in fact defines happiness to consist in <i>the active exertion and perfected habit of virtue</i>
 (&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#967;&#961;&#8134;&#963;&#943;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962;  — vi. 9. 3.): and it is upon
this disposition that he founds the necessity of excluding the mass of
inhabitants from the citizenship. For the purpose to be accomplished by
the political union, is, the assuring of happiness to every individual
citizen, which is to be effected by implanting habits of virtue in every
 citizen. Whoever therefore is incapable of acquiring habits of virtue,
is disqualified from becoming a citizen. But every man whose life is
spent in laborious avocations, whether of husbandry, of trade, or of
manufacture, becomes thereby incapable of acquiring habits of virtue,
and cannot therefore be admitted to the citizenship. No man can be
capable of the requisite mental culture and tuition, who is not exempted
 from the necessity of toil, enabled to devote his whole time to the
acquisition of virtuous habits, and subjected from his infancy to a
severe and systematic training. The exclusion of the bulk of the people
from civil rights is thus founded, in the mind of Aristotle, on the
lofty idea which he forms of individual human perfection, which he
conceives to be absolutely unattainable unless it be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>made
 the sole object of a man’s life. But then he takes especial care that
the education of his citizens shall be really such as to compel them to
acquire that virtue on which alone their pre-eminence is built. If he
exempts them from manual or money-getting labours, he imposes upon them
an endless series of painful restraints and vexatious duties for the
purpose of forming and maintaining their perfection of character. He
allows no luxury or self-indulgence, no misappropriation of time, no
ostentatious display of wealth or station. The life of his select
citizens would be such as to provoke little envy or jealousy, among men
of the ordinary stamp. Its hard work and its strict discipline would
appear repulsive rather than inviting: and the pre-eminence of strong
and able men, submitting to such continued schooling, would appear well
deserved and hardly earned.</p>
<p>
Oligarchical reasoners in modern times employ the bad part of
Aristotle’s principle without the good. They represent the rich and
great as alone capable of reaching a degree of virtue consistent with
the full enjoyment of political privileges: but then they take no
precautions, as Aristotle does, that the men so preferred shall really
answer to this exalted character. They leave the rich and great to their
 own self-indulgence and indolent propensities, without training them by
 any systematic process to habits of superior virtue. So that the select
 citizens on this plan are at the least no better, if indeed they are
not worse, than the remaining community, while their unbounded <span class="correction" title="amended from 'indulgencies'">indulgences</span>
 excite either undue envy or undue admiration, among the excluded
multitude. The select citizens of Aristotle are both better and wiser
than the rest of their community: while they are at the same time so
hemmed in and circumscribed by severe regulations, that nothing except
the perfection of their character can appear worthy either of envy or
admiration. Though therefore these oligarchical reasoners concur with
Aristotle in sacrificing the bulk of the community to the pre-eminence
of a narrow class, they fail of accomplishing the end for which alone he
 pretends to justify such a sacrifice  — the formation of a few citizens
 of complete and unrivalled virtue.</p>
<p>
The arrangements made by Aristotle for the good government of his
aristocratical citizens among themselves, are founded upon principles of
 the most perfect equality. He would have them only limited in number,
for in his opinion, personal and familiar acquaintance among them all is
 essentially requisite to good government (vii. 4. 7). The principal
offices of the State are all to be held by the aged citizens: the
military duties are to be fulfilled by the younger citizens. The city
altogether, with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>territory
 appertaining to it, must be large enough to be &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#954;&#951;&#962;: but it must
not be so extensive as to destroy personal intimacy among the citizens. A
 very large body are, in Aristotle’s view, incapable of discipline or
regularity.</p>
<p>
To produce a virtuous citizen, <i>nature</i>, <i>habit</i>, and <i>reason</i>
 must coincide. They ought to be endued with virtues qualifying them
both for occupation and for leisure: with courage, self-denial
(&#954;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#945;), and fortitude, to maintain their independence: with justice
and temperance, to restrain them from abusing the means of enjoyment
provided for them: and with philosophy or the love of contemplative
wisdom and science, in order to banish ennui, and render the hours of
leisure agreeable to them (vii. 13. 17). They are to be taught that
their hours of leisure are of greater worth and dignity than their hours
 of occupation. Occupation is to be submitted to for the sake of the
quiet enjoyment of leisure, just as war is made for the sake of
procuring peace, and useful and necessary employments undertaken for the
 sake of those which are honourable (vii. 13. 8). Aristotle greatly
censures (see vii. 2. 5) (as indeed Plato had done before him) the
institutions of Lacedæmon, as being directed exclusively to create
excellent warriors, and to enable the nation to rule over foreigners.
This (he says) is not only not the right end, but is an end absolutely
pernicious and culpable. To maintain a forcible sovereignty over free
and equal foreigners, is unjust and immoral: and if the minds of the
citizens be corrupted with this collective ambition and love of power,
it is probable that some individual citizen, taught by the education of
the State to consider power as the first of all earthly ends, will find
an opportunity to aggrandize himself by force or fraud, and to establish
 a tyranny over his countrymen themselves (viii. 13. 13). The
Lacedæmonians conducted themselves well and flourished under their
institutions, so long as they were carrying on war for the enlargement
of their dominion: but they were incapable of tasting or profiting by
peace: they were not educated by their legislator so as to be able to
turn leisure to account (&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#948;’ &#8001; &#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962;, &#959;&#8016; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
&#963;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;  — vii. 13. 15).</p>
<p>
The education of the citizen is to commence with the body: next the
irrational portion of the soul is to be brought under discipline  — that
 is, the will and the appetites, the concupiscent and irascible
passions: thirdly, the rational portion of the soul is to be cultivated
and developed. The habitual desires are to be so moulded and tutored as
to prepare them for the sovereignty of reason, when the time shall
arrive for bringing reason into action (vii. 13. 23). They are to learn
nothing until five years <span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>old
 (vii. 15. 4), their diversions are to be carefully prepared and
presented to them, consisting generally of a mimicry of subsequent
serious occupations (vii. 15. 15): and all the fables and tales which
they hear recited are to be such as to pave the way for moral discipline
 (<i>ib.</i>); all under the superintendence of the Pædonom. No obscene
or licentious talk is to be tolerated in the city (vii. 15. 7), nor any
indecent painting or statue, except in the temples of some particular
Deities. No youth is permitted to witness the recitation either of
iambics or of comedy (vii. 15. 9), until he attains the age which
qualifies him to sit at the public tables. Immense stress is laid by the
 philosopher on the turn of ideas to which the tender minds of youth
become accustomed, and on the earliest combinations of sounds or of
visible objects which meet their senses (vii. 15. 10). &#928;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#962;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7939; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962;

 1. 2).</p>
<p>
All the citizens in Aristotle’s republic are to be educated according to
 one common system: each being regarded as belonging to the commonwealth
 more than to his own parents. This was the practice at Lacedæmon, and
Aristotle greatly eulogizes it (viii. 1. 3).</p>
<p>
Aristotle does not approve of extreme and violent bodily training, such
as would bring the body into the condition of an athlete: nor does he
even sanction the gymnastic labours imposed by the Lacedæmonian system,
which had the effect of rendering the Spartans “brutal of soul,” for the
 purpose of exalting their courage (&#959;&#7985; &#923;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#962;  — &#952;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#974;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;
 &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#8033;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#956;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#963;&#973;&#956;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;). He remarks,
first, that courage is not the single or exclusive end to be aimed at in
 a civil education: next, that a savage and brutal soul is less
compatible with exalted courage than a gentle soul, trained so as to be
exquisitely sensible to the feelings of shame and honour (viii. 3. 3-5).
 The most sanguinary and unfeeling among the barbarous tribes, he
remarks, were very far from being the most courageous. A man trained on
the Lacedæmonian system, in bodily exercises alone, destitute even of
the most indispensable mental culture (see below), was a real &#946;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#962;  —
 useful only for one branch of political duties, and even for that less
useful than if he had been trained in a different manner.</p>
<p>
Up to the age of 14, Aristotle prescribes (&#7973;&#946;&#951; means 14 years of age  —
see vii. 15. 11) that boys shall be trained in gentle and regular
exercises, without any severe or forced labour. From 14 to 17 they are
to be instructed in various branches of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>545</span>knowledge:
 after 17, they are to be put to harder bodily labour and to be
nourished with a special and peculiar diet (&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962;). For how long
 this is to continue, is not stated. But Aristotle insists on the
necessity of not giving them at the same time intellectual instruction
and bodily training, for the one of these, he says, counteracts and
frustrates the other (viii. 4. 2-3).</p>
<p>
The Lacedæmonians made music no part of their education: Isocrat.
Panathen. Or. xii. p. 375, B.; they did not even learn ‘letters’
(&#947;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;), but they are said to have been good judges of music (viii.
4. 6). Aristotle himself however seems to think it next to impossible
that men who have not learned music can be good judges (viii. 6. 1).</p>
<p>
Aristotle admits that music may be usefully learnt as an innocent
pleasure and relaxation: but he chiefly considers it as desirable on
account of its moral effects, on the dispositions and affections. A
right turn of the pleasurable and painful emotions is, in his opinion,
essential to virtue: particular strains and particular rhythms are
naturally associated with particular dispositions of mind: by early
teaching, those strains and those rhythms which are associated with
temperate and laudable dispositions may be made more agreeable to a
youth than any others. He will like best those which he hears earliest,
and which he finds universally commended and relished by those about
him. A relish for the &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; of virtuous dispositions will tend to
increase in him the love of virtue itself (viii. 6. 5. 8).</p>
<p>
Aristotle enjoins that the youth be taught to execute music
instrumentally and vocally, because it is only in this way that they can
 acquire a good taste or judgment in music: besides which, it is
necessary to furnish boys with some occupation, to absorb their restless
 energies, and there is none more suitable than music. Some persons
alleged that the teaching music as a manual art was banausic and
degrading, lowering the citizen down to the station of a hired
professional singer. Aristotle meets this objection by providing that
youths shall be instructed in the musical art, but only with the view of
 correcting and cultivating their taste: they are to be forbidden from
making any use of their musical acquisitions, in riper years, in actual
playing or singing (viii. 6. 3). Aristotle observes, that music more
difficult of execution had been recently introduced into the agones, and
 had found its way from the agones into the ordinary education. He
decidedly disapproves and excludes it (viii. 6. 4). He forbids both the
flute and the harp, and every other instrument requiring much art to
play upon it: especially the flute, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>546</span>which
 he considers as not ethical, but orgiastical  — calculated to excite
violent and momentary emotions. The flute obtained a footing in Greece
after the Persian invasion; in Athens at that time it became especially
fashionable; but was discontinued afterwards (Plutarch alleges, through
the influence of Alcibiades).</p>
<p>
The suggestions of Aristotle for the education of his citizens are far
less copious and circumstantial than those of Plato in his Republic. He
delivers no plan of study, no arrangement of sciences to be successively
 communicated, no reasons for preferring or rejecting. We do not know
what it was precisely which Aristotle comprehended in the term
“philosophy,” intended by him to be taught to his citizens as an aid for
 the proper employment of their leisure. It must probably have included
the moral, political, and metaphysical sciences, as they were then known
  — those sciences to which his own voluminous works relate.</p>
<p>
By means of the public table, supplied from the produce of the public
lands, Aristotle provides for the full subsistence of every citizen. Yet
 he is well aware that the citizens will be likely to increase in
numbers too rapidly, and he suggests very efficient precautions against
it. No child at all deformed or imperfect in frame is to be brought up:
children beyond a convenient number, if born, are to be exposed: but
should the law of the State forbid such a practice, care must be taken
to forestall consciousness and life in them, and to prevent their birth
by &#7940;&#956;&#946;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; (vii. 14. 10).</p>
<p>
Aristotle establishes two <i>agora</i> in his city: one situated near to
 the harbour, adapted to the buying, selling, and storing of goods,
under the surveillance of the agoranomus: the other called the <i>free agora</i>,
 situated in the upper parts of the city, set apart for the amusement
and conversation of the citizens, and never defiled by the introduction
of any commodities for sale. No artisan or husbandman is ever to enter
the latter unless by special order from the authorities. The temples of
the Gods, the residences of the various boards of government
functionaries, the gymnasia of the older citizens, are all to be erected
 in this free agora (vii. 11). The Thessalian cities had an agora of
this description where no traffic or common occupations were permitted.</p>
<p>
The moral tendency of Aristotle’s reflections is almost always useful
and elevating. The intimate union which he formally recognizes and
perpetually proclaims between happiness and virtue, is salutary and
instructive: and his ideas of what virtue is, are perfectly just, so far
 as relates to the conduct of his citizens towards each other: though
they are miserably defective <span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>as
 regards obligation towards non-citizens. He always assigns the proper
pre-eminence to wisdom and virtue: he never overvalues the advantages of
 riches, nor deems them entitled on their own account, to any reverence
or submission: he allows no title to the obedience of mankind, except
that which arises from superior power and disposition to serve them.
Superior power and station, as he considers them, involve a series of
troubles  — some obligations which render them objects of desire only to
 men of virtue and beneficence. What is more rare and more creditable
still, he treats all views of conquest and aggrandizement by a State as
immoral and injurious, even to the conquerors themselves.</p>

<h2>
<span class="smcap">THE DOCTRINE OF UNIVERSALS.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>The controversy respecting Universals first obtained its place in
philosophy from the colloquies of Sokrates, and the writings and
teachings of Plato. We need not here touch upon their predecessors,
Parmenides and Herakleitus, who, in a confused and unsystematic manner,
approached this question from opposite sides, and whose speculations
worked much upon the mind of Plato in determining both his aggressive
dialectic, and his constructive theories. Parmenides of Elea, improving
upon the ruder conceptions of Xenophanes, was the first to give emphatic
 proclamation to the celebrated Eleatic doctrine, Absolute Ens as
opposed to Relative Fientia: <i>i.e.</i> the Cogitable, which Parmenides
 conceived as the One and All of reality, &#7955;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#8118;&#957;, enduring and
unchangeable, of which the negative was unmeaning, — and the Sensible or
 Perceivable, which was in perpetual change, succession and
multiplicity, without either unity, or reality, or endurance. To the
last of these two departments Herakleitus assigned especial prominence.
In place of the permanent underlying Ens, which he did not recognize, he
 substituted a cogitable process of <i>change</i>, or generalized
concept of what was common to all the successive phases of change — a
perpetual stream of generation and destruction, or implication of
contraries, in which everything appeared only that it might disappear,
without endurance or uniformity. In this doctrine of Herakleitus, the
world of sense and particulars could not be the object either of certain
 knowledge or even of correct probable opinion; in that of Parmenides,
it was recognized as an object of probable opinion, though not of
certain knowledge. But in both doctrines, as well as in the theories of
Demokritus, it was degraded, and presented as incapable of yielding
satisfaction to the search of a philosophizing mind, which could find
neither truth nor reality except in the world of Concepts and
Cogitables.</p>
<p>
Besides the two theories above-mentioned, there were current in the
Hellenic world, before the maturity of Sokrates, several other veins of
speculation about the Kosmos, totally divergent one from the other, and
by that very divergence sometimes stimulating curiosity, sometimes
discouraging all study as though the problems were hopeless. But
Parmenides and Herakleitus, together with the arithmetical and
geometrical hypotheses of the Pythagoreans, are expressly noticed by
Aristotle as having specially contributed to form the philosophy of
Plato. </p>
<p>
Neither Parmenides, nor Herakleitus, nor the Pythagoreans were
dialecticians. They gave out their own thoughts in their own way, with
little or no regard to dissentients. They did not cultivate the art of
argumentative attack or defence, nor the correct application and
diversified confrontation of universal terms, which are the great
instruments of that art. It was Zeno, the disciple of Parmenides, that
first employed dialectic in support of his master’s theory, or rather
against the counter-theories of opponents. He showed by arguments
memorable for their subtlety, that the hypothesis of an Absolute,
composed of Entia Plura Discontinua, led to consequences even more
absurd than those that opponents deduced from the Parmenidean hypothesis
 of Ens Unum Continuum. The dialectic, thus inaugurated by Zeno, reached
 still higher perfection in the colloquies of Sokrates; who not only
employed a new method, but also introduced new topics of debate —
ethical, political, and social matters instead of physical things and
the Kosmos. </p>
<p>
The peculiar originality of Sokrates is well known: a man who wrote
nothing, but passed his life in indiscriminate colloquy with every one;
who professed to have no knowledge himself, but interrogated others on
matters that they talked about familiarly and professed to know well;
whose colloquies generally ended by puzzling the respondents, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>by
 proving to themselves that they neither knew nor could explain even
matters that they had begun by affirming confidently as too clear to
need explanation. Aristotle tells us<a name="FnAnchor15_1" href="#Footnote15_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 that Sokrates was the first that set himself expressly and methodically
 to scrutinize the definitions of general or universal terms, and to
confront them, not merely with each other, but also, by a sort of
inductive process, with many particular cases that were, or appeared to
be, included under them. And both Xenophon and Plato give us abundant
examples of the terms to which Sokrates applied his interrogatories:
What is the Holy? What is the Unholy? What is the Beautiful or
Honourable? What is the Ugly or Base? What is Justice-Injustice —
Temperance — Madness — Courage — Cowardice — A City — A man fit for
civil life? What is the Command of Men? What is the character fit for
commanding men? Such are the specimens, furnished by a hearer,<a name="FnAnchor15_2" href="#Footnote15_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 of the universal terms whereon the interrogatories of Sokrates bore.
All of them were terms spoken and heard familiarly by citizens in the
market-place, as if each understood them perfectly; but when Sokrates,
professing his own ignorance, put questions asking for solutions of
difficulties that perplexed his own mind, the answers showed that these
difficulties were equally insoluble by respondents, who had never
thought of them before. The confident persuasion of knowledge, with
which the colloquy began, stood exposed as a false persuasion without
any basis of reality. Such illusory semblance of knowledge was
proclaimed by Sokrates to be the chronic, though unconscious,
intellectual condition of his contemporaries. How he undertook, as the
mission of a long life, to expose it, is impressively set forth in the
Platonic Apology.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_1" id="Footnote15_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_1">1</a></span> Metaphysica, <span class="smcap">A.</span> p. 987, b. 2; <span class="smcap">M.</span> p. 1078, b. 18.</p></div>

<p>
It was thus by Sokrates that the meaning of universal terms and
universal propositions, and the relation of each respectively to
particular terms and particular propositions were first made a subject
of express enquiry and analytical interrogation. His influence was
powerful in imparting the same dialectical impulse to several
companions; but most of all to Plato, who not only enlarged and
amplified the range of Sokratic enquiry, but also brought the meaning of
 universal terms into something like system and theory, as a portion of
the conditions of trustworthy science. Plato was the first to affirm the
 doctrine afterwards called Realism, as the fundamental postulate of all
 true and proved cognition. He affirmed it boldly, and in its most
extended sense, though he also produces (according to his frequent
practice) many powerful arguments and unsolved objections against it. It
 was he (to use the striking phrase of Milton<a name="FnAnchor15_3" href="#Footnote15_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>)
 that first imported into the schools the portent of Realism. The
doctrine has been since opposed, confuted, curtailed, transformed,
diversified in many ways; but it has maintained its place in logical
speculation, and has remained, under one phraseology or another, the
creed of various philosophers, from that time down to the present.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_3" id="Footnote15_3"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_3">3</a></span> See the Latin verses ‘De Ideâ Platonicâ quemadmodum Aristoteles intellexit’ — </p>

<p>
The following account of the problems of Realism was handed down to the
speculations of the mediæval philosophers by Porphyry (between 270-300 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>),
 in his Introduction to the treatise of Aristotle on the Categories.
After informing Chrysaorius that he will prepare for him a concise
statement of the doctrines of the old philosophers respecting Genus,
Differentia, Species, Proprium, Accidens, “abstaining from the deeper
enquiries, but giving suitable development to the more simple,” —
Porphyry thus proceeds:— “For example, I shall decline discussing, in
respect to Genera and Species, (1) Whether they have a substantive
existence, or reside merely in naked mental conceptions; (2) Whether,
assuming them to have substantive existence, they are bodies or
incorporeals; (3) Whether their substantive existence is in and along
with the objects of sense, or apart and separable. Upon this task I
shall not enter, since it is of the greatest depth, and requires another
 larger investigation; but shall try at once to show you how the
ancients (especially the Peripatetics), with a view to logical
discourse, dealt with the topics now propounded.”<a name="FnAnchor15_4" href="#Footnote15_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_4" id="Footnote15_4"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_4">4</a></span> Porphyry, Introd. in Categor. init. p. 1, a. 1, Schol. Br.</p></div>
<p>
Before Porphyry, all these three problems had been largely debated,
first by Plato, next by Aristotle against Plato, again by the Stoics
against both, and lastly by Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists as
conciliators of Plato with Aristotle. After Porphyry, problems the same,
 or similar, continued to stand in the foreground of speculation, until
the authority of Aristotle became discredited at all points by the
influences of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But in order to
find the beginning of them, as questions provoking curiosity and opening
 dissentient points of view to inventive <span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span>dialecticians, we must go back to the age and the dialogues of Plato.</p>
<p>
The real Sokrates (<i>i.e.</i> as he is described by Xenophon)
inculcated in his conversation steady reverence for the invisible, as
apart from and overriding the phenomena of sensible experience; but he
interpreted the term in a religious sense, as signifying the agency of
the personal gods, employed to produce effects beneficial or injurious
to mankind.<a name="FnAnchor15_5" href="#Footnote15_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 He also puts forth his dialectical acuteness to prepare consistent and
tenable definitions of familiar general terms (of which instances have
already been given), at least so far as to make others feel, for the
first time, that they did not understand these terms, though they had
been always talking like persons that <i>did</i> understand. But the Platonic Sokrates (<i>i.e.</i>
 as spokesman in the dialogues of Plato) enlarges both these discussions
 materially. Plato recognizes, not simply the invisible persons or gods,
 but also a separate world of invisible, impersonal entities or objects;
 one of which he postulates as the objective reality, though only a
cogitable reality, correlating with each general term. These Entia he
considers to be not merely distinct realities, but the only true and
knowable realities: they are eternal and unchangeable, manifested by the
 fact that particulars partake in them, and imparting a partial show of
stability to the indeterminate flux of particulars: unless such separate
 Universal Entia be supposed, there is nothing whereon cognition can
fasten, and consequently there can be no cognition at all.<a name="FnAnchor15_6" href="#Footnote15_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 These are the substantive, self-existent Ideas, or Forms that Plato
first presented to the philosophical world; sometimes with logical
acuteness, oftener still with rich poetical and imaginative colouring.
They constitute the main body and characteristic of the hypothesis of
Realism.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_5" id="Footnote15_5"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_5">5</a></span> Xenophon, Memorab. I. iv. 9-17; IV. iii. 14.</p></div>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_6" id="Footnote15_6"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_6">6</a></span> Aristot. Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span> vi. p. 987, b. 5; <span class="smcap">M.</span> iv. p. 1078, b. 15.</p></div>
<p>
But, though the main hypothesis is the same, the accessories and manner
of presentation differ materially among its different advocates. In
these respects, indeed, Plato differs not only from others, but also
from himself. Systematic teaching or exposition is not his purpose, nor
does he ever give opinions in his own name. We have from him an
aggregate of detached dialogues, in many of which this same hypothesis
is brought under discussion, but in each dialogue, the spokesmen
approach it from a different side; while in others (distinguished by
various critics as the Sokratic dialogues) it does not come under
discussion at all, Plato being content to remain upon the Sokratic
platform, and to debate the meaning of general terms without postulating
 in correlation with them an objective reality, apart from their
respective particulars.</p>
<p>
At the close of the Platonic dialogue called Kratylus, Sokrates is
introduced as presenting the hypothesis of self-existent, eternal,
unchangeable Ideas (exactly in the way that Aristotle ascribes to Plato)
 as the counter-proposition to the theory of universal flux and change
announced by Herakleitus. Particulars are ever changing (it is here
argued) and are thus out of the reach of cognition; but, unless the
Universal Ideas above them, such as the Self-beautiful, the Self-good,
&amp;c., be admitted as unchangeable, objective realities, there can be
nothing either nameable or knowable: cognition becomes impossible.</p>
<p>
In the Timæus, Plato describes the construction of the Kosmos by a
Divine Architect, and the model followed by the latter in his work. The
distinction is here again brought out, and announced as capital, between
 the permanent, unalterable Entia, and the transient, ever-fluctuating
Fientia, which come and go, but never really <i>are</i>. Entia are
apprehended by the cogitant or intelligent soul of the Kosmos, Fientia
by the sentient or percipient soul; the cosmical soul as a whole, in
order to suffice for both these tasks, is made up of diverse component
elements — Idem, correlating with the first of the two, Diversum,
correlating with the second, and Idem implicated with Diversum,
corresponding to both in conjunction. The Divine Architect is described
as constructing a Kosmos, composed both of soul and body, upon the
pattern of the grand pre-existent Idea — &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; or the Self-Animal;
which included in itself as a genus the four distinct species —
celestial (gods, visible and invisible), terrestrial, aerial, and
aquatic.</p>
<p>
The main point that Plato here insists upon is — the eternal and
unchangeable reality of the cogitable objects called Ideas, prior both
in time and in logical order to the transient objects of sight and
touch, and serving as an exemplar to which these latter are made to
approximate imperfectly. He assumes such priority, without proof, in the
 case of the Idea of Animal; but, when he touches upon the four elements
 — Fire, Air, Water, Earth — he hesitates to make the same assumption,
and thinks himself required to give a reason for it. The reason that he
assigns (announced distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
 as his own) is as follows: If Intellection (Cogitation, &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) and true
Opinion are two genera distinct from each other, there must clearly
exist Forms or Ideas imperceptible to our senses, and apprehended only
by cogitation or intellection; but if, as some persons think, true
opinion is noway different from intellection, then we must admit all the
 objects perceived by our senses as firm realities. Now the fact is (he
proceeds to say) that true opinion is not identical with intellection,
but quite distinct, separate, and unlike to it. Intellection is
communicated by teaching, through true reasoning, and is unshakeable by
persuasion; true opinion is communicated by persuasion and removed by
counter-persuasion, without true reasoning. True opinion may belong to
any man; but intellection is the privilege only of gods and of a small
section of mankind. Accordingly, since the two are distinct, the objects
 correlating with each of them must also be distinct from each other.
There must exist, first, primary, eternal, unchangeable Forms,
apprehended by intellect or cogitation, but imperceptible by sense; and,
 secondly, resemblances of these bearing the same name, generated and
destroyed each in some place, and apprehended first by sense, afterwards
 by opinion. Thirdly, there must be the place wherein such resemblances
are generated; a place itself imperceptible by sense, yet postulated, as
 a receptacle indispensable for them, by a dreamy kind of computation.</p>
<p>
We see here that the proof given by Plato, in support of the existence
of Forms as the primary realities, is essentially psychological: resting
 upon the fact that there is a distinct mental energy or faculty called
Intellection (apart from Sense and Opinion), which must have its
distinct objective correlate; and upon the farther fact, that
intellection is the high prerogative of the gods, shared only by a few
chosen men. This last point of the case is more largely and emphatically
 brought out in the Phædrus, where Sokrates delivers a highly poetical
effusion respecting the partial intercommunion of the human soul with
these eternal intellectual realities. To contemplate them is the
constant privilege of the gods; to do so is also the aspiration of the
immortal soul of man generally, in the pre-existent state, prior to
incorporation with the human body; though only in a few cases is such
aspiration realized. Even those few human souls, that have succeeded in
getting sight of the intellectual Ideas (essences without colour,
figure, or tactile properties), lose all recollection of them when first
 entering into partnership with a human body; but are enabled gradually
to recall them, by combining repeated impressions and experience of
their resemblances in the world of sense. The revival of these divine
elements is an inspiration of the nature of madness; though it is a
variety of madness as much better than uninspired human reason as other
varieties are worse. The soul, becoming insensible to ordinary pursuits,
 contracts a passionate devotion to these Universal Ideas, and to that
dialectical communion, especially with some pregnant youthful mind, that
 brings them into clear separate contemplation disengaged from the
limits and confusion of sense.</p>
<p>
Here philosophy is presented as the special inspiration of a few, whose
souls during the period of pre-existence have sufficiently caught sight
of the Universal Ideas or Essences; so that these last, though overlaid
and buried when the soul is first plunged in a body, are yet revivable
afterwards under favourable circumstances, through their imperfect
copies in the world of sense; especially by the sight of personal beauty
 in an ingenuous and aspiring youth, in which case the visible copy
makes nearest approach to the perfection of the Universal Idea or Type.
At the same time, Plato again presents to us the Cogitable Universals as
 the only objects of true cognition, the Sensible Particulars being
objects merely of opinion.</p>
<p>
In the Phædon, Sokrates advances the same doctrine, that the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'preceptions'">perceptions</span>
 of sense are full of error and confusion, and can at best suggest
nothing higher than opinion; that true cogitation can never be attained
except when the cogitant mind disengages itself from the body and comes
into direct contemplation of the Universal Entia, objects eternal and
always the same — The Self-beautiful, Self-good, Self-just, Self-great,
Healthy, Strong, &amp;c., all which objects are invisible, and can be
apprehended only by the cogitation or intellect. It is this Cogitable
Universal that is alone real; Sensible Particulars are not real, nor
lasting, nor trustworthy. None but a few philosophers, however, can
attain to such pure mental energy during this life; nor even they fully
and perfectly. But they will attain it fully after death (their souls
being immortal), if their lives have been passed in sober philosophical
training. And their souls enjoyed it before birth during the period of
pre-existence; having acquired, before junction with the body, the
knowledge of these Universals, which are forgotten during childhood, but
 recalled in the way of Reminiscence, by sensible perceptions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555"></a>555</span>that
 make a distant approach to them. Thus, according to the Phædon and some
 other dialogues, all learning is merely reminiscence; the mind is
brought back, by the laws of association, to the knowledge of Universal
Realities that it had possessed in its state of pre-existence.
Particulars of sense participate in these Universals to a certain
extent, or resemble them imperfectly; and they are therefore called by
the same name.</p>
<p>
In the Republic, we have a repetition and copious illustration of this
antithesis between the world of Universals or Cogitables, which are the
only unchangeable realities and the only objects of knowledge, — and the
 world of Sensible Particulars, which are transitory and confused
shadows of these Universals, and are objects of opinion only. Full and
real Ens is knowable, Non-Ens is altogether unknowable; what is midway
between the two is matter of opinion, and in such midway are the
Particulars of sense.<a name="FnAnchor15_7" href="#Footnote15_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
 Respecting these last, no truth is attainable: whenever you affirm a
proposition respecting any of them, you may with equal truth affirm the
contrary at the same time. Nowhere is the contrast between the
Universals or real Ideas (among which the Idea of Good is the highest,
predominant over all the rest), and the unreal Particulars, or Percepta,
 of Sense, more forcibly insisted upon than in the Republic. Even the
celestial bodies and their movements, being among these Percepta of
sense, are ranked among phantoms interesting but useless to observe;
they are the best of all Percepta, but they fall very short of the
perfection that the mental eye contemplates in the Ideal — in the true
Figures and Numbers, in the real Velocity and the real Slowness. In the
simile commencing the seventh book of the Republic, Plato compares
mankind to prisoners in a cave, chained in one particular attitude, so
as to behold only an ever-varying multiplicity of shadows, projected,
through the opening of the cave upon the wall before them, by certain
unseen realities behind. The philosopher is one among a few, who by
training or inspiration, have been enabled to face about from this
original attitude, and to contemplate with his mind the real
unchangeable Universals, instead of having his eye fixed upon their
particular manifestations, at once shadowy and transient. By such mental
 revolution he comes round from the Perceivable to the Cogitable, from
Opinion to Knowledge.</p>

<p>
The distinction between these two is farther argued in the elaborate
dialogue called Theætetus, where Sokrates, trying to explain what
Knowledge or Cognition is, refutes three proposed explanations and
shows, to his own satisfaction, that it is not sensible perception, that
 it is not true opinion, that it is not true opinion coupled with
rational explanation. But he confesses himself unable to show what
Knowledge or Cognition is, though he continues to announce it as
correlating with Realities Cogitable and Universal only.<a name="FnAnchor15_8" href="#Footnote15_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>
In the passages above noticed, and in many others besides, we find Plato
 drawing a capital distinction between Universals eternal and
unchangeable (each of them a Unit as well as a Universal),<a name="FnAnchor15_9" href="#Footnote15_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
 which he affirms to be the only real Entia, — and Particulars transient
 and variable, which are not Entia at all, but are always coming or
going; the Universals being objects of cogitation and of a psychological
 fact called Cognition, which he declares to be infallible; and the
Particulars being objects of Sense, and of another psychological fact
radically different, called Opinion, which he pronounces to be fallible
and misleading. Plato holds, moreover, that the Particulars, though
generically distinct and separate from the Universals, have nevertheless
 a certain communion or participation with them, by virtue of which they
 become half existent and half cognizable, but never attain to full
reality or cognizability.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_9" id="Footnote15_9"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_9">9</a></span>
 Plato, Philêbus, p. 15, A. B.; Republic, x. p. 596, A. The phrase of
Milton, “unus et universus,” expresses this idea; also the lines:— </p>
<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td>
<div class="poem">

<p class="noind">  “Sed quamlibet natura sit communior,<br>
  Tamen seorsus extat ad modum unius,” &amp;c.
</p></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>
This is the first statement of the theory of complete and unqualified
Realism, which came to be known in the Middle Ages under the phrase <i>Universalia ante rem</i> or <i>extra rem</i>, and to be distinguished from the two counter-theories <i>Universalia in re</i> (Aristotelian), and <i>Universalia post rem</i> (Nominalism). Indeed, the Platonic theory goes even farther than the phrase <i>Universalia ante rem</i>,
 which recognizes the particular as a reality, though posterior and
derivative; for Plato attenuates it into phantom and shadow. The problem
 was now clearly set out in philosophy — What are the objects
correlating with Universal terms, and with Particular terms? What is the
 relation between the two? Plato first gave to the world the solution
called Realism, which lasted so long after his time. We shall presently
find Aristotle taking issue with him on both the affirmations included
in his theory.</p>
<p>
But though Plato first introduced this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>556</span>theory
 into philosophy, he was neither blind to the objections against it, nor
 disposed to conceal them. His mind was at once poetically constructive
and dialectically destructive; to both these impulses the theory
furnished ample scope, while the form of his compositions (separate
dialogues, with no mention of his own name) rendered it easy to give
expression either to one or to the other. Before Aristotle arose to take
 issue with him, we shall find him taking issue with himself, especially
 in the dialogues called Sophistes and Parmenides, not to mention the
Philêbus, wherein he breaks down the unity even of his sovereign Idea,
which in the Republic governs the Cogitable World, — the Idea of Good.<a name="FnAnchor15_10" href="#Footnote15_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_10" id="Footnote15_10"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_10">10</a></span> Plato, Philêbus, pp. 65, 66.

<p>
Both in the Sophistes and in the Parmenides, the leading disputant
introduced by Plato is not Sokrates, but Parmenides and another person
(unnamed) of the Eleatic school. In both dialogues objections are taken
against the Realistic theory elsewhere propounded by Plato, though the
objections adduced in the one are quite distinct from those noticed in
the other. In the Sophistes, the Eleatic reasoner impugns successfully
the theories of two classes of philosophers, one the opposite of the
other: first, the Materialists, who recognized no Entia except the
Percepta of Sense; next, the Realistic Idealists, who refused to
recognize these last as real Entia, or as anything more than transient
and mutable Generata or Fientia, while they confined the title of Entia
to the Forms, cogitable, incorporeal, eternal, immutable, neither acting
 on anything, nor acted upon by anything. These persons are called in
the Sophistes “Friends of Forms,” and their theory is exactly what we
have already cited out of so many other dialogues of Plato, drawing the
marked line of separation between Entia and Fientia; between the
Immutable, which alone is real and cognizable, and the Mutable, neither
real nor cognizable. The Eleate in the Sophistes controverts this
Platonic theory, and maintains that among the Universal Entia there are
included items mutable as well as immutable; that both are real and both
 cognizable; that Non-Ens (instead of being set in glaring contrast with
 Ens, as the totally incogitable against the infallibly cognizable)<a name="FnAnchor15_11" href="#Footnote15_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
 is one among the multiplicity of Real Forms, meaning only what is
different from Ens, and therefore cognizable not less than Ens; that
Percepta and Cogitata are alike real, yet both only relatively real,
correlating with minds percipient and cogitant. Thus, the reasoning in
the Sophistes, while it sets aside the doctrine of <i>Universalia ante rem</i>, does not mark out any other relation between Universals and Particulars (neither <i>in re</i> nor <i>post rem</i>).
 It discusses chiefly the intercommunion or reciprocal exclusion of
Universals with respect to each other; and upon this point, far from
representing them as objects of infallible Cognition as contrasted with
Opinion, it enrolls both Opinion and Discourse among the Universals
themselves, and declares both of them to be readily combinable with
Non-Ens and Falsehood. So that we have here error and fallibility
recognized in the region of Universals, as well as in that of
Particulars.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_11" id="Footnote15_11"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_11">11</a></span> Plato, Republic, v. pp. 478, 479.</p></div>
<p>
But it is principally in the dialogue Parmenides that Plato discusses
with dialectical acuteness the relation of Universals to their
Particulars; putting aside the intercommunion (affirmed in the
Sophistes) or reciprocal exclusion between one Universal and another, as
 an hypothesis at least supremely difficult to vindicate, if at all
admissible.<a name="FnAnchor15_12" href="#Footnote15_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
 In the dialogue, Sokrates is introduced in the unusual character of a
youthful and ardent aspirant in philosophy, defending the Platonic
theory of Ideas as we have seen it proclaimed in the Republic and in the
 Timæus. The veteran Parmenides appears as the opponent to cross-examine
 him; and not only impugns the theory by several interrogatories which
Sokrates cannot answer, but also intimates that there remain behind
other objections equally serious requiring answer. Yet at the same time
he declares that, unless the theory be admitted, and unless <i>Universalia ante rem</i>
 can be sustained as existent, there is no trustworthy cognition
attainable, nor any end to be served by philosophical debate. Moreover,
Parmenides warns Sokrates that, before he can acquire a mental condition
 competent to defend the theory, he must go through numerous preliminary
 dialectical exercises; following out both the affirmative and the
negative hypotheses in respect to a great variety of Universals
severally. To illustrate the course prescribed, Parmenides gives a long
specimen of this dialectic in handling his own doctrine of Ens Unum. He
takes first the hypothesis <i>Si Unum est</i>, next the hypothesis <i>Si Unum non est</i>;
 and he deduces from each, by ingenious subtleties, double and
contradictory conclusions. These he sums up at the end, challenging <span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span>Sokrates to solve the puzzles before affirming his thesis.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_12" id="Footnote15_12"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_12">12</a></span> Plato, Parmenid. p. 129, E.; with Stallbaum’s Prolegomena to that dialogue, pp. 38-42.</p></div>
<p>
Apart from these antinomies at the close of the dialogue, the
cross-examination of Sokrates by Parmenides, in the middle of it, brings
 out forcibly against the Realistic theory objections such as those
urged against it by the Nominalists of the Middle Ages. In the first
place, we find that Plato conceived the theory itself differently from
Porphyry and the philosophers that wrote subsequently to the Peripatetic
 criticism. Porphyry and his successors put the question, Whether Genera
 and Species had a separate existence, apart from the Individuals
composing them? Now, the world of Forms (the Cogitable or Ideal world as
 opposed to the Sensible) is not here conceived by Plato as peopled in
the first instance by Genera and Species. Its first tenants are <i>Attributes</i>, and attributes distinctly <i>relative</i>
 — Likeness, One and Many, Justice, Beauty, Goodness, &amp;c. Sokrates,
being asked by Parmenides whether he admits Forms corresponding with
these names, answers unhesitatingly in the affirmative. He is next asked
 whether he admits forms corresponding to the names Man, Fire, Water,
&amp;c., and, instead of replying in the affirmative, intimates that he
does not feel sure. Lastly, the question is put whether there are Forms
corresponding to the names of mean objects — Mud, Hair, Dirt, &amp;c. At
 first he answers emphatically in the negative, and treats the
affirmative as preposterous; there exist no cogitable Hair, &amp;c., but
 only the object of sense that we so denominate. Yet, on second
thoughts, he is not without misgiving that there may be Forms even of
these; though the supposition is so repulsive to him that he shakes it
off as much as he can. Upon this last expression of sentiment Parmenides
 comments, ascribing it to the juvenility of Sokrates, and intimating
that, when Sokrates has become more deeply imbued with philosophy, he
will cease to set aside any of these objects as unworthy.</p>
<p>
Here we see that, in the theory of Realism as conceived by Sokrates, the
 Self-Existent Universals are not Genera and Species as such, but
Attributes — not Second Substances or Essences, but Accidents or
Attributes, <i>e.g.</i> Quality, Quantity, Relation, &amp;c., to use the
 language afterwards introduced in the Aristotelian Categories; that no
Genera or Species are admitted except with hesitation; and that the mean
 and undignified among them are scarcely admissible at all. This
sentiment of dignity, associated with the <i>Universalia ante rem</i>,
and emotional necessity for tracing back particulars to an august and
respected origin, is to be noted as a marked and lasting feature of the
Realistic creed; and it even passed on to the <i>Universalia in re</i>, as afterwards affirmed by Aristotle. Parmenides here takes exception to it (and so does Plato elsewhere<a name="FnAnchor15_13" href="#Footnote15_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>) as inconsistent with faithful adherence to scientific analogy.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_13" id="Footnote15_13"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_13">13</a></span> Plato, Sophist. p. 227, A. Politikus, p. 266, D.</p></div>
<p>
Parmenides then proceeds (interrogating Sokrates) first to state what
the Realistic theory is (Universals apart from Particulars — Particulars
 apart from Universals, yet having some participation in them, and named
 after them), next to bring out the difficulties attaching to it. The
Universal or Form (he argues) cannot be entire in each of its many
separate particulars; nor yet is it divisible, so that a part can be in
one particular, and a part in another. For take the Forms Great, Equal,
Small; Equal magnitudes are equal because they partake in the Form of
Equality. But how can a part of the Form Equality, less than the whole
Form, cause the magnitudes to be equal? How can the Form Smallness have
any parts less than itself, or how can it be greater than anything? </p>
<p>
The Form cannot be divided, nor can it co-exist undivided in each
separate particular; accordingly, particulars can have no participation
in it at all. </p>
<p>
Again, you assume a Form of Greatness, because you see many particular
objects, each of which appears to you great; this being the point of
resemblance between them. But if you compare the Form of Greatness with
any or all of the particular great objects, you will perceive a
resemblance between them; this will require you to assume a higher Form,
 and so on upward without limit.</p>
<p>
Sokrates, thus embarrassed, starts the hypothesis that perhaps each of
these Forms may be a cogitation, and nothing more, existing only within
the mind. How? rejoins Parmenides. Can there be a cogitation of nothing
at all? Must not each cogitation have a real <i>cogitatum</i>
correlating with it, — in this case, the one Form that is identical
throughout many particulars? If you say that particulars partake in the
Form, and that each Form is nothing but a cogitation, does not this
imply that each particular is itself cogitant?</p>
<p>
Again Sokrates urges that the Forms are constant, unalterable,
stationary in nature; that particulars resemble them, and participate in
 them only so far as to resemble them. But (rejoins Parmenides), if
particulars resemble the Form, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>the
 Form must resemble them; accordingly, you must admit another and higher
 Form, as the point of resemblance between the Form and its particulars;
 and so on, upwards.</p>
<p>
And farther (continues Parmenides), even when admitting these Universal
Forms as self-existent, how can we know anything about them? Forms can
correlate only with Forms, Particulars only with Particulars. Thus, if
I, an individual man, am master, I correlate with another individual
man, who is my servant, and he on his side with me. But the Form of
mastership, the Universal self-existent Master, must correlate with the
Form of servantship, the Universal Servant. The correlation does not
subsist between members of the two different worlds, but between
different members of the same world respectively. Thus the Form of
Cognition correlates with the Form of Truth; and the Form of each
variety of Cognition, with the Form of the corresponding variety of
Truth. But we, as individual subjects, do not possess in ourselves the
Form of Cognition; our cognition is our own, correlating with such truth
 as belongs to it and to ourselves. Our cognition cannot reach to the
Form of Truth, nor therefore to any other Form; we can know nothing of
the Self-good, Self-beautiful, Self-just, &amp;c., even supposing such
Forms to exist.</p>
<p>
These acute and subtle arguments are nowhere answered by Plato. They
remain as unsolved difficulties, embarrassing the Realistic theory; they
 are reinforced by farther difficulties no less grave, included in the
dialectical antinomies of Parmenides at the close of the dialogue, and
by an unknown number of others indicated as producible, though not
actually produced. Yet still Plato, with full consciousness of these
difficulties, asserts unequivocally that, unless the Realistic theory
can be sustained, philosophical research is fruitless, and truth cannot
be reached. We see thus that the author of the theory has also left on
record some of the most forcible arguments against it. It appears from
Aristotle (though we do not learn the fact from the Platonic dialogues),
 that Plato, in his later years, symbolized the Ideas or Forms under the
 denomination of Ideal Numbers, generated by implication of The One with
 what he called The Great and Little, or the Indeterminate Dyad. This
last, however, is not the programme wherein the Realistic theory stands
opposed to Nominalism.</p>
<p>
But the dialogue Parmenides, though full of acuteness on the negative
side, not only furnishes no counter-theory, but asserts continued
allegiance to the Realistic theory, which passes as Plato’s doctrine to
his successors. To impugn, forcibly and even unanswerably, a theory at
once so sweeping and so little fortified by positive reasons, was what
many dialecticians of the age could do. But to do this, and at the same
time to construct a counter-theory, was a task requiring higher powers
of mind. One, however, of Plato’s disciples and successors was found
adequate to the task — Aristotle.</p>
<p>
The Realistic Ontology of Plato is founded (as Aristotle himself
remarks) upon mistrust and contempt of perception of sense, as bearing
entirely on the flux of particulars, which never stand still so as to
become objects of knowledge. All reality, and all cognoscibility, were
supposed to reside in the separate world of Cogitable Universals (<i>extra rem</i> or <i>ante rem</i>),
 of which, in some confused manner, particulars were supposed to
partake. The Universal, apart from its particulars, was clearly and
fully knowable, furnishing propositions constantly and infallibly true:
the Universal as manifested in its particulars was never fully knowable,
 nor could ever become the subject of propositions, except such as were
sometimes true and sometimes false.</p>
<p>
Against this separation of the Universal from its Particulars, Aristotle
 entered a strong protest; as well as against the subsidiary hypothesis
of a participation of the latter in the former; which participation,
when the two had been declared separate, appeared to him not only
untenable and uncertified, but unintelligible. His arguments are
interesting, as being among the earliest objections known to us against
Realism.</p>
<p>
1. Realism is a useless multiplication of existences, serving no
purpose. Wherever a number of particulars — be they substances, eternal
or perishable, or be they qualities, or relations — bear the same name,
and thus have a Universal <i>in re</i> predicable of them in common, in every such case Plato assumes a Universal <i>extra rem</i>, or a separate self-existent Form; which explains nothing, and merely doubles the total to be summed up.<a name="FnAnchor15_14" href="#Footnote15_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_14" id="Footnote15_14"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_14">14</a></span> Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ix. p. 990, a. 34; <span class="smcap">M.</span>
 iv. p. 1079, a. 2. Here we have the first appearance of the argument
that William of Ockham, the Nominalist, put in the foreground of his
case against Realism: “Entia non sunt multiplicanda præter
necessitatem.”</p></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>2. Plato's arguments in support of Realism are either inconclusive,
or prove too much. Wherever there is cognition (he argues), there must
exist an eternal and unchangeable object of cognition, apart from
particulars, which are changeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id="page559"></a>559</span> and perishable. No, replies Aristotle: cognition does not require the <i>Universale extra rem</i>; for the <i>Universale in re</i>,
 the constant predicate of all the particulars, is sufficient as an
object of cognition. Moreover, if the argument were admitted, it would
prove that there existed separate Forms or Universals of mere negations;
 for many of the constant predicates are altogether negative. Again, if
Self-existent Universals are to be assumed corresponding to all our
cogitations, we must assume Universals of extinct particulars, and even
of fictitious particulars, such as hippocentaurs or chimeras; for of
these, too, we have phantasms or concepts in our minds.<a name="FnAnchor15_15" href="#Footnote15_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_15" id="Footnote15_15"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_15">15</a></span> Aristot. Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ix. p. 990, b. 14; Scholia, p. 565, b. 9, Br.</p></div>
<p>
3. The most subtle disputants on this matter include Relata, among the
Universal Ideas or Forms. This is absurd, because these do not
constitute any Genus by themselves. These disputants have also urged
against the Realistic theory that powerful and unsolved objection,
entitled “The Third Man.”<a name="FnAnchor15_16" href="#Footnote15_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_16" id="Footnote15_16"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_16">16</a></span> Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ix. p. 990, b. 15: &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;. Both the points here noticed appear in the Parmenides of Plato.</p>
<p>
The objection called “The Third Man” is expressed by saying that, if
there be a Form of man, resembling individual men, you must farther
postulate some higher Form, marking the point of resemblance between the
 two; and so on higher, without end.</p>
<p>
The authenticity of the Platonic Parmenides is disputed by Ueberweg
(Untersuchungen über die Echtheit und Zeitfolge der Platonischen
Schriften, pp. 176-181), upon the ground (among others) that, while
Aristotle never cites the dialogue by its title, nor ever makes probable
 allusion to it, the Parmenides advances against the theory of the
Platonic Ideas this objection of Aristotle’s, known under the name of
“The Third Man.” Aristotle (says Ueberweg), if he had known the
Parmenides, would not have advanced this objection as his own. We must
therefore suppose that the Parmenides was composed later than Aristotle,
 and borrowed this objection from Aristotle. </p>
<p>
In reply to this argument I transcribe the passage of Aristotle (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span>
 ix. p. 990, b. 15) to which Ueberweg himself refers: &#7956;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#959;&#7985;
&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945;&#962;, &#8039;&#957; &#959;&#8020; &#966;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;
&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;. The same
words (with the exception of &#966;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#957; in place of &#966;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;) are repeated in <span class="smcap">M.</span> p. 1079, a. 11.</p>
<p>
Now these words plainly indicate that Aristotle does not profess to
advance the objection, called &#8001; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, as his own, or as
broached by himself. He derives it from what he calls &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;
&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;. The charge against Aristotle, therefore, of advancing as his
own an objection which had already been suggested by Plato himself in
the Parmenides, is unfounded. And it is the more unfounded, because
Aristotle, in the first book of the Metaphysica, speaks in the language
of a Platonist, and considers himself as partly responsible for the
doctrine of Ideas: &#948;&#949;&#943;&#954;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#957;, &#966;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;, &#959;&#7984;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;, &amp;c. (Alexand. in
Schol. p. 563, b. 27, Brand.)</p>
<p>
But what are we to understand by these words — &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;
 — from which Aristotle derives the objection? The words refer to
certain expositions or arguments (oral, or written, or both) which were
within the knowledge of Aristotle, and were of a peculiarly subtle and
analytical character. Among them is very probably included the Platonic
Parmenides itself, distinguished as it is for extreme subtlety. (See
Stallbaum’s Prolegg. pp. 249, 277, 337, who says, “In uno ferè Parmenide
 idearum doctrina subtilius investigatur.”) I see no reason why it
should not be included within the fair and reasonable meaning of the
words. And such being the case, I cannot go along with Ueberweg (and
other critics) who say that Aristotle has not even made an indirect
allusion to the Parmenides.</p>
<p>
But why did not Aristotle specify the Parmenides directly and by name? I
 do not know what was his reason. We may feel surprise (as Stallbaum
feels, p. 337) that he does not; but, when critics infer from the
omission that he did not know the dialogue as a work of Plato, I contest
 the inference. We see that Alexander, in his elaborate commentary (p.
566, Schol. Brand.) makes no allusion to the Parmenides, though he
alludes to Eudêmus, to Diodôrus, Kronus, and to the manner in which the
objection called &#8001; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; was handled by various Sophists. Now
we are fully assured that the Parmenides was acknowledged as a work of
Plato, long before the time of Alexander (since it is included in the
catalogue of Thrasyllus); yet he, the most instructed of all the
commentators, makes no allusion to it. Why he did not, I cannot say, but
 his omission affords no ground for concluding that he did not know it,
or did not trust its authenticity.</p></div>
<p>
4. The supporters of these Self-existent Universals trace them to two <i>principia</i>
 — The One, and the Indeterminate Dyad; which they affirm to be prior in
 existence even to the Universals themselves. But this cannot be
granted; for the Idea of Number must be logically prior to the Idea of
the Dyad; but the Idea of Number is relative, and the Relative can never
 be prior to the Absolute or Self-existent.</p>
<p>
5. If we grant that, wherever there is one constant predicate belonging
to many particulars, or wherever there is stable and trustworthy
cognition, in all such cases a Self-existent Universal Correlate <i>extra rem</i>
 is to be assumed, we shall find that this applies not merely to
Substances or Essences, but also to the other Categories — Quality,
Quantity, Relation, &amp;c. But hereby we exclude the possibility of
participation in them by Particulars; since from such participation the
Particular derives its Substance or Essence alone, not its accidental
predicates. Thus the Self-existent Universal Dyad is eternal: but a
particular pair, which derives its essential property of doubleness from
 partaking in this Universal Dyad, does not at the same time partake of
eternity, unless by accident. Accordingly, there are no Universal Ideas,
 except of Substances or Essences: the common name, when applied to the
world of sense and to that of cogitation, signifies the same thing —
Substance or Essence. It is unmeaning to talk of anything else as
signified — any other predicate common to many. Well then, if the Form
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id="page560"></a>560</span>Universals
 and the Form of those Particulars that participate in the Universals be
 the same, we shall have something common to both the one and the other,
 so that the objection called “The Third Man” will become applicable,
and a higher Form must be postulated. But, if the Form of the Universals
 and the Form of the participating Particulars, be not identical, then
the same name, as signifying both, will be used equivocally; just as if
you applied the same denomination man to Kallias and to a piece of wood,
 without any common property to warrant it.</p>
<p>
6. But the greatest difficulty of all is to understand how these
Cogitable Universals, not being causes of any change or movement,
contribute in any way to the objects of sense, either to the eternal or
to the perishable; or how they assist us towards the knowledge thereof,
being not in them, and therefore not their substance or essence; or how
they stand in any real relation to their participants, being not
immanent therein. Particulars certainly do not proceed from these
Universals, in any intelligible sense. To say that the Universals are
archetypes, and that Particulars partake in them, is unmeaning, and mere
 poetic metaphor. For where is the working force to mould them in
conformity with the Universals? Any one thing may <i>be</i> like, or may <i>become</i>
 like, to any other particular thing, by accident, or without any
regular antecedent cause to produce such assimilation. The same
particular substance, moreover, will have not one universal archetype
only, but several. Thus, the same individual man will have not only the
Self-animal and the Self-biped, but also the Self-man, as archetype.
Then again, there will be universal archetypes, not merely for
particular sensible objects, but also for Universals themselves; thus
the genus will be an archetype for its various species; so that the same
 which is now archetype will, under other circumstances, be copy.</p>
<p>
7. Furthermore, it seems impossible that what is Substance or Essence
can be separate from that whereof it is the substance or essence. How
then can the Universals, if they be the essences of sensible things,
have any existence apart from those sensible things? Plato tells us in
the Phædon, that the Forms or Universals are the causes why particulars
both exist at all, and come into such or such modes of existence. But
even if we assume Universals as existing, still the Particulars
participant therein will not come into being, unless there be some
efficient cause to produce movement; moreover, many other things come
into being, though there be no Universals correlating therewith, <i>e.g.</i>
 a house, or a ring. The same causes that were sufficient to bring these
 last into being, will be sufficient to bring all particulars into
being, without assuming any Universals <i>extra rem</i> at all.</p>
<p>
8. Again, if the Universals or Forms are Numbers, how can they ever be
causes? Even if we suppose Particulars to be Numbers also, how can one
set of Numbers be causes to the others? There can be no such causal
influence, even if one set be eternal, and the other perishable.<a name="FnAnchor15_17" href="#Footnote15_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a></p>

 p. 991, b. 13. Several other objections are made by Aristotle against
that variety of the Platonic theory wherein the Ideas were commuted into
 Ideal Numbers. These objections do not belong to the controversy of
Realism against Nominalism.</p></div>
<p>
Out of the many objections raised by Aristotle against Plato, we have
selected such as bear principally upon the theory of Realism; that is,
upon the theory of <i>Universalia ante rem</i> or <i>extra rem</i> —
self-existent, archetypal, cogitable substances, in which Particulars
faintly participate. The objections are not superior in acuteness, and
they are decidedly inferior, in clearness of enunciation, to those that
Plato himself produces in the Parmenides. Moreover, several of them are
founded upon Aristotle’s point of view, and would have failed to
convince Plato. The great merit of Aristotle is, that he went beyond the
 negative of the Parmenides, asserted this new point of view of his own,
 and formulated it into a counter-theory. He rejected altogether the
separate and exclusive reality which Plato had claimed for his Absolutes
 of the cogitable world, as well as the derivative and unreal semblance
that alone Plato accorded to the sensible world. Without denying the
distinction of the two, as conceivable and nameable, he maintained that
truth and cognition required that they should be looked at in
implication with each other. And he went even a step farther, in
antithesis to Plato, by reversing the order of the two. Instead of
considering the Cogitable Universals alone as real and complete in
themselves, and the Sensible Particulars as degenerate and confused
semblances of them, he placed complete reality in the Sensible
Particulars alone,<a name="FnAnchor15_18" href="#Footnote15_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span>and
 treated the Cogitable Universals as contributory appendages thereto;
some being essential, others non-essential, but all of them relative,
and none of them independent integers. His philosophy was a complete
revolution as compared with Parmenides and Plato; a revolution, too, the
 more calculated to last, because he embodied it in an elaborate and
original theory of Logic, Metaphysics, and Ontology. He was the first
philosopher that, besides recognizing the equivocal character of those
general terms whereon speculative debate chiefly turns, endeavoured
methodically to set out and compare the different meanings of each term,
 and their relations to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_18" id="Footnote15_18"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_18">18</a></span>
 Aristotle takes pains to vindicate against both Plato and the
Herakleiteans the dignity of the Sensible World. They that depreciate
sensible objects as perpetually changing, unstable, and unknowable, make
 the mistake (he observes) of confining their attention to the sublunary
 interior of the Kosmos, where, indeed, generation and destruction
largely prevail. But this is only a small portion of the entire Kosmos.
In the largest portion — the visible, celestial, superlunary regions —
there is no generation or destruction at all, nothing but permanence and
 uniformity. In appreciating the sensible world (Aristotle says)
philosophers ought to pardon the shortcomings of the smaller portion on
account of the excellences of the larger; and not condemn both together
on account of the smaller (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> v. p. 1010, a. 30).</p></div>
<p>
However much the Ontology of Aristotle may fail to satisfy modern
exigencies, still, as compared with the Platonic Realism, it was a
considerable improvement. Instead of adopting Ens as a self-explaining
term, contrasted with the Generated and Perishable (the doctrine of
Plato in the Republic, Phædon, and Timæus), he discriminates several
distinct meanings of Ens; a discrimination not always usefully pursued,
but tending in the main towards a better theory. The distinction between
 Ens potential, and Ens actual, does not belong directly to the question
 between Realism and Nominalism, yet it is a portion of that
philosophical revolution wrought by Aristotle against Plato —
displacement of the seat of reality, and transfer of it from the
Cogitable Universal to the Sensible Particular. The direct enunciation
of this change is contained in his distinction of Ens into Fundamental
and Concomitant (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;), and his still greater refinement on the
same principle by enumerating the ten varieties of Ens called Categories
 or Predicaments.<a name="FnAnchor15_19" href="#Footnote15_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 He will not allow Ens (nor Unum) to be a genus, partible into species:
he recognizes it only as a word of many analogous meanings, one of them
principal and fundamental, the rest derivative and subordinate thereto,
each in its own manner. Aristotle thus establishes a graduated scale of
Entia, each having its own value and position, and its own mode of
connexion with the common centre. That common centre Aristotle declared
to be of necessity some individual object — Hoc Aliquid, That Man, This
Horse, &amp;c. This was the common subject, to which all the other Entia
 belonged as predicates, and without which none of them had any reality.
 We here fall into the language of Logic, the first theory of which we
owe to Aristotle. His ontological classification was adapted to that
theory.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_19" id="Footnote15_19"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_19">19</a></span> In enumerating the Ten Categories, Aristotle takes his departure from the Proposition — <i>Homo currit</i> — <i>Homo vincit</i>.
 He assumes a particular individual as subject; and he distributes,
under ten general heads, all the information that can be asked or given
about that subject — all the predicates that can be affirmed or denied
thereof. [See <a href="#ch3">Ch. iii.</a>, especially <a href="#page73">p. 73</a>, seq.]</p></div>
<p>
As we are here concerned only with the different ways of conceiving the
relation between the Particular and the Universal, we are not called on
to criticize the well-known decuple enumeration of Categories or
Predicaments given by Aristotle, both in his treatise called by that
name and elsewhere. For our purpose it is enough to point out that the
particular sensible Hoc Aliquid is declared to be the ultimate subject,
to which all Universals attach, as determinants or accompaniments; and
that, if this condition be wanting, the unattached Universal cannot rank
 among complete Entia. The subject or First Substance, which can never
become a predicate, is established as the indispensable ultimate subject
 for all predicates; if that disappears, all predicates disappear along
with it. The Particular thus becomes the keystone of the arch whereon
all Universals rest. Aristotle is indeed careful to point out a
gradation in these predicates: some are essential to the subject, and
thus approach so near to the First Substance that he calls them Second
Substances; others, and the most in number, are not thus essential;
these last are Concomitants or Accidents, and some of them fall so much
short of complete Entity that he describes them as near to Non-Entia.<a name="FnAnchor15_20" href="#Footnote15_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
 But all of them, essential or unessential, are alike constituents or
appendages of the First Substance or Particular Subject, and have no
reality in any other character.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_20" id="Footnote15_20"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_20">20</a></span> Aristot. Metaph. <span class="smcap">E.</span> p. 1026, b. 21: &#966;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#964;&#972; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#947;&#973;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;.</p>
<p>
There cannot be a stronger illustration of the difference between the
Platonic and the Aristotelian point of view, than the fact that Plato
applies the same designation to all particular objects of sense — that
they are only midway between Entia and Non-Entia (Republic, v. pp.
478-479).</p></div>
<p>
We thus have the counter-theory of Aristotle against the Platonic
Realism. Instead of separate Universal Substances, containing in
themselves full reality, and forfeiting much of that reality when they
faded down into the shadowy copies called Particulars, he inverts the
Platonic order, announces full reality to be the privilege of the
Particular Sensible, and confines the function of the Universal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id="page562"></a>562</span>to
 that of a predicate, in or along with the Particular. There is no
doctrine that he protests against more frequently than the ascribing of
separate reality to the Universal. The tendency to do this, he
signalizes as a natural but unfortunate illusion, lessening the
beneficial efficacy of universal demonstrative reasoning.<a name="FnAnchor15_21" href="#Footnote15_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 And he declares it to be a corollary from this view of the Particular
as indispensable subject along with the Universal as its predicate —
That the first principles of Demonstration in all the separate
theoretical sciences must be obtained by Induction from particulars:
first by impressions of sense preserved in the memory; then by
multiplied remembrances enlarged into one experience; lastly, by many
experiences generalized into one principle by the Noûs.<a name="FnAnchor15_22" href="#Footnote15_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>
<p>

<p>
A similar doctrine is stated by Plato in the Phædon (p. 96, B) as one
among the intellectual phases that Sokrates had passed through in the
course of his life, without continuing in them.</p></div>
<p>
While Aristotle thus declares Induction to be the source from whence
Demonstration in these separate sciences draws its first principles, we
must at the same time acknowledge that his manner of treating Science is
 not always conformable to this declaration, and that he often seems to
forget Induction altogether. This is the case not only in his First
Philosophy, or Metaphysics, but also in his Physics. He there professes
to trace out what he calls beginnings, causes, elements, &amp;c., and he
 analyses most of the highest generalities. Yet still these analytical
enquiries (whatever be their value) are usually, if not always, kept in
subordination to the counter-theory that he had set up against the
Platonic Realism. Complete reality resides (he constantly repeats) only
in the particular sensible substances and sensible facts or movements
that compose the aggregate Kosmos: which is not generated, but eternal,
both as to substance and as to movement. If these sensible substances
disappear, nothing remains. The beginnings and causes exist only
relatively to these particulars. Form, Matter, Privation, are not real
Beings, antecedent to the Kosmos, and pre-existent generators of the
substances constituting the Kosmos; they are logical fragments or
factors, obtained by mental analysis and comparison, assisting to
methodize our philosophical point of view or conception of those
substances, but incapable of being understood, and having no value of
their own, apart from the substances. Some such logical analysis (that
of Aristotle or some other) is an indispensable condition even of the
most strictly inductive philosophy.</p>
<p>
There are some portions of the writings of Aristotle (especially the
third book De Animâ and the twelfth book of the Metaphysica) where he
appears to lose sight of the limit here indicated; but, with few
exceptions, we find him constantly remembering, and often repeating, the
 great truth formulated in his Categories: that full or substantive
reality resides only in the Hoc Aliquid, with its predicates implicated
with it, and that even the highest of these predicates (Second
Substances) have no reality apart from some one of their particulars. We
 must recollect that, though Aristotle denies to the predicates a <i>separate</i> reality, he recognizes in them an <i>adjective</i> reality, as accompaniments and determinants: he contemplates all the ten Categories as distinct varieties of existence.<a name="FnAnchor15_23" href="#Footnote15_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 This is sufficient as a basis for abstraction, whereby we can name them
 and reason upon them as distinct objects of thought or points of view,
although none of them come into reality except as implicated with a
sensible particular. Of such reasoning Aristotle’s First Philosophy
chiefly consists; and he introduces peculiar phrases to describe this
distinction of reason between two different points of view, where the
real object spoken of is one and the same. The frequency of the
occasions taken to point out that distinction marks his anxiety to keep
the First Philosophy in harmony with the theory of Reality announced in
his Categories.</p>

<p>
The Categories of Aristotle appear to have become more widely known than
 any other part of his philosophy. They were much discussed by the sects
 coming after him; and, even when not adopted, were present to
speculative minds as a scheme to be amended.<a name="FnAnchor15_24" href="#Footnote15_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
 Most of the arguments turned upon the nine later Categories: it was
debated whether these were properly enumerated and discriminated, and
whether the enumeration as a whole was exhaustive.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_24" id="Footnote15_24"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_24">24</a></span> This is the just remark of Trendelenburg, Kategorienlehre, p. 217.</p></div>
<p>
With these details, however, the question between Realism and its
counter-theory (whether Conceptualism or Nominalism) is not materially
concerned. The standard against Realism was raised by Aristotle in the
First Category, when he proclaimed the Hoc Aliquid to be the only
complete Ens, and the Universal to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id="page563"></a>563</span>exist
 only along with it as a predicate, being nothing in itself apart; and
when he enumerated Quality as one among the predicates, and nothing
beyond. In the Platonic Realism (Phædon, Timæus, Parmenides) what
Aristotle called Quality was the highest and most incontestable among
all Substances — the Good, the Beautiful, the Just, &amp;c.; what
Aristotle called Second Substance was also Substance in the Platonic
Realism, though not so incontestably; but what Aristotle called First
Substance was in the Platonic Realism no Substance at all, but only one
among a multitude of confused and transient shadows. It is in the First
and Third Categories that the capital antithesis of Aristotle against
the Platonic Realism is contained. As far as that antithesis is
concerned, it matters little whether the aggregate of predicates be
subdivided under nine general heads (Categories) or under three.</p>
<p>
In the century succeeding Aristotle, the Stoic philosophers altered his
Categories, and drew up a new list of their own, containing only four
distinct heads instead of ten. We have no record or explanation of the
Stoic Categories from any of their authors; so that we are compelled to
accept the list on secondary authority, from the comments of critics,
mostly opponents. But, as far as we can make out, they retained in their
 First Category the capital feature of Aristotle’s First Category — the
primacy of the First Substance or Hoc Aliquid and its exclusive
privilege of imparting reality to all the other Categories. Indeed, the
Stoics seem not only to have retained this characteristic, but to have
exaggerated it. They did not recognize so close an approach of the
Universal to the Particular, as is implied by giving to it a second
place in the same Category, and calling it Second Substance. The First
Category of the Stoics (Something or Subject) included only particular
substances; all Universals were by them ranked in the other Categories,
being regarded as negations of substances, and designated by the term
Non-Somethings — Non-Substances.<a name="FnAnchor15_25" href="#Footnote15_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote15_25" id="Footnote15_25"></a><a href="#FnAnchor15_25">25</a></span> Prantl, Gesch. der Logik, I. vi. p. 420: <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8020;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;</span> &#964;&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#960;&#945;&#961;’ &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;. &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
The Neo-Platonist Plotinus, in the third century after the Christian
era, agreed with the Stoics (though looking from the opposite point of
view) in disapproving Aristotle’s arrangement of Second Substance in the
 same Category with First Substance.<a name="FnAnchor15_26" href="#Footnote15_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a>
 He criticizes at some length both the Aristotelian list of Categories,
and the Stoic list; but he falls back into the Platonic and even the
Parmenidean point of view. His capital distinction is between Cogitables
 and Sensibles. The Cogitables are in his view the most real (<i>i.e.</i>
 the Aristotelian Second Substance is more real than the First); among
them the highest, Unum or Bonum, is the grand fountain and sovereign of
all the rest. Plotinus thus departed altogether from the Aristotelian
Categories, and revived the Platonic or Parmenidean Realism; yet not
without some Aristotelian modifications. But it is remarkable that in
this departure his devoted friend and scholar Porphyry did not follow
him. Porphyry not only composed an Introduction to the Categories of
Aristotle, but also vindicated them at great length, in a separate
commentary, against the censures of Plotinus; Dexippus, Jamblichus, and
Simplikius, followed in the same track.<a name="FnAnchor15_27" href="#Footnote15_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
 Still, though Porphyry stood forward both as admirer and champion of
the Aristotelian Categories, he did not consider that the question
raised by the First Category of Aristotle against the Platonic Realism
was finally decided. This is sufficiently proved by the three problems
cited above out of the Introduction of Porphyry; where he proclaims it
to be a deep and difficult enquiry, whether Genera and Species had not a
 real substantive existence apart from the individuals composing them.
Aristotle, both in the Categories and in many other places, had declared
 his opinion distinctly in the negative against Plato; but Porphyry had
not made up his mind between the two, though he insists, in language
very Aristotelian, on the distinction between First and Second

<p>
Through the translations and manuals of Boëthius and others, the
Categories of Aristotle were transmitted to the Latin Churchmen, and
continued to be read even through the darkest ages, when the Analytica
and the Topica were unknown or neglected. The Aristotelian
discrimination between First and Second Substance was thus always kept
in sight, and Boëthius treated it much in the same manner as Porphyry
had done before him.<a name="FnAnchor15_29" href="#Footnote15_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> Alcuin, Rhabanus Maurus, and Eric of Auxerre,<a name="FnAnchor15_30" href="#Footnote15_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> in the eighth and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id="page564"></a>564</span>ninth centuries, repeated what they found in Boëthius, and upheld the Aristotelian tradition unimpaired. But Scotus Erigena (<i>d.</i> 880 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>)
 took an entirely opposite view, and reverted to the Platonic
traditions, though with a large admixture of Aristotelian ideas. He was a
 Christian Platonist, blending the transcendentalism of Plato and
Plotinus with theological dogmatic influences (derived from the
Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita and others) and verging somewhat even
towards Pantheism. Scotus Erigena revived the doctrine of Cogitable <i>Universalia extra rem</i> and <i>ante rem</i>.
 He declared express opposition to the arrangement of the First
Aristotelian Category, whereby the individual was put first, in the
character of subject; the Universal second, in the character only of
predicate; complete reality belonging to the two in conjunction. Scotus
maintained that the Cogitable or Incorporeal Universal was the first,
the true and complete real; from whence the sensible individuals were
secondary, incomplete, multiple, derivatives.<a name="FnAnchor15_31" href="#Footnote15_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> But, though he thus adopts and enforces the Platonic theory of Universals <i>ante rem</i> and <i>extra rem</i>, he does not think himself obliged to deny that Universals may be <i>in re</i> also.</p>

<p>
The contradiction of the Aristotelian traditions, so far as concerns the
 First Category, thus proclaimed by Scotus Erigena, appears to have
provoked considerable opposition among his immediate successors.
Nevertheless he also obtained partizans. Remigius of Auxerre and others
not only defended the Platonic Realism, but carried it as far as Plato
himself had done; affirming that not merely Universal Substances, but
also Universal Accidents, had a real separate existence, apart from and
anterior to individuals.<a name="FnAnchor15_32" href="#Footnote15_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
 The controversy for and against the Platonic Realism was thus
distinctly launched in the schools of the Middle Ages. It was upheld
both as a philosophical revival, and as theologically orthodox, entitled
 to supersede the traditional counter-theory of Aristotle.</p>

A. — <i>Sir William Hamilton on Aristotle’s Doctrine.</i></h2>
<p>
In reading attentively Hamilton’s “Dissertation on the Philosophy of
Common Sense” (Note A, annexed to ed. of Reid’s Works, p. 742, seq.), I
find it difficult to seize accurately what he means by the term. It
seems to me that he unsays in one passage what he says in another; and
that what he tells us (p. 750, b.), viz. that “philosophers have rarely
scrupled, on the one hand, quietly to supersede the data of
consciousness, so often as these did not fall in with their pre-adopted
opinions; and on the other clamorously to appeal to them as irrecusable
truths, so often as they could allege them in corroboration of their
own, or in refutation of a hostile, doctrine” — is illustrated by his
own practice.</p>
<p>
On page 752, a., he compares Common Sense to Common Law, and regards it
as consisting in certain elementary feelings and beliefs, which, though
in possession of all, can only be elicited and declared by philosophers,
 who declare it very differently. This comparison, however, sets aside
unassisted Common Sense as an available authority. To make it so we must
 couple with it the same supplement that Common Law requires; that is,
we must agree on some one philosopher as authoritative exponent of
Common Sense. The Common Law of one country is different from that of
another. Even in the same country, it is differently construed and set
forth by different witnesses, advocates, and judges. In each country, a
supreme tribunal is appointed to decide between these versions and to
declare the law. The analogy goes farther than Hamilton wishes. </p>
<p>
On the same page, he remarks:— “In saying (to use the words of Aristotle) simply and without qualification, that this or that <i>is a known truth</i>,
 we do not mean that it is in fact recognized by all, but only by such
as are of a sound understanding; just as, in saying absolutely that a
thing is wholesome, we must be held to mean, to such as are of a hale
constitution.” The passage of Aristotle’s Topica here noticed will be
found to have a different bearing from that which Hamilton gives it.</p>
<p>
Aristotle is laying down (Topica, VI. iv. p. 141, a. 23-p. 142, a. 16)
the various lines of argument which may be followed out, when you are
testing in dialectical debate a definition given or admitted by the
opponent. There cannot be more than one definition of the same thing:
the definition ought to declare the essence of the thing, which can only
 be done by means of <i>priora</i> and <i>notiora</i>. But <i>notiora</i> admits of two meanings: (1) <i>notiora simpliciter</i>; (2) <i>notiora nobis</i> or <i>singulis hominibus</i>. Under the first head, that which is <i>prius</i> is absolutely more knowable than that which is <i>posterius</i>;
 thus, a point more than a line, a line more than a plane, a plane more
than a solid. But under the second head this order is often reversed: to
 most men the solid (as falling more under sense) is more knowable than
the plane, the plane than the line, the line than the point. The first (<i>notiora simpliciter</i>)
 is the truly scientific order, suited to superior and accurate minds,
employed in teaching, learning, and demonstration (p. 141, a. 29:
&#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#940;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;, —
 b. 16: &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#972;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;). The second (<i>notiora nobis</i>)
 is adapted to ordinary minds, who cannot endure regular teaching, nor
understand a definition founded on the first order. But definitions
founded on the second alone (Aristotle says) are not satisfactory, nor
do they reveal the true essence of the thing defined: there can be no
satisfactory definition unless what is <i>notius simpliciter</i> coincides with what is <i>notius nobis</i> (p. 141, b. 24). He then proceeds to explain what is meant by <i>notius simpliciter</i>; and this is the passage quoted by Hamilton. After having said that the <i>notiora nobis</i>
 are not fixed and uniform, but vary with different individuals, and
even in the same individual at different times, he goes on: “It is plain
 therefore that we ought not to define by such characteristics as these
(the <i>notiora nobis</i>), but by the <i>notiora simpliciter</i>: for it is only in this way that we can obtain a definition one and the same at all times. Perhaps, too, the <i>notius simpliciter</i> is not that which is knowable to all, but that which is knowable to those who are well trained <span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span>in
 their intelligence; just as the absolutely wholesome is that which is
wholesome to those who are well constituted in their bodies” (&#7988;&#963;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#8050;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#947;&#957;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953; &#947;&#957;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#949;&#8022;
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#8017;&#947;&#953;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#949;&#8022;
&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; — p. 142, a. 9). </p>
<p>
Hamilton’s translation misses the point of Aristotle, who here repeats
what he frequently also declares in other parts of his writings (see
Analyt. Post. I. i. p. 71, b. 33), namely, the contrast and antithesis
between <i>notius simpliciter</i> (or <i>naturâ</i>) and <i>notius nobis</i>.
 This is a technical distinction of his own, which he had explained very
 fully in the page preceding the words translated by Hamilton; and the
words are intended as a supplementary caution, to guard against a
possible misunderstanding of the phrase. Hamilton’s words — “saying
simply, and without qualification, that this or that is a known truth,”
do not convey Aristotle’s meaning at all; again, the words — “such as
are of a sound understanding,” fail equally in rendering what Aristotle
means by &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#949;&#8022; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#957;. Aristotle tells us
distinctly (in the preceding part of the paragraph) that he intends to
contrast the few minds scientific or prepared for scientific discipline,
 with the many minds unscientific or unprepared for such discipline: he
does not intend to contrast “men of sound understanding” with men “not
of sound understanding.”</p>
<p>
It appears to me that Hamilton has here taken a passage away from its
genuine sense in the Aristotelian context, and has pressed it into his
service to illustrate a view of his own, foreign to that of Aristotle.
He has done the like with some other passages, to which I will now
advert.</p>
<p>
What he says, pp. 764-766, about Aristotle’s use of the term &#7936;&#958;&#943;&#969;&#956;&#945; is
quite opposed to the words of Aristotle himself, who plainly certifies
it as being already in his time a technical term with mathematicians
(Met. <span class="smcap">&#915;.</span> p. 1005, a. 20). On p. 766, a.,
Hamilton says that the word &#7936;&#958;&#943;&#969;&#956;&#945; is not used in any work extant prior
to Aristotle in a logical sense. This is true as to any <i>work</i>
remaining to us, but Aristotle himself talks of previous philosophers or
 reasoners who had so used it; thus he speaks of &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#918;&#942;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#958;&#943;&#969;&#956;&#945;
(Metaph. <span class="smcap">B.</span> p. 1001, b. 7) — “according to
the assumption laid down by Zeno as authoritative.” Of this passage
Hamilton takes no notice: he only refers to the Topica, intimating a
doubt (in my judgment groundless and certainly professed by few modern
critics, if any) whether the Topica is a genuine work of Aristotle. In
the time of Aristotle, various mathematical teachers laid down Axioms,
such as, If equals be taken from equals, the remainders will be equal;
In all propositions, either the affirmative or the negative must be
true, &amp;c. But the case of Zeno shows us that other philosophers also
 laid down Axioms of their own, which were not universally accepted by
others. What Hamilton here says, about Axioms, has little pertinence as a
 contribution to the Philosophy of Common Sense.</p>
<p>
Again, Hamilton says, p. 770, a.: “The native contributions by the mind
itself to our concrete cognitions have, prior to their elicitation into
consciousness through experience, only a <i>potential</i>, and in actual experience only an <i>applied</i>, <i>engaged</i>, or <i>implicate</i>, existence.”</p>
<p>
These words narrow the line of distinction between the two opposite
schools so much, that I cannot see where it is drawn. Every germ has in
it the <i>potentialities</i> of that which it will afterwards become. No one disputes that a baby just born has mental <i>potentialities</i> not possessed by a puppy, a calf, or an acorn. What is the difference between cognitions <i>elicited through experience</i>, and cognitions <i>derived from experience</i>?
 To those who hold the doctrine of Relativity, both our impressions of
sense and our mental activities (such as memory, discrimination,
comparison, abstraction, &amp;c.) are alike indispensable to experience.
 The difference, so far as I can see, between Hamilton and the Inductive
 School, is not so much about the process whereby cognitions are
acquired, as about the mode of testing and measuring the authority of
those cognitions when acquired. Hamilton will not deny that many of the
cognitions which he describes as elicited by experience are untrue or
exaggerated. How are we to discriminate these from the true? The
Inductive School would reply: “By the test of experience, and by that
alone: if these cognitions, which have been elicited in your mind
through experience, are refuted or not confirmed when tested by
subsequent experience carefully watched and selected for the purpose,
they are not true or trustworthy cognitions.” But Hamilton would not
concur in this answer: he would say that the cognitions, though elicited
 <i>through</i> experience, did not derive their authority or trustworthiness <i>from</i>
 experience, but were binding and authoritative in themselves, whether
confirmed by experience or not. In speaking about Axioms, p. 764, b., he
 says: “Aristotle limited” (this is not correct: Aristotle did not <i>limit</i> as here affirmed) “the expression Axiom to those <span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id="page567"></a>567</span>judgments
 which, on occasion of experience, arise naturally and necessarily in
the conscious mind, and which are therefore virtually prior to
experience.” That they are not prior to experience in <i>order of time</i>, is admitted in the words just cited from Hamilton himself: he means, therefore, prior in <i>logical authority</i> — carrying with them the quality of <i>necessity</i>,
 even though experience may afford no confirmation of them. This is what
 he says, on pp. 753-754, about causality: metaphysical causality <i>must</i> be believed, as a necessary and subjective law of the observer — though there is no warrant for it in experience.</p>
<p>
The question between Hamilton and the Inductive School, I repeat, is not
 so much about the psychological genesis of beliefs, as about the test
for distinguishing true from false or uncertified beliefs, among those
beliefs which arise, often and usually, in the minds of most men. Is
there any valid test other than experience itself, as intentionally
varied by experiments and interpreted by careful Induction? Are we ever
warranted in affirming what transcends experience, except to the extent
to which the inference from Induction (from some to all) always
transcends actual observation? This seems to me the real question at
issue between the contending schools of Metaphysics. Hamilton, while he
rejects experience as the test, furnishes no other test whereby we can
discriminate the erroneous beliefs “which are elicited into
consciousness through experience,” from the true beliefs which are
elicited in like manner.</p>
<p>
In discussing the doctrine which Hamilton and other philosophers entitle
 Common Sense (in the metaphysical import which they assign to it), it
is proper to say a few words on the legitimate meaning of this phrase,
before it was pressed into service by a particular school of
metaphysicians. Every one who lives through childhood and boyhood up to
man’s estate will unavoidably acquire a certain amount of knowledge and
certain habits of believing, feeling, judging, &amp;c.; differing
materially in different ages and countries, and varying to a less degree
 in different individuals of the same age and country, yet still
including more or less which is common to the large majority. That fire
burns; that water quenches thirst and drowns; that the sun gives light
and heat; that animals are all mortal and cannot live long without
nourishment, — these and many other beliefs are not possessed by a very
young child, but are acquired by every man as he grows up, though he
cannot remember how or when he learnt them. The sum total of the beliefs
 thus acquired, by the impressions and influences under which every
growing mind might pass, constitutes the Common Sense of a particular
age and country. A person wanting in any of them would be considered, by
 the majority of the inhabitants, as deficient in Common Sense. If I
meet an adult stranger, I presume as a matter of course that he has
acquired them, and I talk to him accordingly. I also presume (being in
England) that he has learnt the language of the country; and that he is
familiar with the forms of English speech whereby such beliefs and their
 correlative disbeliefs are enunciated. If I affirm to him any one of
these beliefs, he assents to it at once: it appears to him self-evident —
 that is, requiring no farther or extraneous evidence to support it.
Though it appears to him self-evident, however, the proposition may
possibly be false. To a Greek of the Aristotelian age, no proposition
could appear more self-evident than that of the earth being at rest. No
term can be more thoroughly relative than the term <i>self-evident</i>: that which appears so to one man, will often not appear so to another, and may sometimes appear altogether untrue. </p>
<p>
But, if we suppose an individual to whom one of these beliefs does not
appear self-evident, and who requires proof, he will not be satisfied to
 be told that every one else believes it, and that it is a dictate of
Common Sense. He probably knows that already, and yet, nevertheless, he
is not convinced. Aristarchus of Samos was told doubtless, often enough,
 that the doctrine of the earth being at rest was the plain verdict of
Common Sense; but he did not the less controvert it. You must produce
the independent proof which the recusant demands; and, if your doctrine
is true and trustworthy, such proof can be produced. I will here remark
that, in so far as Common Sense can properly be quoted as an authority
or presumptive authority, it is such only in the sense proclaimed by
Herakleitus and La Mennais, as cited by Hamilton, pp. 770-771: “as a
magazine of ready-fabricated dogmas.” Hamilton finds fault with both of
them; but it appears to me that they rightly interpret, and that he
wrongly interprets, what Common Sense, as generally understood, is; and
moreover, that most of the other authorities whom he himself quotes
understand the phrase as these two understand it. Common Sense is “a
magazine of ready-fabricated dogmas,” as La Mennais (see p. 771, a.)
considers it — dogmas assumed as self-evident, and as requiring no
proof. It only becomes “a source of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>elementary
 truths” when analysed and remodelled by philosophers. Now philosophers
differ much in their mode of analysing it (as Hamilton himself declares
emphatically), and bring out of it different elementary truths; each of
them professing to follow Common Sense and quoting Common Sense as
warranty. It is plain that Common Sense is no authority for either one
of two discrepant modes of analysis. Its authority counts for those
dogmas out of which the analysis is made, in so far as Common Sense is
authoritative at all.</p>
<p>
Hamilton cites or indicates thirteen different Aristotelian passages, in
 order to support his view that Aristotle is to be numbered among the
champions of authoritative Common Sense. It will be seen that most of
the passages prove nothing, and that only one proves much, in favour of
that view. I shall touch upon them <i>seriatim</i>.</p>
<p>
(<i>a</i>) “First truths are such as are believed, not through aught else” (say rather <i>through other truths</i>) “but through themselves alone. For, in regard to the first principles of science, we ought not to require the reason <i>Why</i>; for each such principle behoves to be itself a <i>belief</i> in and of itself.”<a name="FnAnchor16_1" href="#Footnote16_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> After the words <i>reason Why</i>, Hamilton inserts the following additional words of his own in brackets — “but only the fact <i>That</i> they are given.”</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote16_1" id="Footnote16_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor16_1">1</a></span> Aristot. Topic. I. i. p. 100, a. 30; Hamilton’s Reid, p. 772, a.</p></div>
<p>
I demur to the words in brackets, as implying an hypothesis not
contained in Aristotle; who says only that the truth affirmed by the
teacher must be such as the learner is prepared to believe without
asking any questions. It may be an analytical truth (<i>sensu Kantiano</i>),
 in which the predicate asserts only what the learner knows to be
already contained in the definition of the subject. It may be a
synthetical truth; yet asserting only what he is familiar with by
constant, early, uncontradicted, obvious, experience. In either case, he
 is prepared to believe it at once; and thus the conditions of a First
Scientific Truth are satisfied, as here described by Aristotle; who says
 nothing about the truth <i>being given</i>.</p>
<p>
The next passage cited (<i>b</i>) is from the Analytica Posteriora (the reference is printed by mistake <i>Priora</i>).
 According to Hamilton, Aristotle says:—“We assert not only that science
 does exist, but also that there is given a certain beginning or
principle of science, <i>in so far as</i> (or, on another interpretation of the term &#8087; — <i>by which</i>) we recognize the import of the terms.”<a name="FnAnchor16_2" href="#Footnote16_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 I think Hamilton has not exactly rendered the sense of the original
when he translates it &mdash; “we recognize the import of the terms;” and he
proceeds to add expository words of his own which carry us still farther
 away from what I understand in Aristotle. If Hamilton’s rendering is
correct, all the <i>principia</i> of Science would be analytical propositions (<i>sensu Kantiano</i>),
 which I do not think that Aristotle intended to affirm or imply. In the
 last chapter of the Analytica Posteriora, Aristotle not only affirmed
that there were First Principles of Science, but described at length the
 inductive process by which we reached them: referring them ultimately
to the cognizance and approval of Noûs or Intellect. What Aristotle
means is, that, in ascending from propositions of lower to propositions
of higher universality, we know when we have reached the extreme term of
 ascent; and this forms the <i>principium</i>.</p>

<p>
Neither Philoponus, nor Buhle, nor M. Barthélemy St.-Hilaire, translate
the words &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#8005;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; in the same way as Sir W. Hamilton. It
rather seems to me that the words mean <i>terms or limits of regress</i>,
 which coincides with the paraphrase of Philoponus: &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179; &#947;&#8048;&#961; (&#964;&#8183; &#957;&#8183;)

13, Br.), as well as substantially with the note of M. St.-Hilaire.</p></div>
<p>
Sir W. Hamilton next gives us another passage (<i>c</i>) from the
Analytica Posteriora, in which Aristotle affirms that the First
Principles must be believed in a superlative degree, because we know and
 believe all secondary truths through them:<a name="FnAnchor16_3" href="#Footnote16_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
 a doctrine which appears to me to require both comment and limitation;
but about which I say nothing, because, even granting it to be true, I
do not see how it assists the purpose — to prove that Aristotle is the
champion of authoritative Common Sense. Nor do I find any greater proof
in another passage previously (p. 764, b.) produced from Aristotle: “Of
the immediate principles of syllogism, that which cannot be
demonstrated, but which it is not necessary to possess as the
pre-requisite of all learning, I call <i>Thesis</i>: and that <i>Axiom</i>,
 which he who would learn aught, must himself bring (and not receive
from his instructor). For some such principles there are; and it is to
these that we are accustomed to apply the name.”<a name="FnAnchor16_4" href="#Footnote16_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Such principles there doubtless are, which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>569</span>learner
 must bring with him; but Aristotle does not assert, much less prove,
that they are intuitions given by authoritative Common Sense. Nay, in
the passage cited in my former page, he both asserted and proved that
the <i>principia</i> of Science were raised from Sense by Induction. The learner, when he comes to be taught, must bring some of these <i>principia</i>
 with him, if he is to learn Science from his teacher; just as he must
also bring with him a knowledge of the language, of the structure of
sentences, of the forms for affirmation and denial, &amp;c., and various
 other requisites. A recruit, when first coming to be drilled, must
bring with him a certain power of walking and of making other movements
of the limbs. But these pre-requisites, on the part of the learner as
well as on that of the recruit, are not intuitive products or
inspirations of the mind: they are acquirements made by long and irksome
 experience, though often forgotten in its details. We are not to reason
 upon the learner or the recruit as if they were children just born.</p>

would have been better for him to do, because he founds upon the passage
 an argument to prove that Aristotle limited in a certain way the sense
of the word Axiom.</p></div>
<p>
The passages out of the Rhetorica and the Metaphysica (cited on p. 772, b., and marked <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>) are hardly worth notice. But that which immediately follows (marked <i>f</i>),
 out of the Nikomachean Ethica, is the most pertinent of all that are
produced. Hamilton writes:— “Arguing against a paradox of certain
Platonists in regard to the Pleasurable, Aristotle says — ‘But they who
oppose themselves to Eudoxus, as if what all nature desiderates were not
 a good, talk idly. For what <i>appears to all</i>, that we affirm <i>to be</i>; and he who would subvert this belief, will himself assuredly advance nothing more deserving of credit.’<a name="FnAnchor16_5" href="#Footnote16_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
 Compare also L. vii. c. 13 (14). In his paraphrase of the above
passage, the Pseudo-Andronicus in one place uses the expression <i>common opinion</i>,
 and in another all but uses (what indeed he could hardly do in this
meaning as an Aristotelian, if indeed in Greek at all) the expression <i>common sense</i>,
 which D. Heinsius in his Latin version actually employs.” Thus far
Hamilton; but the words of Aristotle which immediately follow are even
stronger:— “For, in so far as foolish creatures desire pleasure, the
objection taken would be worth something; but, when intelligent
creatures desire it also, how can the objectors make out their case?
Even in mean and foolish creatures, moreover, there is perhaps a certain
 good natural appetite, superior to themselves, which aims at their own
good.”<a name="FnAnchor16_6" href="#Footnote16_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
 Or as Aristotle (according to some critics, the Aristotelian Eudemus)
states it in the Seventh Book of the Nikomachean Ethica, referred to by
Sir W. Hamilton without citing it:— “Perhaps all creatures (brutes as
well as men) pursue, not that pleasure which they think they are
pursuing, nor what they would declare themselves to be pursuing, but all
 of them the same pleasure; for all creatures have by nature something
divine.”<a name="FnAnchor16_7" href="#Footnote16_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>
In this passage, Aristotle does really appear as the champion of
authoritative Common Sense. He enunciates the general principle: That
which appears to all, that we affirm to be. And he proceeds to claim
(with the qualification of <i>perhaps</i>) for this universal belief a
divine or quasi-divine authority; like Hesiod in the verses cited by Sir
 W. Hamilton, p. 770, b., and like Dr. Reid in the motto prefixed to his
 ‘Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense.’ If
Aristotle had often spoken in this way, he would have been pre-eminently
 suitable to figure in Sir W. Hamilton’s list of authorities. But the
reverse is the fact. In the Analytica and Topica, Aristotle is so far
from accepting the opinion and belief of all as a certificate of truth
and reality, that he expressly ranks the matters so certified as
belonging to the merely probable, and includes them in his definition
thereof. Universal belief counts for more or less, as a certificate of
the truth of what is believed, according to the matter to which it
refers; and there are few matters on which it is of greater value than
pleasure and pain. Yet even upon this point Aristotle rejects the
authority of the many, and calls upon us to repose implicit confidence
in the verdict of the just and intelligent individual, whom he enthrones
 as the measure. “Those alone are pleasures” (says Aristotle) “which
appear pleasures to this man; those alone <span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>are
 pleasant things in which he takes delight. If things which are
revolting to him appear pleasurable to others, we ought not to wonder,
since there are many corruptions and degenerations of mankind; yet these
 things are not really pleasurable, except to these men and to men of
like disposition.”<a name="FnAnchor16_8" href="#Footnote16_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
 This declaration, repeated more than once in the Nikomachean Ethica,
and supported by Analytica and Topica, more than countervails the
opposite opinion expressed by Aristotle, in the passage where he defends
 Eudoxus.</p>

The next passage (<i>g</i>) produced by Sir W. Hamilton is out of the
Eudemian Ethica. But this passage, when translated more fully and
exactly than we read it in his words, will be found to prove nothing to
the point which he aims at. He gives it as follows, p. 773, a.:— “But of
 all these we must endeavour to seek out rational grounds of belief, by
adducing manifest testimonies and authorities. For it is the strongest
evidence of a doctrine, if all men can be adduced as the manifest
confessors of its positions; because every individual has in him a kind
of private organ of the truth. Hence we ought not always to look to the
conclusions of reasoning, but frequently rather to what appears [and is
believed] to be.” The original is given below.<a name="FnAnchor16_9" href="#Footnote16_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>
The following is a literal translation, restoring what Sir W. Hamilton
omits:— “But, respecting all these matters, we must endeavour to seek
belief through general reasoning, employing the appearances before us (<i>i.e.</i> the current <i>dicta</i> and <i>facta</i>
 of society) as testimonies and examples. For it is best that all
mankind should be manifestly in agreement with what we are about to say;
 but, if that cannot be, that at all events they should be in some sort
of agreement with us; which they will come to be when brought round (by
being addressed in the proper style). For every man has in him some
tendencies favourable to the truth, and it is out of these that we must
somehow or other prove our conclusions. By taking our departure from
what is said around us truly but not clearly, we shall by gradual
advance introduce clearness, taking along with us such portion of the
confused common talk as is most congruous to Science.… It is well also
to consider apart the causal reasoning (syllogistic, deductive
premisses), and the conclusion shown: first, upon the ground just
stated, that we must not pay exclusive attention to the results of
deductive reasoning, but often rather to apparent facts, whereas it
often happens now that, when men cannot refute the reasoning, they feel
constrained to believe in the conclusion; next, because the conclusion,
shown by the reasoning, may often be true in itself, but not from the
cause assigned in the reasoning. For a true conclusion may be shown by
false premisses; as we have seen in the Analytica.”</p>
<p>
Whoever reads the original words of Aristotle (or Eudemus) will see how
much Sir W. Hamilton’s translation strains their true meaning. &#922;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;
 does not correspond to the phrase — “it is the strongest evidence of a
doctrine.” &#922;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; is the equivalent of &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;, as we find in chap.
iii. of this Book of the Eudemian Ethica (p. 1215, a. 3): &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#948;’ &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054;&#957;

&#7936;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; to be translated — “a kind of private organ of the truth:” they
 mean simply — “something in him favourable or tending towards the
truth,” as we read in chap. ii. of this same Book — &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#949;&#8016;&#949;&#958;&#943;&#945;&#957;
 (p. 1214, b. 22). Moreover, Hamilton has omitted to translate both the
words preceding and the words following; accordingly he has missed the
real sense of the passage. Aristotle inculcates upon the philosopher
never to neglect the common and prevalent opinions, but to acquaint
himself with them carefully; because, though these opinions are
generally full of confusion and error (&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8135; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#963;&#967;&#949;&#948;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#7937;&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; (&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;) — Ethic. Eudem. I. iii. p. 1215, a. 1), he will find
 in them partial correspondences with the truth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span>of
 which he may avail himself to bring the common minds round to better
views; but, unless he knows pretty well what the opinions of these
common minds are, he will not be able to address them persuasively. This
 is the same reasonable view which Aristotle expresses at the beginning
of the Topica (in a passage already cited, above), respecting the manner
 of dealing proper for a philosopher towards current opinion. But it
does not at all coincide with the representation given by Hamilton.</p>
<p>
The next piece of evidence (<i>h</i>) which we find tendered is another
passage out of the Eudemian Ethica. It will be seen that this passage is
 strained with even greater violence than the preceding. Hamilton writes
 as follows, first translating the words of Aristotle, then commenting
on them:— “The problem is this — What is the beginning or principle of
motion in the soul? Now it is evident, as God is in the universe, and
the universe in God, that [I read &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#943; — W. H.] the divinity in us
 is also, in a certain sort, the universal mover of the mind. For the
principle of Reason is not Reason but something better. Now what can we
say is better than even Science, except God?”<a name="FnAnchor16_10" href="#Footnote16_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
 So far Hamilton’s translation; now follows his comment:— “The import of
 this singular passage is very obscure. It has excited, I see, the
attention, and exercised the ingenuity, of Pomponatius, J. C. Scaliger,
De Raei, Leibnitz, Leidenfrost, Jacobi, &amp;c. But without viewing it
as of pantheistic tendency, as Leibnitz is inclined to do, it may be
interpreted as a declaration, that Intellect, which Aristotle elsewhere
allows to be pre-existent and immortal, is a spark of the Divinity;
whilst its data (from which as principles more certain than their
deductions, Reason, Demonstration, Science, must depart) are to be
reverenced as the revelation of truths which would otherwise lie hid
from man: That, in short, </p>

<p class="noind">By the bye, it is remarkable that this text was not
employed by any of those Aristotelian philosophers who endeavoured to
identify the Active Intellect with the Deity.”</p>

<p>
I maintain that this passage noway justifies the interpretation whereby
Sir W. Hamilton ascribes to Aristotle a doctrine so large and important.
 The acknowledged obscurity of the passage might have rendered any
interpreter cautious of building much upon it: but this is not all: Sir
W. Hamilton has translated it separately, without any allusion to the
chapter of which it forms part. This is a sure way of misunderstanding
it; for it cannot be fairly construed except as bearing on the problem
enunciated and discussed in that chapter. Aristotle (or Eudemus)
propounds for discussion explicitly in this chapter a question which had
 been adverted to briefly in the earlier part of the Eudemian Ethica (I.
 i. p. 1214, a. 24) — What is the relation between good fortune and
happiness? Upon what does good fortune depend? Is it produced by special
 grace or inspiration from the Gods? This question is taken up and
debated at length in the chapter from which Sir W. Hamilton has made his
 extract. It is averred, as a matter of notoriety, that some men are
fortunate. Though fools, they are constantly successful — more so than
wiser men; and this characteristic is so steady, that men count upon it
and denominate them accordingly. (See this general belief illustrated in
 the debate at Athens recorded by Thukydides, vi. 17, the good fortune
of Nikias being admitted even by his opponents.) Upon what does this
good fortune depend? Upon nature? Upon intelligence? Upon fortune
herself as a special agent? Upon the grace and favour of the gods to the
 fortunate individual? Aristotle (or Eudemus) discusses the problem in a
 long and perplexed chapter, stating each hypothesis, together with the
difficulties and objections attaching to it. As far as we can make out
from an obscure style and a corrupt text, the following is the result
arrived at. There are two varieties of the fortunate man: one is, he who
 succeeds through a rightly directed impulse, under special inspiration
of the divine element within him and within all men; the other is, he
who succeeds without any such impulse, through the agency of Fortune
proper. The good fortune of the first is more constant than that of the
second; but both are alike irrational or extra-rational.<a name="FnAnchor16_11" href="#Footnote16_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Now the divine element <span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572"></a>572</span>in
 the soul is the beginning or principle of motion for all the
manifestations in the soul — for reason as well as feeling: that which
calls reason into operation, is something more powerful than reason. But
 in the intelligent man this divine mover only calls reason into
operation, leaving reason, when once in operation, to its own force and
guidance, of course liable to err; whereas in the fortunate man (first
variety) the divine element inspires all his feelings and volitions,
without any rational deliberation, so that he executes exactly the right
 thing at the right time and place, and accordingly succeeds.<a name="FnAnchor16_12" href="#Footnote16_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

(II. iv. p. 196, a. 4), where Aristotle again discusses &#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;: the case
of a man who comes to the market-place on his ordinary business, and
there by accident meets a friend whom he particularly wished to see, but
 whom he never dreamt of seeing there and then.</p></div>

<p>
Aristotle (or Eudemus) thus obtains a psychological explanation (good or
 bad) of the fact, that there are fools who constantly succeed in their
purposes, and wise men who frequently fail. He tells us that there is in
 the soul a divine principle of motion, which calls every thing — reason
 as well as appetite or feeling — into operation. But he says nothing of
 what Sir W. Hamilton ascribes to him — about Intellect as a spark of
the Divinity, or about data of Intellect to be reverenced as the
revelation of hidden truths. His drift is quite different and even
opposite: to account for the success of individuals <i>without intellect</i>
 or reason — to bring forward a divine element in the soul, which
dispenses with intellect, and which conducts these unintelligent men to
success, solely by infusing the most opportune feelings and impulses.
Sir W. Hamilton has misunderstood this passage, by taking no notice of
the context and general argument to which it belongs.</p>
<p>
Besides, when Hamilton represents Aristotle here as declaring: “That the
 data of Intellect are to be reverenced as the revelation of truths
which would otherwise lie hid from man” — how are we to reconcile this
with what we read two pages before (p. 771, a.) as the view of Aristotle
 about these same data of Intellect, that “they are themselves
pre-eminently certain; and, if denied in words, they are still always
mentally admitted”? Is it reasonable to say that the Maxim of
Contradiction, and the proposition, That if equals be subtracted from
equals, the remainders will be equal — are data “to be reverenced as the
 revelation of truths which would otherwise lie hid from man”? At any
rate, I protest against the supposition that Aristotle has ever declared
 this.</p>
<p>
The next two passages cited from Aristotle have really no bearing upon
the authority of Common Sense in its metaphysical meaning: they are (<i>i</i>) from Physic. VIII. iii. and (<i>k</i>)
 from De Gen. Animal. III. x. Both passages assert the authority of
sensible perception against general reasoning, where the two are
conflicting. They assert, in other words, that general reasoning ought
to be tested by experience and observation, and is not to be accepted
when disallowed by these tests. (The only condition is, that the
observation be exact and complete.) This is just, and is often said,
though often disregarded in fact, by Aristotle. But it has no proper
connexion with the problem about the trustworthiness of Common Sense.</p>
<p>
Next Sir W. Hamilton refers us to (without citing) three other places of
 Aristotle. Of these, the first (De Cœlo, I. iii. p. 270, b. 4-13,
marked <i>l</i>) is one which I am much surprised to find in a modern
champion of Common Sense: since it represents Common Sense as giving
full certificate to errors now exploded and forgotten. Aristotle had
begun by laying down and vindicating his doctrine of the First or
Celestial Body, forming the exterior portion of the Kosmos, radically
distinct from the four elements; revolving eternally in uniform,
perfect, circular motion, eternal, unchangeable, &amp;c. Having stated
this, he proceeds to affirm that the results of these reasonings
coincide with the common opinions of mankind, that is, with Common
Sense; and that they are not contradicted by any known observations of
perceptive experience. This illustrates what I have before observed
about Aristotle’s position in regard to Common Sense. He does not extol
it as an authority, or tell us that “it is to be reverenced as a
revelation”; but, when he has proved a conclusion on what he thinks good
 grounds, he is glad to be able to show that it tallies with common
opinions; especially when these opinions have some alliance with the
received religion.</p>
<p>
The next passage (<i>m</i>) referred to (De Cœlo, III. vii. p. 306, a.
13) has nothing to do with Common Sense, but embodies a very just
protest by Aristotle against those philosophers who followed out their
theories consistently to all possible consequences, without troubling
themselves to enquire whether those consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span> were in harmony with the results of observation.</p>
<p>
There follows one other reference (<i>n</i>) which was hardly worth Sir
W. Hamilton’s notice. In Meteorologic. I. xiii. p. 349, a. 25,
Aristotle, after reciting a theory of some philosophers (respecting the
winds) which he considers very absurd, then proceeds to say:— “The many,
 without going into any enquiry at all, talk better sense than those who
 after enquiry bring forward such conclusions as these.” It is not
saying much for the authority of Common Sense, to affirm that there have
 been occasionally philosophical theories so silly as to be worse than
Common Sense.</p>

<p>
</p>
<h2>B. — <i>Aristotle’s Doctrine.</i></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>In regard to Aristotle, there are two points to be examined — </p>
<p>
I. What position does he take up in respect to the authority of Common Sense? </p>
<p>
II. What doctrine does he lay down about the first <i>principia</i> or beginnings of scientific reasoning — the &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;? </p>
<p>
I. — That Aristotle did not regard Cause, Substance, Time, &amp;c., as
Intuitions, is shown by the subtle and elaborate reasonings that he
employs to explain them, and by the censure that he bestows on the
erroneous explanations and shortcomings of others. Indeed, in regard to
Causality, when we read the great and perplexing diversity of meaning
which Aristotle (and Plato before him in the Phædon) recognizes as
belonging to this term, we cannot but be surprised to find modern
philosophers treating it as enunciating a simple and intuitive idea. But
 as to Common Sense — taking the term as above explained, and as it is
usually understood by those that have no particular theory to support —
Aristotle takes up a position at once distinct and instructive; a
position (to use the phraseology of Kant) not dogmatical, but critical.
He constantly notices and reports the affirmations of Common Sense; he
speaks of it with respect, and assigns to it a qualified value, partly
as helping us to survey the subject on all sides, partly as a happy
confirmation, where it coincides with what has been proved otherwise;
but he does not appeal to it as an authority in itself trustworthy or
imperative.</p>
<p>
Common Sense belongs to the region of Opinion. Now the distinction
between matters of Opinion on the one hand, and matters of Science or
Cognition on the other, is a marked and characteristic feature of
Aristotle’s philosophy. He sets, in pointed antithesis, Demonstration,
or the method of Science — which divides itself into special subjects,
each having some special <i>principia</i> of its own, then proceeds by legitimate steps of deductive reasoning from such <i>principia</i>,
 and arrives at conclusions sometimes universally true, always true for
the most part — against Rhetoric and Dialectic, which deal with and
discuss opinions upon all subjects, comparing opposite arguments, and
landing in results more or less probable. Contrasting them as separate
lines of intellectual procedure, Aristotle lays down a theory of both.
He recognizes the procedure of Rhetoric and Dialectic as being to a
great degree the common and spontaneous growth of society; while
Demonstration is from the beginning special, not merely as to subject,
but as to persons, implying teacher and learner.</p>
<p>
Rhetoric and Dialectic are treated by Aristotle as analogous processes.
Of the matter of opinion and belief, with which both of them deal, he
distinguishes three varieties: (1) Opinions or beliefs entertained by
all; (2) By the majority; (3) By a minority of superior men, or by one
man in respect to a science wherein he has acquired renown. It is these
opinions or beliefs that the rhetorician and the dialectician attack and
 defend; bringing out all the arguments available for or against each.</p>
<p>
The Aristotelian treatise on Rhetoric opens with the following words:—
“Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic; for both of them deal with
such matters as do not fall within any special science, but belong in a
certain way to the common knowledge of all. Hence every individual has
his share of both, greater or less; for every one can, up to a certain
point, both examine others and stand examination from others; every one
tries to defend himself and to accuse others.”<a name="FnAnchor16_13" href="#Footnote16_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
 To the same purpose Aristotle speaks about Dialectic, in the beginning
of the Topica:— “The dialectical syllogism takes its premisses from
matters of opinion, that is, from matters that seem good to (or are
believed by) all, or the majority, or the wise — either all the wise, or
 most of them, or the most celebrated.” Aristotle distinguishes these
matters of common opinion or belief from three distinct other matters:—
(1) From <span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>matters
 that are not really such, but only in appearance; in which the smallest
 attention suffices to detect the false pretence of probability, while
no one except a contentious Sophist ever thinks of advancing them; on
the contrary, the real matters of common belief are never thus palpably
false, but have always something deeper than a superficial show; (2)
From the first truths or <i>principia</i>, upon which scientific
demonstration proceeds; (3) From the paralogisms, or fallacious
assumptions (&#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;), liable to occur in each particular
science.</p>
<p>
Now what Aristotle here designates and defines as “matters of common
opinion and belief” (&#964;&#8048; &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;) includes all that is usually meant, and
properly meant, by Common Sense — what is believed by all men or by most
 men. But Aristotle does not claim any warrant or authority for the
truth of these beliefs, on the ground of their being deliverances of
Common Sense, and accepted (by all or by the majority) always as
indisputable, often as self-evident. On the contrary, he ranks them as
mere probabilities, some in a greater, some in a less degree; as matters
 whereon something may be said both <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, and
whereon the full force of argument on both sides ought to be brought
out, notwithstanding the supposed self-evidence in the minds of
unscientific believers. Though, however, he encourages this dialectical
discussion on both sides as useful and instructive, he never affirms
that it can by itself lead to certain scientific conclusions, or to
anything more than strong probability on a balance of the countervailing
 considerations. The language that he uses in speaking of these
deliverances of Common Sense is measured and just. After distinguishing
the real Common Opinion from the fallacious simulations of Common
Opinion set up (according to him) by some pretenders, he declares that
in all cases of Common Opinion there is always something more than a
mere superficial appearance of truth. In other words, wherever any
opinion is really held by a large public, it always deserves the
scrutiny of the philosopher to ascertain how far it is erroneous, and,
if it be erroneous, by what appearances of reason it has been enabled so
 far to prevail.</p>

<p>
Again, at the beginning of the Topica (in which he gives both a theory
and precepts of dialectical debate), Aristotle specifies four different
ends to be served by that treatise. It will be useful (he says) — </p>
<p>
1. For our own practice in the work of debate. If we acquire a method
and system, we shall find it easier to conduct a debate on any new
subject, whenever such debate may arise.</p>
<p>
2. For our daily intercourse with the ordinary public. When we have made
 for ourselves a full collection of the opinions held by the many, we
shall carry on our conversation with them out of their own doctrines,
and not out of doctrines foreign to their minds; we shall thus be able
to bring them round on any matter where we think them in error.</p>
<p>
3. For the sciences belonging to philosophy. By discussing the
difficulties on both sides, we shall more easily discriminate truth and
falsehood in each separate scientific question.</p>
<p>
4. For the first and highest among the <i>principia</i> of each particular science. These, since they are the first and highest of all, cannot be discussed out of <i>principia</i>
 special and peculiar to any separate science; but must be discussed
through the opinions commonly received on the subject-matter of each.
This is the main province of Dialectic; which, being essentially testing
 and critical, is connected by some threads with the <i>principia</i> of all the various scientific researches.</p>
<p>
We see thus that Aristotle’s language about Common Opinion or Common
Sense is very guarded; that, instead of citing it as an authority, he
carefully discriminates it from Science, and places it decidedly on a
level lower than Science, in respect of evidence; yet that he recognizes
 it as essential to be studied by the scientific man, with full
confrontation of all the reasonings both for and against every opinion;
not merely because such study will enable the scientific man to study
and converse intelligibly and efficaciously with the vulgar, but also
because it will sharpen his discernment for the truths of his own
science, and because it furnishes the only materials for testing and
limiting the first <i>principia</i> of that science. </p>
<p>
II. We will next advert to the judgment of Aristotle respecting these <i>principia</i>
 of science: how he supposes them to be acquired and verified. He
discriminates various special sciences (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy,
 &amp;c.), each of which has its own appropriate matter, and special <i>principia</i> from which it takes its departure. But there are also certain <i>principia</i>
 common to them all; and these he considers to fall under the cognizance
 of one grand comprehensive science, which includes all the rest; First
Philosophy or Ontology — the science of Ens in its most general sense, <i>quatenus</i> Ens; while each of the separate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>575</span>sciences confines itself to one exclusive department of Ens. The geometer does not debate nor prove the first <i>principia</i>
 of his own science; neither those that it has in common with other
sciences, nor those peculiar to itself. He takes these for granted, and
demonstrates the consequences that logically follow from them. It
belongs to the First Philosopher to discuss the <i>principia</i> of all.
 Accordingly, the province of the First Philosopher is
all-comprehensive, co-extensive with all the sciences. So also is the
province of the Dialectician alike all-comprehensive. Thus far the two
agree; but they differ as to method and purpose. The Dialectician seeks
to enforce, confront, and value all the different reasons <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,
 consistent and inconsistent; the First Philosopher performs this too,
or supposes it to be performed by others, but proceeds farther: namely,
to determine certain Axioms that may be trusted as sure grounds (along
with certain other <i>principia</i>) for demonstrative conclusions in science.</p>
<p>
Aristotle describes in his Analytica the process of Demonstration, and
the conditions required to render it valid. But what is the point of
departure for this process? Aristotle declares that there cannot be a
regress without end, demonstrating one conclusion from certain
premisses, then demonstrating those premisses from others, and so on.
You must arrive ultimately at some premisses that are themselves
undemonstrable, but that may be trusted as ground from whence to start
in demonstrating conclusions. All demonstration is carried on through a
middle term, which links together the two terms of the conclusion,
though itself does not appear in the conclusion. Those undemonstrable
propositions, from which demonstration begins, must be known without a
middle term, that is, <i>immediately</i> known; they must be known in
themselves, that is, not through any other propositions; they must be
better known than the conclusions derived from them; they must be
propositions first and most knowable. But these two last epithets
(Aristotle often repeats) have two meanings: first and most knowable <i>by nature</i> or <i>absolutely</i>, are the most universal propositions; first and most knowable <i>to us</i>,
 are those propositions declaring the particular facts of sense. These
two meanings designate truths correlative to each other, but at opposite
 ends of the intellectual line of march.</p>
<p>
Of these undemonstrable <i>principia</i>, indispensable as the grounds
of all Demonstration, some are peculiar to each separate science, others
 are common to several or to all sciences. These common principles were
called Axioms, in mathematics, even in the time of Aristotle. Sometimes,
 indeed, he designates them as Axioms, without any special reference to
mathematics; though he also uses the same name to denote other
propositions, not of the like fundamental character. Now, how do we come
 to know these undemonstrable Axioms and other immediate propositions or
 <i>principia</i>, since we do not knew them by demonstration? This is
the second question to be answered, in appreciating Aristotle’s views
about the Philosophy of Common Sense.</p>
<p>
He is very explicit in his way of answering this question. He pronounces it absurd to suppose that these immediate <i>principia</i>
 are innate or congenital, — in other words, that we possess them from
the beginning, and yet that we remain for a long time without any
consciousness of possessing them; seeing that they are the most accurate
 of all our cognitions. What we possess at the beginning (Aristotle
says) is only a mental power of inferior accuracy and dignity. We, as
well as all other animals, begin with a congenital discriminative power
called sensible perception. With many animals, the data of perception
are transient, and soon disappear altogether, so that the cognition of
such animals consists in nothing but successive acts of sensible
perception. With us, on the contrary, as with some other animals, the
data of perception are preserved by memory; accordingly our cognitions
include both perceptions and remembrances. Farthermore, we are
distinguished even from the better animals by this difference — that
with us, but not with them, a rational order of thought grows out of
such data of perception, when multiplied and long preserved. And thus
out of perception grows memory; out of memory of the same matter often
repeated grows experience, since many remembrances of the same thing
constitute one numerical experience. Out of such experience, a farther
consequence arises, that what is one and the same in all the
particulars, (the Universal or the One alongside of the Many), becomes
fixed or rests steadily within the mind. Herein lies the <i>principium</i> of Art, in reference to Agenda or Facienda — of Science, in reference to Entia.</p>
<p>
Thus these cognitive <i>principia</i> are not original and determinate
possessions of the mind, nor do they spring from any other mental
possessions of a higher cognitive order, but simply from data of
sensible perception; which data are like runaway soldiers in a panic,
first one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>stops
 his flight and halts, then a second follows the example, afterwards a
third and fourth, until at length an orderly array is obtained. Our
minds are so constituted as to render this possible. If a single
individual impression is thus detained, it will presently acquire the
character of a Universal in the mind; for, though we perceive the
particular, our perception is of the Universal (<i>i.e.</i>, when we
perceive Kallias, our perception is of man generally, not of the man
Kallias). Again the fixture of these lowest Universals in the mind will
bring in those of the next highest order; until at length the Summa
Genera and the absolute Universals acquire a steady establishment
therein. Thus, from this or that particular animal, we shall rise as
high as Animal universally; and so on from Animal upwards.</p>
<p>
We thus see clearly (Aristotle says) that only by Induction can we come to know the first <i>principia</i> of Demonstration; for it is by this process that sensible perception engraves the Universal on our minds.<a name="FnAnchor16_14" href="#Footnote16_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> We begin by the <i>notiora nobis</i> (Particulars), and ascend to the <i>notiora naturâ</i> or <i>simpliciter</i>
 (Universals). Some among our mental habits that are conversant with
truth, are also capable of falsehood (such as Opinion and Reasoning):
others are not so capable, but embrace uniformly truth and nothing but
truth; such are Science and Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;). Intellect is the only
source more accurate than Science. Now the <i>principia</i> of
Demonstration are more accurate than the demonstrations themselves, yet
they cannot (as we have already observed) be the objects of Science.
They must therefore be the object of what is more accurate than Science,
 namely, of Intellect. Intellect and the objects of Intellect will thus
be the <i>principia</i> of Science and of the objects of Science. But
these principles are not intuitive data or revelations. They are
acquisitions gradually made; and there is a regular road whereby we
travel up to them, quite distinct from the road whereby we travel down
from them to scientific conclusions.</p>

&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;; also ibid. I. xviii., p. 81, b. 3, upon which passage Waitz, in
 his note, explains as follows (p. 347):— “Sententia nostri loci hæc
est. Universales propositiones omnes inductione comparantur, quum etiam
in iis, quæ a sensibus maxime aliena videntur, et quæ, ut mathematica
(&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#958; &#7936;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;), cogitatione separantur a materia quacum conjuncta
sunt, inductione probentur ea quæ de genere (<i>e.g.</i>, de linea vel
de corpore mathematico), ad quod demonstratio pertineat, prædicentur
&#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#940; et cum ejus natura conjuncta sint. Inductio autem iis nititur
quæ sensibus percipiuntur: nam res singulares sentiuntur, scientia vero
rerum singularium non datur sine inductione, non datur inductio sine
sensu.”</p></div>
<p>
The chapter just indicated in the Analytica Posteriora, attesting the growth of those universals that form the <i>principia</i>
 of demonstration out of the particulars of sense, may be illustrated by
 a similar statement in the First Book of the Metaphysica. Here, after
stating that sensible perception is common to all animals, Aristotle
distinguishes the lowest among animals, who have this alone; then, a
class next above them, who have it along with phantasy and memory, and
some of whom are intelligent (like bees), yet still cannot learn, from
being destitute of hearing; farther another class, one stage higher, who
 hear, and therefore can be taught something, yet arrive only at a
scanty sum of experience; lastly, still higher, the class men, who
possess a large stock of phantasy, memory, and experience, fructifying
into science and art.<a name="FnAnchor16_15" href="#Footnote16_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
 Experience (Aristotle says) is of particular facts; Art and Science are
 of Universals. Art is attained, when out of many conceptions of
experience there arises one universal persuasion respecting phenomena
similar to each other. We may know that Kallias, sick of a certain
disease — that Sokrates, likewise sick of it — that A, B, C, and other
individuals besides, have been cured by a given remedy; but this
persuasion respecting ever so many individual cases, is mere matter of
experience. When, however, we proceed to generalize these cases, and
then affirm that the remedy cures all persons suffering under the same
disease, circumscribed by specific marks — fever or biliousness — this
is Art or Science. One man may know the particular cases empirically,
without having generalized them into a doctrine; another may have learnt
 the general doctrine, with little or no knowledge of the particular
cases. Of these two, the last is the wiser and more philosophical man;
but the first may be the more effective and successful as a
practitioner.</p>

We remark here the line that he draws between the intelligence of bees —
 depending altogether upon sense, memory, and experience — and the
higher intelligence which is superadded by the use of language; when it
becomes possible to teach and learn, and when general conceptions can be
 brought into view through appropriate names.</p></div>
<p>
In the passage above noticed, Aristotle draws the line of intellectual
distinction between man and the lower animals. If he had considered that
 it was the prerogative<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
 of man to possess a stock of intuitive general truths, ready-made, and
independent of experience, this was the occasion for saying so. He says
the exact contrary. No modern psychologist could proclaim more fully
than Aristotle here does the derivation of all general concepts and
general propositions from the phenomena of sense, through the successive
 stages of memory, association, comparison, abstraction. No one could
give a more explicit acknowledgment of Induction from particulars of
sense, as the process whereby we reach ultimately those propositions of
the highest universality, as well as of the highest certainty; from
whence, by legitimate deductive syllogism, we descend to demonstrate
various conclusions. There is nothing in Aristotle about generalities
originally inherent in the mind, connate although dormant at first and
unknown, until they are evoked or elicited by the senses; nothing to
countenance that nice distinction eulogized so emphatically by Hamilton
(p. 772, a. note): “Cognitio nostra omnis à mente primam originem, à
sensibus exordium habet primum.” In Aristotle’s view, the senses furnish
 both <i>originem</i> and <i>exordium</i>: the successive stages of
mental procedure, whereby we rise from sense to universal propositions,
are multiplied and gradual, without any break. He even goes so far as to
 say that we have <i>sensible perception</i> of the Universal. His
language undoubtedly calls for much criticism here. We shall only say
that it discountenances altogether the doctrine that represents the Mind
 or Intellect as an original source of First or Universal Truths
peculiar to itself. That opinion is mentioned by Aristotle, but
mentioned only to be rejected. He denies that the mind possesses any
such ready-made stores, latent until elicited into consciousness.
Moreover, it is remarkable that the ground whereon he denies it is much
the same as that whereon the advocates of intuitions affirm it, viz.,
the supreme accuracy of these axioms. Aristotle cannot believe that the
mind includes cognitions of such value, without being conscious thereof.
 Nor will he grant that the mind possesses any native and inherent power
 of originating these inestimable <i>principia</i>.<a name="FnAnchor16_16" href="#Footnote16_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
 He declares that they are generated in the mind only by the slow
process of induction, as above described; beginning from the perceptive
power (common to man with animals), together with that first stage of
the intelligence (judging or discriminative) which he combines or
identifies with perception, considering it to be alike congenital. From
this humble basis men can rise to the highest grades of cognition,
though animals cannot. We even become competent (Aristotle says) to have
 sensible perception of the Universal; in the man Kallias, we see Man;
in the ox feeding near us, we see Animal.</p>

See Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span> ix. p. 993, a. 1.</p>
<p>
Some modern psychologists, who admit that general propositions of a
lower degree of universality are raised from induction and sense,
contend that propositions of the highest universality are not so raised,
 but are the intuitive offspring of the intellect. Aristotle does not
countenance such a doctrine: he says (Metaphys. <span class="smcap">A.</span>
 ii. p. 982, a. 25) that these truths furthest removed from sense are
the most difficult to know of all. If they were intuitions they would be
 the common possession of the race.</p></div>
<p>
It must be remembered that, when Aristotle, in this analysis of
cognition, speaks of Induction, he means induction completely and
accurately performed; just as, when he talks of Demonstration, he
intends a good and legitimate demonstration; and just as (to use his own
 illustration in the Nikomachean Ethica), when he reasons upon a harper,
 or other professional artist, he always tacitly implies a good and
accomplished artist. Induction thus understood, and Demonstration, he
considers to be the two processes for obtaining scientific faith or
conviction; both of them being alike cogent and necessary, but Induction
 even more so than Demonstration; because, if the <i>principia</i>
furnished by the former were not necessary, neither could the
conclusions deduced from them by the latter be necessary. Induction may
thus stand alone without Demonstration, but Demonstration pre-supposes
and postulates Induction. Accordingly, when Aristotle proceeds to
specify those functions of mind wherewith the inductive <i>principia</i>
 and the demonstrated conclusions correlate, he refers both of them to
functions wherein (according to him) the mind is unerring and infallible
 — Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) and Science. But, between these two he ranks
Intellect as the higher, and he refers the inductive <i>principia</i> to
 Intellect. He does not mean that Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) generates or produces
 these principles. On the contrary, he distinctly negatives such a
supposition, and declares that no generative force of this high order
resides in the Intellect; while he tells us, with equal distinctness,
that they are generated from a lower source — sensible perception, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>578</span>and
 through the gradual upward march of the inductive process. To say that
they originate from Sense through Induction, and nevertheless to refer
them to Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) as their subjective correlate, — are not
positions inconsistent with each other, in the view of Aristotle. He
expressly distinguishes the two points, as requiring to be separately
dealt with. By referring the <i>principia</i> to Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;), he
does not intend to indicate their generating source, but their
evidentiary value and dignity when generated and matured. They possess,
in his view, the maximum of dignity, certainty, cogency, and necessity,
because it is from them that even Demonstration derives the necessity of
 its conclusions; accordingly (pursuant to the inclination of the
ancient philosophers for presuming affinity and commensurate dignity
between the <i>cognitum</i> and the <i>cognoscens</i>), they belong as
objective correlates to the most unerring cognitive function — the
Intellect (&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;). It is the Intellect that grasps these principles, and
applies them to their legitimate purpose of scientific demonstration;
hence Aristotle calls Intellect not only the <i>principium</i> of Science, but the <i>principium principii</i>.</p>
<p>
In the Analytica, from which we have hitherto cited, Aristotle explains
the structure of the Syllogism and the process of Demonstration. He has
in view mainly (though not exclusively) the more exact sciences,
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, &amp;c. But he expressly tells us that
all departments of inquiry are not capable of this exactness; that some
come nearer to it than others; that we must be careful to require no
more exactness from each than the subject admits; and that the method
adopted by us must be such as will attain the admissible maximum of
exactness. Now each subject has some <i>principia</i>, and among them definitions, peculiar to itself; though there are also some <i>principia</i> common to all, and essential to the march of each. In some departments of study (Aristotle says) we get our view of <i>principia</i>
 or first principles by induction; in others, by sensible perception; in
 others again, by habitual action in a certain way; and by various other
 processes also. In each, it is important to look for first principles
in the way naturally appropriate to the matter before us; for this is
more than half of the whole work; upon right first principles will
mainly depend the value of our conclusions. For what concerns Ethics,
Aristotle tells us that the first principles are acquired through a
course of well-directed habitual action; and that they will be acquired
easily, as well as certainly, if such a course be enforced on youth from
 the beginning. In the beginning of the Physica, he starts from that
antithesis, so often found in his writings, between what is more
knowable to us and what is more knowable absolutely or by nature. The
natural march of knowledge is to ascend from the first of these two
termini (particulars of sense) upward to the second or opposite,<a name="FnAnchor16_17" href="#Footnote16_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
 and then to descend downward by demonstration or deduction. The fact of
 motion he proves (against Melissus and Parmenides) by an express appeal
 to induction, as sufficient and conclusive evidence. In physical
science (he says) the final appeal must be to the things and facts
perceived by sense. In the treatise De Cœlo he lays it down that the <i>principia</i> must be homogeneous with the matters they belong to: the <i>principia</i>
 of perceivable matters must be themselves perceivable; those of eternal
 matters must be eternal; those of perishable matters, perishable.</p>

<p>
The treatises composing the Organon stand apart among Aristotle’s works.
 In them he undertakes (for the first time in the history of mankind)
the systematic study of significant propositions enunciative of truth
and falsehood. He analyses their constituent elements; he specifies the
conditions determining the consistency or inconsistency of such
propositions one with another; he teaches to arrange the propositions in
 such ways as to detect and dismiss the inconsistent, keeping our hold
of the consistent. Here the signification of terms and propositions is
never out of sight: the facts and realities of nature are regarded as so
 signified. Now all language becomes significant only through the
convention of mankind, according to Aristotle’s express declaration: it
is used by speakers to communicate what they mean to hearers that
understand them. We see thus that in these treatises the subjective
point of view is brought into the foreground — the enunciation of what
we see, remember, believe, disbelieve, doubt, anticipate, &amp;c. It is
not meant that the objective point of view is eliminated, but that it is
 taken in implication with, and in dependence upon, the subjective.
Neither the one nor the other is dropped or hidden. It is under this
double and conjoint point of view that Aristotle, in the Organon,
presents to us, not only the processes of demonstration and confutation,
 but also the fundamental <i>principia</i> or axioms thereof; which axioms in the Analytica Posteriora (as we have already seen) he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page579" id="page579"></a>579</span>expressly declares to originate from the data of sense, and to be raised and generalized by induction.</p>
<p>
Such is the way that Aristotle represents the fundamental principles of
syllogistic Demonstration, when he deals with them as portions of Logic.
 But we also find him dealing with them as portions of Ontology or First
 Philosophy (this being his manner of characterizing his own treatise,
now commonly known as the Metaphysica). To that science he decides,
after some preliminary debate, that the task of formulating and
defending the axioms belongs, because the application of these axioms is
 quite universal, for all grades and varieties of Entia. Ontology treats
 of Ens in its largest sense, with all its properties <i>quatenus</i>
Ens, including Unum, Multa, Idem, Diversum, Posterius, Prius, Genus,
Species, Totum, Partes, &amp;c. Now Ontology is with Aristotle a purely
objective science; that is, a science wherein the subjective is dropt
out of sight and no account taken of it, or wherein (to state the same
fact in the language of relativity) the believing and reasoning subject
is supposed constant. Ontology is the most comprehensive among all the
objective sciences. Each of these sciences singles out a certain portion
 of it for special study. In treating the logical axioms as portions of
Ontology, Aristotle undertakes to show their objective value; and this
purpose, while it carries him away from the point of view that we
remarked as prevailing in the Organon, at the same time brings him into
conflict with various theories, all of them in his time more or less
current. Several philosophers — Herakleitus, Anaxagoras, Demokritus,
Protagoras — had propounded theories which Aristotle here impugns. We do
 not mean that these philosophers expressly denied his fundamental
axioms (which they probably never distinctly stated to themselves, and
which Aristotle was the first to formulate), but their theories were to a
 certain extent inconsistent with these axioms, and were regarded by
Aristotle as wholly inconsistent.</p>
<p>
The two Axioms announced in the Metaphysica, and vindicated by Aristotle, are — </p>
<p>
1. The Maxim of Contradiction: It is impossible for the same thing to be
 and not to be; It is impossible for the same to belong and not to
belong to the same, at the same time and in the same sense. This is the
statement of the Maxim as a formula of Ontology. Announced as a formula
of Logic, it would stand thus: The same proposition cannot be both true
and false at the same time; You cannot both believe and disbelieve the
same proposition at the same time; You cannot believe, at the same time,
 propositions contrary or contradictory. These last-mentioned formulae
are the logical ways of stating the axiom. They present it in reference
to the believing or disbelieving (affirming or denying) subject,
distinctly brought to view along with the matter believed; not
exclusively in reference to the matter believed, to the omission of the
believer.</p>
<p>
2. The Maxim of Excluded Middle: A given attribute either does belong, or does not belong to a subject (<i>i.e.</i>,
 provided that it has any relation to the subject at all) — there is no
medium, no real condition intermediate between the two. This is the
ontological formula; and it will stand thus, when translated into Logic:
 Between a proposition and its contradictory opposite there is no
tenable halting ground; If you disbelieve the one, you must pass at once
 to the belief of the other — you cannot at the same time disbelieve the
 other.</p>
<p>
These two maxims thus teach — the first, that we cannot at the same time <i>believe</i> both a proposition and its contradictory opposite; the second, that we cannot at the same time <i>disbelieve</i> them both.<a name="FnAnchor16_18" href="#Footnote16_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote16_18" id="Footnote16_18"></a><a href="#FnAnchor16_18">18</a></span>
 We have here discussed these two maxims chiefly in reference to
Aristotle’s manner of presenting them, and to the conceptions of his
predecessors and contemporaries. An excellent view of the Maxims
themselves, in their true meaning and value, will be found in Mr. John
Stuart Mill’s Examination of the Philosophy of Sir W. Hamilton, ch. xxi.
 pp. 406-421.</p></div>
<p>
Now, Herakleitus, in his theory (a theory propounded much before the
time of Protagoras and the persons called Sophists), denied all
permanence or durability in nature, and recognized nothing except
perpetual movement and change. He denied both durable substances and
durable attributes; he considered nothing to be lasting except the
universal law or principle of change — the ever-renewed junction or
co-existence of contraries and the perpetual transition of one contrary
into the other. This view of the facts of nature was adopted by several
other physical philosophers besides.<a name="FnAnchor16_19" href="#Footnote16_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
 Indeed it lay at the bottom of Plato’s new coinage — Rational Types or
Forms, at once universal and real. The Maxim of Contradiction is
intended by Aristotle to controvert Herakleitus, and to uphold durable
substances with definite attributes.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote16_19" id="Footnote16_19"></a><a href="#FnAnchor16_19">19</a></span> See ‘Plato and other Comp. of Sokr.’ I. i. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_1_24">pp. 28-38</a>.</p></div>
<p>
Again, the theory of Anaxagoras denied all simple bodies (excepting
Noûs) and all definite attributes. He held that everything was mingled
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page580" id="page580"></a>580</span>everything
 else, though there might be some one or other predominant constituent.
In all the changes visible throughout nature, there was no generation of
 anything new, but only the coming into prominence of some constituent
that had before been comparatively latent. According to this theory, you
 could neither wholly affirm, nor wholly deny, any attribute of its
subject. Both affirmation and denial were untrue: the real relation
between the two was something half-way between affirmation and denial.
The Maxim of Excluded Middle is maintained by Aristotle as a doctrine in
 opposition to this theory of Anaxagoras.<a name="FnAnchor16_20" href="#Footnote16_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote16_20" id="Footnote16_20"></a><a href="#FnAnchor16_20">20</a></span> Ibid. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_1_43">pp. 49-57</a>.</p></div>
<p>
Both the two above-mentioned theories are objective. A third, that of
Protagoras — “Homo Mensura” — brings forward prominently the subjective,
 and is quite distinct from either. Aristotle does indeed treat the
Protagorean theory as substantially identical with that of Herakleitus,
and as standing or falling therewith. This seems a mistake: the theory
of Protagoras is as much opposed to Herakleitus as to Aristotle.</p>
<p>
We have now to see how Aristotle sustains these two Axioms (which he
calls “the firmest of all truths and the most assuredly known”) against
theories opposed to them. In the first place, he repeats here what he
had declared in the Analytica Posteriora — that they cannot be directly
 demonstrated, though they are themselves the <i>principia</i> of all
demonstration. Some persons indeed thought that these Axioms were
demonstrable; but this is an error, proceeding (he says) from complete
ignorance of analytical theory. How, then, are these Axioms to be proved
 against Herakleitus? Aristotle had told us in the Analytica that axioms
 were derived from particulars of sense by Induction, and apprehended or
 approved by the &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;. He does not repeat that observation here; but he
intimates that there is only one process available for defending them,
and that process amounts to an appeal to Induction. You can give no
ontological reason in support of the Axioms, except what will be
condemned as a <i>petitio principii</i>; you must take them in their
logical aspect, as enunciated in significant propositions. You must
require the Herakleitean adversary to answer some question
affirmatively, in terms significant both to himself and to others, and
in a proposition declaring his belief on the point. If he will not do
this, you can hold no discussion with him: he might as well be deaf and
dumb: he is no better than a plant (to use Aristotle’s own comparison).
If he does it, he has bound himself to something determinate: first, the
 signification of the terms is a fact, excluding what is contrary or
contradictory; next, in declaring his belief, he at the same time
declares that he does not believe in the contrary or contradictory, and
is so understood by the hearers. We may grant what his theory affirms —
that the subject of a proposition is continually under some change or
movement; yet the identity designated by its name is still maintained,<a name="FnAnchor16_21" href="#Footnote16_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
 and many true predications respecting it remain true in spite of its
partial change. The argument in defence of the Maxim of Contradiction
is, that it is a postulate implied in all the particular statements as
to matters of daily experience, that a man understands and acts upon
when heard from his neighbours; a postulate such that, if you deny it,
no speech is either significant or trustworthy to inform and guide those
 who hear it. If the speaker both affirms and denies the same fact at
once, no information is conveyed, nor can the hearer act upon the words.
 Thus, in the Acharnenses of Aristophanes, Dikæopolis knocks at the door
 of Euripides, and inquires whether the poet is within; Kephisophon, the
 attendant, answers — “Euripides is within and not within.” This answer
is unintelligible; Dikæopolis cannot act upon it; until Kephisophon
explains that “not within” is intended metaphorically. Then, again, all
the actions in detail of a man’s life are founded upon his own belief of
 some facts and disbelief of other facts: he goes to Megara, believing
that the person whom he desires to see is at Megara, and at the same
time disbelieving the contrary: he acts upon his belief both as to what
is good and what is not good, in the way of pursuit and avoidance. You
may cite innumerable examples both of speech and action in the detail of
 life, which the Herakleitean must go through like other persons; and
when, if he proceeded upon his own theory, he could neither give nor
receive information by speech, nor ground any action upon the beliefs
which he declares to co-exist in his own mind. Accordingly, the
Herakleitean Kratylus (so Aristotle says) renounced the use of
affirmative speech, and simply pointed with his finger.<a name="FnAnchor16_22" href="#Footnote16_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id="page581"></a>581</span>The
Maxim of Contradiction is thus seen to be only the general expression of
 a postulate implied in all such particular speeches as communicate real
 information. It is proved by a very copious and diversified Induction,
from matters of experience familiar to every individual person. It is
not less true in regard to propositions affirming changes, motions, or
events, than in regard to those declaring durable states or attributes.</p>
<p>
In the long pleading of Aristotle on behalf of the Maxim of
Contradiction against the Herakleiteans, the portion of it that appeals
to Induction is the really forcible portion; conforming as it does to
what he had laid down in the Analytica Posteriora about the inductive
origin of the <i>principia</i> of demonstration. He employs, however,
besides, several other dialectical arguments built more or less upon
theories of his own, and therefore not likely to weigh much with an
Herakleitean theorist; who — arguing, as he did argue, that (because
neither subject nor predicate was ever unchanged or stable for two
moments together) no true proposition could be framed but was at the
same time false, and that contraries were in perpetual co-existence —
could not by any general reasoning be involved in greater contradiction
and inconsistency than he at once openly proclaimed.<a name="FnAnchor16_23" href="#Footnote16_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
 It can only be shown that such a doctrine cannot be reconciled with the
 necessities of daily speech, as practised by himself, as well as by
others. We read, indeed, one ingenious argument whereby Aristotle adopts
 this belief in the co-existence of contraries, but explains it in a
manner of his own, through his much employed distinction between
potential and actual existence. Two contraries cannot co-exist (he says)
 in actuality; but they both may and do co-exist in different senses —
one or both of them being potential. This, however, is a theory totally
different from that of Herakleitus; coincident only in words and in
seeming. It does indeed eliminate the contradiction; but that very
contradiction formed the characteristic feature and keystone of the
Herakleitean theory. The case against this last theory is, that it is at
 variance with psychological facts, by incorrectly assuming the
co-existence of contradictory beliefs in the mind; and that it conflicts
 both with postulates implied in the daily colloquy of detail between
man and man, and with the volitional preferences that determine
individual action. All of these are founded on a belief in the regular
sequence of our sensations, and in the at least temporary durability of
combined potential aggregates of sensations, which we enunciate in the
language of definite attributes belonging to definite substances. This
language, the common medium of communication among non-theorizing men,
is accepted as a basis, and is generalized and regularized, in the
logical theories of Aristotle.</p>

He here,
indeed, applies this observation immediately to the Protagoreans,
against whom it does not tell, instead of the Herakleiteans, against
whom it does tell. The whole of the reasoning in this part of the
Metaphysica is directed indiscriminately, and in the same words, against
 Protagoreans and Herakleiteans.</p></div>
<p>
The doctrine here mentioned is vindicated by Aristotle, not only against
 Herakleitus, by asserting the Maxim of Contradiction, but also against
Anaxagoras, by asserting the Maxim of Excluded Middle. Here we have the
second <i>principium</i> of Demonstration, which, if it required to be
defended at all, can only be defended (like the first) by a process of
Induction. Aristotle adduces several arguments in support of it, some of
 which involve an appeal to Induction, though not broadly or openly
avowed; but others of them assume what adversaries, and Anaxagoras
especially, were not likely to grant. We must remember that both
Anaxagoras and Herakleitus propounded their theories as portions of
Physical Philosophy or of Ontology; and that in their time no such
logical principles and distinctions as those that Aristotle lays down in
 the Organon, had yet been made known or pressed upon their attention.
Now, Aristotle, while professing to defend these Axioms as data of
Ontology, forgets that they deal with the logical aspect of Ontology, as
 formulated in methodical propositions. His view of the Axioms cannot be
 properly appreciated without a classification of propositions, such as
neither Herakleitus nor Anaxagoras found existing or originated for
themselves. Aristotle has taught us what Herakleitus and Anaxagoras had
not been taught — to distinguish separate propositions as universal,
particular and singular; and to distinguish pairs of propositions as
contrary, sub-contrary, and contradictory. To take the simplest case,
that of a singular proposition, in regard to which the distinction
between contrary and contradictory has no application, — such as the
answer (cited above) of Kephisophon about Euripides. Here Aristotle
would justly contend that the two propositions — Euripides is within,
Euripides is not within — could not be either both of them true, or both
 of them false; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582"></a>582</span>that
 is, that we could neither believe both, nor disbelieve both. If
Kephisophon had answered, Euripides is neither within nor not within,
Dikæopolis would have found himself as much at a loss with the two
negatives as he was with the two affirmatives. In regard to singular
propositions, neither the doctrine of Herakleitus (to believe both
affirmation and negation) nor that of Anaxagoras (to disbelieve both) is
 admissible. But, when in place of singular propositions we take either
universal or particular propositions, the rule to follow is no longer so
 simple and peremptory. The universal affirmative and the universal
negative are <i>contrary</i>; the particular affirmative and the particular negative are <i>sub-contrary</i>; the universal affirmative and the particular negative, or the universal negative and the particular affirmative, are <i>contradictory</i>.
 It is now noted in all manuals of Logic, that of two contrary
propositions, both cannot be true, but both may be false; that of two
sub-contraries, both may be true, but both cannot be false; and that of
two contradictories, one must be true and the other false.</p>

 — dealing with Unity and Opposites — though it also has no place in the

<h2><span class="smcap">Book &#915;.</span></h2>
<p>
In this First Philosophy, Aristotle analyses and illustrates the meaning of the <i>generalissima</i>
 of language — the most general and abstract words which language
includes. All these are words in common and frequent use; in the process
 of framing or putting together language, they have become permanently
stamped and circulated as the result of many previous comparisons, gone
through but afterwards forgotten, or perhaps gone through at first
without any distinct consciousness. Men employ these words familiarly in
 ordinary speech, and are understood by others when they do so. For the
most part, they employ the words correctly and consistently, in the
affirmation of particular propositions relating to topics of daily life
and experience. But this is not always or uniformly the case. Sometimes,
 more or less often, men fall into error and inconsistency in the
employment of these familiar general terms. The First Philosophy takes
up the generalities and established phrases in this condition; following
 back analytically the synthetical process which the framers of language
 have pursued without knowing or at least without recording it, and
bringing under conscious attention the different meanings, more or
fewer, in which these general words are used.</p>
<p>
Philosophia Prima devotes itself, specially and in the first instance, to Ens <i>quatenus</i>
 Ens in all its bearings; being thus distinguished from mathematics and
other particular sciences, each of which devotes itself to a separate
branch of Ens (p. 1003, a. 25). It searches into the First Causes or
Elements of Ens <i>per se</i>, not <i>per accidens</i> (a. 31). But Ens
is a commune, not generically, but analogically; constituted by common
relationship to one and the same terminus, as everything healthy is
related to health. The Principle (&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;) of all Entia is Essence (&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;);
 but some Entia are so called as being affections of Essence; others, as
 being a transition to Essence, or as destruction, privation, quality,
efficient or generative cause, of Essence or its <i>analoga</i>; others, again, as being negations (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;) thereof, whence, for example, we say that Non-Ens <i>is</i>
 Non-Ens (b. 6-10). There is one science of all these primary,
secondary, tertiary, &amp;c., Entia; just as there is one science of all
 things healthy, of the primary, the secondary, the tertiary, &amp;c., <i>quatenus</i>
 healthy. But, in all such matters, that science bears in the first
instance and specially (&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#962;) on the Primum Aliquid, from which all
the secondary and other derivatives take their departure, and upon which
 they depend (b. 16). Accordingly, in the present case, since Essence is
 the Primum Aliquid, the province of First Philosophy is to investigate
the causes and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id="page584"></a>584</span>principles
 of Essences in all their varieties (b. 18-22). Now whatever varieties
there are of Ens, the like varieties there are of Unum; for the two are
always implicated together, though the words are not absolutely the same
 in meaning (b. 24-35). Accordingly both Ens and Unum with all the
varieties of each belong to Philosophia Prima; likewise Idem, Simile,
&amp;c., and the opposites thereof. All opposites may be traced in the
last analysis to this foundation — the antithesis of Unum and Multa (p.
1004, a. 1). We must set forth and discriminate the different varieties —
 primary, secondary, tertiary, &amp;c. — of Idem and Simile, and also of
 their opposites, Diversum and Dissimile; and we must show how they are
derived from or related to Primum Idem, &amp;c., just as we must do in
the case of Ens and Unum. All this task belongs to First Philosophy (a.
20-30). Aristotle speaks of &#8001; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#962;, as meaning the master of
Philosophia Prima (b. 1; <span class="correction" title="amended from regular capital letter B"><span class="smcap">B.</span></span> p. 997, a. 14). </p>
<p>
If these investigations do not belong to the First Philosopher, to which
 among the other investigators can they belong? Who is to enquire
whether Sokrates, and Sokrates sitting, is the same person? Whether Unum
 is opposite to Unum? In how many senses Opposite can be said? (p. 1004,
 b. 3). All these are affections <i>per se</i> of Unum <i>quatenus</i> Unum, and of Ens <i>quatenus</i> Ens, not <i>quatenus</i> numbers, or lines, or fire; that is, they are propria (<i>sensu logico</i>)
 of Ens and Unum (not included in the notion or definition, but
deducible therefrom — “notæ consecutione notionis”), just as odd and
even, proportionality, equality, excess and defect, are propria of
numbers; and there are other propria of solids, whether moved or
unmoved, heavy or light. It is these propria of Ens and Unum that
Philosophia Prima undertakes to explain (b. 7-16), and which others fail
 to explain, because they take no account of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; (b. 10), or of the
fundamental Ens or Essentia to which these belong as propria.</p>
<p>
These Propria of Ens are the &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#945; — the special and peculiar matter or
 principles — of Philosophia Prima. That all of them belong in this
special way to the First Philosopher, we may farther see by the fact
that all of them are handled by the Dialectician and the Sophist, who
assume an attitude counterfeiting the Philosopher. All three travel over
 the same ground, and deal with Ens, as a matter common to all (p. 1004,
 b. 20). But the Sophist differs from the Philosopher in his purpose,
inasmuch as he aims only at giving the false appearance of wisdom
without the reality, while the Dialectician differs from the Philosopher
 in his manner of handling (&#964;&#8183; &#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#8179; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#962; — b. 24). The
Dialectician discusses the subject in a tentative way, from many
different points of view, suggested by current opinions; the Philosopher
 marches by a straight and assured road from the appropriate principles
of his science to certain conclusions and cognitions.</p>
<p>
The same view of the scope and extent of Philosophia Prima may be made
out in another way. Almost all philosophers affirm that Entia are
composed of contraries, and may be traced back to opposite principles —
odd and even, hot and cold, limit and the unlimited, friendship and
enmity, &amp;c. Now these and all other contraries may be traced back to
 Unum and Multa: this we may assume (p. 1005, a. 1; according to
Alexander Aph., it had been shown in the treatise De Bono — Schol. p.
648, a. 38, Br.). </p>
<p>
Though it be true, therefore, that neither Ens nor Unum is a true genus,
 nor separable, but both of them aggregates of analogical derivatives,
yet since all these derivatives have their root in one and the same
fundamentum, the study of all of them belongs to one and the same
science (p. 1005, a. 6-11). It is not the province of the geometer to
examine what is The Opposite, The Perfect, Ens, Unum, Idem, Diversum,
except in their application to his own problems. The general enquiry
devolves upon the First Philosopher; who will investigate Ens <i>quatenus</i> Ens, together with the belongings or appendages (&#964;&#8048; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;) of Ens <i>quatenus</i> Ens, including Prius, Posterius, Genus, Species, Totum, Pars, and such like (a. 11-18).</p>
<p>
It falls to the First Philosopher also to investigate and explain what
mathematicians call their Axioms: the mathematician ought not to do this
 himself, but to leave it to the First Philosopher. These Axioms are, in
 their highest generality, affirmations respecting Ens <i>quatenus</i>
Ens, all of which belong to the First Philosopher; from whom the
mathematician accepts them, and applies them as far as his own
department requires (p. 1005, a. 20, seq.).</p>
<p>
In First Philosophy, the firmest, best known, and most unquestionable of
 all principles is this: It is impossible for the same predicate at the
same time and in the same sense to belong and not to belong to the same
subject (p. 1005, b. 20). No one can at the same time believe that the
same thing both is and is not; though Herakleitus professed to believe
this, we must not suppose that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page585" id="page585"></a>585</span>he
 really did believe it (b. 25). No man can hold two contrary opinions at
 the same time (b. 31). This is by nature the first principle of all
other axioms; to which principle all demonstrations are in the last
resort brought back (b. 33: &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#958;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;
&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;). </p>
<p>
Aristotle then proceeds to explain and vindicate at length this &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942; —
the Principle of Contradiction, which many at that time denied. This
principle is at once the most knowable, and noway assumed as hypothesis
(&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#969;&#964;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957; — p. 1005, b. 13). You cannot indeed
demonstrate it to be true; the very attempt to demonstrate it would be
unphilosophical: demonstration of every thing, is an impossibility. You
cannot march upwards in an infinite progression of demonstrations; you
must arrive ultimately at some first truth which is not demonstrable;
and, if any such first truth is to be recognized, no one can point out
any truth better entitled to such privilege than the Principle of
Contradiction (p. 1006, a. 11). But you can convict an opponent of
self-contradiction (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#958;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;, a. 12, 15), if he will only
consent to affirm any proposition in significant terms — that is, in
terms which he admits to be significant to himself and which he intends
as such to others; in other words, if he will enter into dialogue with
you, for without significant speech there can be no dialogue with him at
 all (a. 21).</p>
<p>
When the opponent has shown his willingness to comply with the
conditions of dialogue, by advancing a proposition in terms each having
one definite signification, it is plain, by his own admission, that the
proposition does not both signify and not signify the same. First, the
copula of the proposition (<i>est</i>) does not signify what would be signified if the copula were <i>non est</i>;
 so that here is one case wherein the affirmative and the negative
cannot be both of them true (p. 1006, a. 30; see Alex. Schol. and
Bonitz’s note). Next, let the subject of the proposition be <i>homo</i>;
 a term having only one single definite signification, or perhaps having
 two or three (or any definite number of) distinct significations, each
definite. If the number of distinct significations be indefinite, the
term is unfit for the purpose of dialogue (a. 30-b. 10). The term <i>homo</i> will signify one thing only; it will have one determinate essence and definition — say <i>animal bipes</i>: that is, if any thing be a man, the same will be <i>animal bipes</i>. But this last cannot be the essence and definition of <i>non-homo</i> also: <i>non-homo</i>, as a different name, must have different definition; <i>homo</i> and <i>non-homo</i> cannot be like &#955;&#974;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#957; and &#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;, two terms having the same signification, essence and definition; for <i>homo</i>
 signifies one subject of constant and defined nature, not simply one
among many predicates applicable by accident to this same constant
subject; it signifies &#956;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; and not &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; (Scholia, p.
656, b. 21). Since each name indeed is applied by convention to what it
denominates, the name <i>non-homo</i> may be applied elsewhere to that which we term <i>homo</i>; but this is a mere difference of naming; what bears the name <i>homo</i>, and what bears the name <i>non-homo</i>, must always be different, if <i>homo</i> is defined to signify one determinate nature (b. 22). The one single nature and essence defined as belonging to <i>homo</i>, cannot be the same as that belonging to <i>non-homo</i>. If any thing be <i>homo</i>, the same cannot be <i>non-homo</i>: if any thing be <i>non-homo</i>, the same cannot be <i>homo</i> (b. 25-34). Whoever says that <i>homo</i> and <i>non-homo</i> have the same meaning, must say <i>à fortiori</i> that <i>homo</i>, <i>fortis</i>, <i>musicus</i>, <i>simus</i>, <i>pulcher</i>, &amp;c., have the same meaning; for not one of these terms is so directly and emphatically opposite to <i>homo</i>, as <i>non-homo</i>
 is. He must therefore admit that the meaning, not merely of all these
words but also, of a host besides is the same; in other words, that not
merely Opposites are one, but all other things besides, under different
names (&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7955;&#957; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; — p. 1007, a. 6). </p>
<p>
This argument is directed against those who maintain that affirmative
and negative are both true at once, but who still desire to keep up
dialogue (Alex. Schol. p. 658, a. 26, Br.: &#964;&#8183; &#964;&#942;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;
&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#974;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179; &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;). No man who
maintains this opinion, can keep his consistency in dialogue, if he will
 only give direct answers to the questions put to him, without annexing
provisoes and gratuitous additions to his answers. If you ask him,
Whether it is true that Sokrates is <i>homo</i>? he ought to answer plainly Yes, or No. He ought not to answer: “Yes, but Sokrates is also <i>non-homo</i>,”
 meaning that Sokrates is also the subject of many other accidental
predicates — fair, flat-nosed, brave, accomplished, &amp;c. He ought to
answer simply to the question, whether the one essence or definition
signified by the word man, belongs to Sokrates or not; he ought not to
introduce the mention of these accidental predicates, to which the
question did not refer. These accidental predicates are infinite in
number; he cannot enumerate them all, and therefore he ought not to
introduce the mention of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page586" id="page586"></a>586</span>any of them. Sokrates is <i>homo</i>, by the essence and definition of the word; he is <i>non-homo</i>,
 ten thousand times over, by accidental predicates; that is, he is fair,
 brave, musical, flat-nosed, &amp;c., all of which are varieties of the
general word <i>non-homo</i> (p. 1007, a. 7-19).</p>
<p>
Those who contend that both members of the Antiphasis are at once true
disallow Essentia altogether, and the distinction between it and
Accidens (p. 1007, a. 21). When we say that the word <i>homo</i> signifies a certain Essentia, we mean that its Essentia is nothing different from this, and that the being <i>homo</i> cannot be the same as the being <i>non-homo</i>, or the not being <i>homo</i>.
 Those against whom we are reasoning discard Essentia as distinguished
from Accidens, and consider all predicates as Accidentia. <i>Albus</i> belongs to <i>homo</i> as an accident; but the essence of <i>albus</i> does not coincide with that of <i>homo</i>, and cannot be predicated of <i>homo</i>
 (a. 32). Upon the theory of these opponents, there would be no Prima
Essentia to which all accidents are attached; but this theory is
untenable. Accidents cannot be attached one to another in an infinite
ascending series (b. 1). You cannot proceed more than two steps upward:
first one accident, then a second; the two being joined by belonging to
one and the same subject. No accident can be the accident of another
accident. &#932;&#8056; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#957; may have the accident &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, or &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957; may
have the accident &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#957;; each of these may be called indifferently the
accident of the other; but the truth is, that &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#962; and &#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; are
both of them accidents belonging to the common Essentia — <i>homo</i>. But, when we affirm <i>homo est musicus</i>, we implicate the accident with the Essentia to which it belongs; that Essentia is signified by the subject <i>homo</i>.
 There must thus be one word which has signification as Essentia; and,
when such is the case, we have already shown that both members of the
Antiphasis cannot be predicated at once (b. 5-18).</p>
<p>
(Alexander, in Scholia, p. 658, b. 40-p. 659, b. 14, Br., remarks on
this argument of Aristotle: Those who held the opinion here controverted
 by Aristotle — &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957; — had in their minds
accidental propositions, in regard to which they were right, except that
 both members of the Antiphasis cannot be true at the same time. <i>Sokrates est musicus</i> — <i>Sokrates non est musicus</i>:
 these two propositions are both true, in the sense that one or other of
 them is true only potentially, and that both cannot be actually true at
 the same time. One of them is true, and the other false, at the present
 moment; but that which is now false has been true in the past, and may
become true in the future. Aristotle does not controvert this theory so
far as regards accidental propositions; but he maintains that it is
untenable about essential propositions, and that the theorists
overlooked this distinction.)</p>
<p>
Moreover, if you say that both members of the Antiphasis are alike true
respecting every predicate of a given subject, you must admit that all
things are one (p. 1007, b. 20). The same thing will be at once a wall, a
 trireme, a man. Respecting every subject, you may always either affirm
or deny any given predicate; but, according to this theory, whenever it
is true to affirm, it is always equally true to deny. If you can say
truly, <i>Homo non est triremis</i>, you may say with equal truth, according to the theory before us, <i>Homo est triremis</i>. And, of course, <i>Homo non est triremis</i> may be said truly; since (still according to this theory) the much more special negative, <i>Homo non est homo</i>, may be said truly (b. 32).</p>
<p>
Again, if this theory be admitted, the doctrine that every predicate may
 be either affirmed or denied of any given subject, will no longer hold
true. For, if it be true to say of Sokrates both <i>Est homo</i> and <i>Est non-homo</i>: it must also be true to say of him both <i>Non est homo</i> and <i>Non est non-homo</i>.
 If both affirmative and negative may be alike affirmed, both may be
alike denied (p. 1008, a. 2-7). If both members of the Antiphasis are
alike true, both must be alike false (Alex. Schol. p. 663, a. 14-34).</p>
<p>
Again, the theory that both members of the Antiphasis are alike true, is
 intended by its authors to apply universally or not universally. Every
thing is both white and not white, Ens and Non-Ens; or this is true with
 some propositions, but not with regard to others. If the theorists take
 the latter ground and allow some exceptions, so far at least as those
exceptions reach, firm truth is left (&#945;&#8023;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#949;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953; — p.
1008, a. 11). But, if they take the former ground and allow no
exceptions, they may still perhaps say: Wherever you can affirm with
truth, we can also deny with truth; but, wherever we can deny with
truth, we cannot in every case affirm with truth (a. 15). Meeting them
upon this last ground, we remark that at any rate some negative
propositions are here admitted to be knowable, and we obtain thus much
of settled opinion; besides, wherever the negative is knowable, the
corresponding affirmative must be still more knowable (a. 18). If they
take the former ground <span class="pagenum"><a name="page587" id="page587"></a>587</span>and
 say that, wherever the negative is true, the affirmative is true also,
they must either mean that each of them is true separately, or that
neither of them is true separately but that both are true when
enunciated together in a couple (a. 19). If they mean the latter, they
do not talk either of these things or of any thing else: there is
neither speech nor speaker, nothing but non-entity; and how can
non-entity either speak or walk (a. 22)? Every thing would be confounded
 in one. If they mean the former — that affirmative and negative are
each alike true taken separately, we reply that, since this must be true
 as much respecting one subject as respecting another, so there can be
no distinction or difference between one subject and another; all must
be alike and the same; if there be any difference of any kind, this must
 constitute a special and exceptional matter, standing apart from the
theory now under discussion. Upon this view of the theory in question,
then, as well as upon the preceding, we are landed in the same result:
all things would be confounded into one (a. 27). All men would speak
truly and all men alike (including the theorist himself, by his own
admission) would speak falsely. Indeed in discussing with this theorist
we have nothing to talk about; for he says nothing. He does not say, It
is thus; he does not say, It is not thus; he says, It is both thus and
not thus: then, again, he negatives both, saying, It is neither thus nor
 not thus; so that there is nothing definite in what he says (a. 32).</p>
<p>
Again, let us ask, Does he who believes things to be so, believe
falsely, and he who believes things not to be so and so, believe falsely
 also, while he who believes both at once, believes truly? If this last
person believes truly, what is meant by the common saying that such and
such is the constitution of nature? If you even say that the last person
 does not indeed believe truly, but believes more truly than he who
believes the affirmative alone, or he who believes the negative alone,
we still have something definite in the constitution of nature,
something which is really true, and not true and false at the same time.
 But, if there be no more truly or less truly — if all persons alike and
 equally speak truly and speak falsely — speech is useless to such
persons; what they say, they at the same time unsay. If the state of
their minds really corresponds to this description — if they believe
nothing, but at once think so and so and do not think so and so — how do
 such persons differ from plants (b. 3-12; see Alexander’s Scholion, p.
665, b. 9-17 Br., about the explanation of &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;, and the distinction
between &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957; and &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;, p. 665, b. 31, seq.)?</p>
<p>
It is certain, however, that these theorists are not like plants, and do
 not act as such in matters of ordinary life. They look for water, when
thirsty; they keep clear of falling into a well or over a precipice. In
regard to what is desirable or undesirable, at least, they do not really
 act upon their own theory — That both members of the Antiphasis are
equally true and equally false. They act upon the contrary theory — That
 one of the members is true, and the other false. But, if these
theorists, admitting that they act thus, say that they do not act thus
with any profession of knowing the truth, but simply on the faith of
appearance and greater probability, we reply that this ought to impose
upon them a stronger sense of duty in regard to getting at the truth.
The state of Opinion stands to that of Knowledge in the same relation as
 that of sickness to health (p. 1008, b. 12-31).</p>
<p>
Finally, to follow up this last argument, even if we grant to these
theorists that both members of the Antiphasis are true, still there are
degrees of truth: the More and the Less pervades the constitution of
nature (p. 1008, b. 32). We shall not surely affirm that two and three
are equally even; nor shall we say, when any one affirms four to be
five, that he commits an equal error with one who affirms four to be a
thousand. Clearly one of these persons is more near to the truth, the
other is less near to the truth. But, if there be such a thing as <i>being nearer to the truth</i>,
 there must surely be some truth to which you have come nearer; and,
even if this be denied, yet at least what we have already obtained (the
&#7952;&#947;&#947;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;) is something firmer and of a more truth-like
character. We shall thus have got rid of that unqualified theory which
forbids all definite conceptions of the intellect (&#954;&#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7984; &#956;&#942; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’
 &#7972;&#948;&#951; &#947;&#941; &#964;&#953; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#946;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;
 &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#969;&#955;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#8135; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#8115; &#8001;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#953; — p. 1009, a.
2).</p>
<p>
Having thus completed his refutation of the “unqualified theory,” which
declares both members of the Antiphasis to be alike true, Aristotle
passes to the examination of the Protagorean doctrine “Homo Mensura:” he
 affirms that it proceeds from the same mode of thinking, and that the
two must stand or fall together. For, if all things which appear true
are true, all things must be at once true and false; since the
opposition of men’s opinions is a notorious fact, each <span class="pagenum"><a name="page588" id="page588"></a>588</span>man thinking his own opinions true and his opponent’s opinions false (p. 1009, a. 16).</p>
<p>
Aristotle here distinguishes between two classes of reasoners, both of
whom he combats, but who require to be dealt with in a very different
manner: (1) Those who are sincerely convinced of what they affirm; (2)
Those who have no sincere conviction, but merely take up the thesis as a
 matter for ingenious argument (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#957;), and will not relinquish it
 until they are compelled by a strong case made out against them. The
first require persuasion, for their ignorance may be easily cured, and
the difficulties whereby they are puzzled may be removed; the second
require to be constrained by a forcible Elenchus or refutation, which
may correct their misuse of dialectic and language (p. 1009, a. 22).</p>
<p>
Aristotle begins with the first class. The difficulties which perplex
them proceed from sensible things (&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957; — p. 1009, a. 23).
They perceive contrary things generated by the same; and this leads them
 to believe that contraries are both alike real, and that the two
members of the Antiphasis are alike true. For, since Non-Ens cannot be
generated, both the two contraries must have pre-existed together as
Entia, prior to the generation in the thing as it then stood (a. 25).
This is the opinion of Anaxagoras, who affirms that every thing is mixed
 in every thing; and of Demokritus, who affirms that Plenum and Inane —
in other words. Ens and Non-Ens — exist alike and together in every part
 (a. 28). To these reasoners we reply, that in a certain sense they are
right, in a certain sense wrong. The term Ens is used in two senses: the
 same thing may therefore be at once Ens and Non-Ens, but not in the
same sense; moreover, from Non-Ens in one sense something may be
generated, but not from Non-Ens in the other. The same thing may be at
once two opposites <i>in power</i>, but not <i>in act</i> (&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#956;&#8050;&#957;
&#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7941;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;, &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#8115; &#948;’ &#959;&#8020; — a. 35). We
must farther remind these reasoners that the basis on which they proceed
 is not universally admissible; for there are various Entia of
completely distinct and different essence, in which there is neither
movement nor generation nor destruction of any sort (a. 38).</p>
<p>
The doctrine held by Protagoras — That what appears true is truth, comes
 from the same source as the other doctrine — That both members of the
Antiphasis are true. Both doctrines proceed from the sensible world
(&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#7936;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#7952;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#7952;&#955;&#942;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#957; — p. 1009, b. 2; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962; refers back to a. 23 — &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7969; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;, the
 other doctrine). Demokritus, Protagoras, and others observe that
sensible phenomena are differently appreciated by different men, by
other animals, and even by the same animal or man at different times.
They do not think that truth upon these points of difference can be
determined by a majority of voices. Demokritus says that either there is
 nothing true, or that we cannot know what it is (b. 10). These
reasoners identified intelligence with sensible perception, and
considered that this latter implied a change in the subject (b. 13):
they conceived that what appeared to sense was necessarily true.
Empedokles, Demokritus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Homer, &amp;c., all lay
down the doctrine, that the intelligence of men is varied with and
determined by their sensible perceptions. They thought that men of wrong
 intelligence were nevertheless intelligent men, though their
intelligence did not carry them to the same conclusions (b. 30); that
if, both in one case and in the other, there were acts of intelligence,
there must be realities corresponding to both, justifying the
affirmative as well as the negative (b. 33).</p>
<p>
That sincere and diligent enquirers should fall into these errors is
very discouraging; but we must remark that their errors originated from
this — that, while investigating the truth respecting Entia, they
supposed that Entia were only the Percepta or Percipibilia (p. 1010, a.
2). Now in these Entia Perceptionis there is a great deal of the
Indefinite and of mere Potential Entity (a. 3). Hence the theories of
these reasoners were plausible, though not true. They saw that all the
Entia Perceptionis were in perpetual movement, and they thought it
impossible to predicate any thing with truth respecting what was at all
times and in every way changing (a. 9). Kratylus and the Herakleitizers
pushed this to an extreme. Even against their reasoning, we have
something to say in reply. We grant that they have some ground for
imagining that what undergoes change does not exist at the moment when
it changes (a. 16). Yet even here there is room for dispute; for that
which is in the act of casting off, still retains something of that
which is being cast off; and of that which is being generated, something
 must already be in existence. As a general doctrine, if something is in
 course of being destroyed, something must be in existence; and, if
something is in course of being generated, there must exist something
out of which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id="page589"></a>589</span>it proceeds and by which it is being generated; nor can this go back <i>ad infinitum</i>
 (a. 22). Dropping this argument, however, let us advance another.
Change as to Quantity is not the same as change as to Quality or Form.
Let us grant that, as to Quantity, there is change continuous and
perpetual — growth or decay — no such thing as stationary condition. But
 all our knowledge relates to Quality or Form, in which there is no
continuous change (a. 24: &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;, &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#969; &#956;&#8052; &#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957;· &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;. — Compare Alex. Schol., p. 671, b.
5-22; p. 670, a. 36: Bonitz has good remarks in his note, pp. 202-204<span class="correction" title="stop omitted">.</span>). </p>
<p>
Again, we have a farther reproach to make to these reasoners. Their
argument is based only on the Percepta or Percipienda; yet, even as to
these it is true only as to the minority and untrue as to the majority.
It is true merely as far as the sublunary Percepta; but as to the
superlunary or celestial it is the reverse of truth. Our earth and its
neighbourhood is indeed in continual generation and destruction; but
this is an insignificant part of the whole. In affirming any thing
respecting the whole, we ought to follow the majority rather than the
minority (p. 1010, a. 28-31<span class="correction" title="amended from '.)'">).</span> </p>
<p>
Lastly, we must repeat against these reasoners the argument urged just
now. We must explain to them, that there exists, apart from and besides
all generation, destruction, change, motion, &amp;c., a certain
Immovable Nature (&#7936;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; — a. 34). Indeed their own doctrine
 — That all things both are and are not — would seem to imply an
universal stationary condition rather than universal change (a. 38).
There can be no change; for there is no prospective terminus which can
be reached by change. Every thing is assumed as already existing.</p>
<p>
We have now to remark upon the special doctrine of Protagoras — &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#964;&#8056;
&#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962;. If we grant that perception is always true upon
matters strictly belonging to it, still phantasy is not identical with
perception and we cannot say that what appears to the phantasy is always
 true (&#964;&#8056; &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; — which implies a reference to &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945; — p. 1010,
b. 2), Besides, it is strange that thinkers should puzzle themselves
about the questions: Whether the magnitude and colour of objects is that
 which appears to a spectator near or to a spectator far off? and to a
spectator healthy or jaundiced? Whether the weight of an object is as it
 appears to a weak or to a strong man? Whether objects are truly what
they appear to men awake or to men asleep? Their own actions show that
they do not think there is any doubt; for if, being in Libya, they
happen to dream that they are in Athens, none of them ever think of
going to the Odeium (b. 5-11). Moreover, respecting the future, as Plato
 remarks, the anticipations of the ignorant man are not so trustworthy
as those of the physician, whether a patient will recover or not (b.
14). Then, again, in respect of present sensations, the perception of
sight is not equally trustworthy with the perception of smell about a
question of odour (b. 17); and the perception of smell will never report
 at the same time and about the same thing, that it is at once fragrant
and not fragrant; nor, indeed, at different times about the affection
itself, but only about the subject to which the affection belonged (b.
20). The same wine which tasted sweet last month, may now taste not
sweet; but the sweet taste itself is the same now and last month, and
the reports of the sense are never contradictory on this point. The
sweet taste which is to come in the future will be of necessity like the
 sweet taste in the past. Now such necessity is abrogated by all those
reasonings which affirm at once the two members of the Antiphasis. These
 reasonings disallow all essence of every thing, and all necessity; for
whatever is necessary, cannot be at once both thus and not thus (b.
21-30).</p>

On the whole, if nothing exist except Percepta, nothing can exist
without animated beings; since without these last there can be no
perception. It is indeed true, perhaps, that under such a supposition
there exist neither Percepta nor acts of Perception (which are
affections of the Percipient); but that the Substrata which cause
Perception should not exist even without Perception — is an
impossibility (p. 1010, b. 33: &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8048; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#956;&#8052; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, &#7939; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150; &#964;&#8052;&#957;
 &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, &#7936;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;). Perception is not perception
of itself; there exists besides, apart from perception, something else
which must necessarily be prior to perception. For the Movens is by
nature prior to the Motum; and this is not the less true, though each of
 these two is enunciated in relation to the other (b. 35).</p>

A difficulty is often started, and enquiry made, Who is to be the judge
of health and sickness? Whom are we to recognize as the person to judge
rightly in each particular case? Persons might as well raise difficulty
and make enquiry, Whether we are now awake or asleep? It is plain by
men’s actual conduct that they have no real doubt upon the point in any
particular case; and both these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id="page590"></a>590</span>enquiries
 arise from the same fundamental mistake — that men require to have
every thing demonstrated, and will recognize nothing without
demonstration. (Alex. says in Scholia, p. 675, b. 3: &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7939; &#7952;&#954;

&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#953;.) Those who sincerely and seriously feel this difficulty, may be
 expected to acquiesce in the explanation here given (p. 1011, a. 2-14).
 But those who put forward the difficulty merely for the sake of
argument, must be informed that they require an impossibility. They
require to have a refutative case made out against them (which can only
be done by reducing them to a &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;); yet they
themselves begin by refusing to acknowledge this refutation as
sufficient, for they maintain the thesis — That both members of the
Antiphasis are alike and equally true (a. 16; compare Alex. Schol., p.
675, b. 20-28).</p>
<p>
Those who maintain this last-mentioned thesis say, in other words, That
every thing which appears true, is true. But this thesis of theirs
cannot be defended except by the admission that every thing is relative,
 and that nothing is absolute. Accordingly they must take care to
announce their thesis, not in absolute terms as it now stands, but in
terms strictly relative: Every thing which appears true, appears true to
 some individual — at a certain moment of time — under certain
circumstances and conditions (p. 1011, a. 24). For, if they affirm, in
absolute phrase, that all things are alike false and true, on the ground
 that what appears true is true, urging that the same things do not
appear true either to different persons, or to the same person at
different times — nay, sometimes even to the same person at the same
time, as may be seen by handling a pebble between two crossed fingers
(&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#973;&#955;&#969;&#957; — a. 33), so that it appears two to the
touch, but only one to the sight; — we shall reply, that there is no
such contradiction of judgment, if they confine themselves to the same
person, the same time, and one and the same sense. In these cases, there
 is only one affirmation which appears to be true, and therefore,
according to their theory, that affirmation is true. They are not,
therefore, justified in concluding that every thing is alike true and
false (b. 1).</p>
<p>
They can only escape this refutation by avoiding to say, This is true,
and by saying, This is true to such an individual, at such a time,
&amp;c.; that is, by making every affirmation relative to some person’s
opinion or perception. Hence the inference is, that nothing either ever
has occurred or ever will occur, without the antecedent opinion of some
person (&#956;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; — p. 1011, b. 6): if any thing ever has so
 occurred, it cannot be true that all things are relative to opinion.
Moreover, if the Relatum be one, it must be relative to some one, some
definite, Correlate; and, even if the same Relatum be both half and
equal, it will not be equal in reference to a double Correlate, but half
 in reference to a double, and equal in reference to an equal (b. 9).
Moreover, if <i>homo</i> and <i>conceptum</i> have both of them no more than a relative existence — that is, if both of them exist only in correlation with a <i>concipiens</i> — then the <i>concipiens</i> cannot be <i>homo</i>; it will be the <i>conceptum</i> that is <i>homo</i>. And, if every individual thing have existence only in relation to a <i>concipiens</i>, this <i>concipiens</i>
 must form the Correlate to an infinite number of Relata (b. 12). (All
this is very briefly and obscurely stated in Aristotle. The commentary
of Alexander is copious and valuable: one might suppose that he had
before him a more ample text; for it is difficult to find in the present
 text all that his commentary states<span class="correction" title="amended from ').'">.)</span> </p>
<p>
Let thus much be said to establish the opinion, That the two members of
the Antiphasis (the Affirmative and the Negative) are not both true at
the same time. We have shown whence it arises that some persons suppose
both to be true; and what are the consequences in which those who hold
this opinion entangle themselves. Accordingly, since both sides of the
Antiphasis cannot be truly predicated of the same subject, it is
impossible that opposite attributes can belong at the same time to the
same subject (p. 1011, b. 17: &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#964;&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945; &#7941;&#956;&#945; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8183;
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;). For one of these opposites includes in itself privation, and
privation of a certain real essence; now privation is the negation of a
certain definite genus. And, since affirmation and negation cannot be
truly applied at the same time, it follows that opposite attributes
cannot belong at the same time to the same subject. At least it is only
possible thus far: one may belong to it absolutely, the other <i>secundum quid</i>; or both of them <i>secundum quid</i>
 only (&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#952;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957;, &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#948;&#8050;
&#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#972; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; — b. 20).</p>
<p>
But, also, there can be nothing intermediate between the two members of
the Antiphasis; we must of necessity either affirm or deny any one thing
 of any other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>591</span>(p.
 1011, b. 24). This will appear clearly, when we have first defined what
 is Truth and Falsehood. To say that Ens is not, or that Non-Ens is, is
false: To say that Ens is, or that Non-Ens is not, is true. Accordingly,
 he who predicates <i>est</i> — or he who predicates <i>non est</i> —
will speak truly or speak falsely, according as he applies his predicate
 to Ens or to Non-Ens. But he cannot, either in application to Ens or to
 Non-Ens, predicate <i>est aut non est</i> (b. 29). Such a predication
would be neither true nor false, but improper and unmeaning. (I follow
at b. 27 the text of the Berlin edition: &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#956;&#8052;
&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7970; &#968;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; — which seems to me here better than that of
Bonitz, who puts &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#956;&#8052; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7970; &#968;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; —
 following Alexander’s explanation, Schol., p. 680, a. 33, which I
cannot think to be correct, though Bonitz praises it much. Aristotle
defines Truth and Falsehood: When you say <i>Ens est</i>, or <i>Non-Ens non est</i>, you speak truth; when you say <i>Ens non est</i>, or <i>Non-Ens est</i>, you speak falsehood. Accordingly, when you employ the predicate <i>est</i>, or when you employ the predicate <i>non est</i>,
 you will speak truly or falsehood, according as the subject with which
you join it is Ens or is Non-Ens. But neither with respect to the
subject Ens nor with respect to the subject Non-Ens, can you employ the
disjunctive predicate — <i>est aut non est</i>.<span class="correction" title=") omitted">)</span></p>
<p>
Again, a medium between the two horns of the Antiphasis must be either a
 medium between opposites, like grey between white and black, or like
the neither between man and horse. If it be the latter, it will never
change; for all change is either from a negative to its affirmative (<i>non-bonum</i> to <i>bonum</i>) or <i>vice versâ</i>: now that which is both <i>non-homo</i> and <i>non-equus</i> must change, if it change at all, into that which is both <i>homo</i> and <i>equus</i>;
 but this is impossible. We see change always going on; but it is always
 change either into one of the two extremes or into the medium between
them. But can we assume that there is such a medium (so that the case
supposed will belong to the analogy of grey, halfway between white and
black)? No, we cannot assume it; for, if we granted it, we should be
forced to admit that there was change into white not proceeding from
that which is not white: now nothing of the kind is ever perceived.
There cannot therefore be any admissible medium halfway between the two
members of the Antiphasis — something which is neither white nor
not-white, neither black nor not-black (p. 1011, b. 35: &#949;&#7984; &#948;’ &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;
&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#973; — if such medium be admitted — &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#949;&#7988;&#951; &#7940;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#957;
&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#954; &#956;&#8052; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#8166; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;· &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#948;’ &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#964;&#945;&#953;). </p>
<p>
Furthermore, whatever our intelligence understands or reasons upon, it
deals with as matter affirmed or denied. The very definition of truth
and falsehood recognizes them as belonging only to affirmation or
negation: when we affirm or deny in a certain way we speak truth; when
in another way, we speak falsely. Nothing is concerned but affirmation
and denial (<i>i.e.</i>, there is no mental operation midway between the
 two — p. 1012, a. 2-5). If there be any such medium or midway process,
it is not confined to this or that particular Antiphasis, but belongs
alike to all, and must lie apart from all the different Antiphases — at
least if it is to be talked of as a reality, and not as a mere possible
combination of words; so that the speaker will neither speak truth, nor
not speak truth; which is absurd (a. 7). It must also lie apart both
from Ens and from Non-Ens; so that we should be compelled to admit a
certain mode of change of Essence, which yet shall neither be generation
 nor destruction; which is impossible. <span class="correction" title="( omitted">(</span>According to Aristotle’s definition, all change of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; must be either Generation, <i>i.e.</i>, passage from &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957; to &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;, or Destruction, <i>i.e.</i>, passage from &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957; to &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;. — See Alex. Schol. p. 681, b. 30-40<span class="correction" title="amended from ').'">.)</span> </p>
<p>
Again, there are certain genera in which negation carries with it the
affirmation of an opposite; such as odd and even, in numbers. In such
genera, if we are to admit any medium apart from and between the two
members of the Antiphasis, we should be forced to admit some number
which is neither odd nor even (p. 1012, a. 11). This is impossible: the
definition excludes it. (Alexander gives this as the definition of
number: &#960;&#8118;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#7970; &#7940;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#972;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8003;&#962; &#7970; &#7940;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7970; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> — Schol. p. 682, a. 16.) </p>
<p>
Again, if the Antiphasis could be divided, and a half or intermediate
position found, as this theory contends, the division of it must be
admissible farther and farther, <i>ad infinitum</i>. After bisecting the
 Antiphasis, you can proceed to bisect each of the sections; and so on.
Each section will afford an intermediate term which may be denied with
reference to each of the two members of the original Antiphasis. Two new
 Antiphases will thus be formed, each of which may be bisected in the
same manner; and so bisection, with the formation of successive new
Antiphases, may proceed without end (p. 1012, a. 13).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page592" id="page592"></a>592</span>Again,
 suppose a questioner to ask you, Is this subject white? You answer, No.
 Now you have denied nothing else than the being-white: this is the
&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;, or negative member of the Antiphasis. But you have neither
denied nor affirmed the intermediate stage between the affirmative and
the negative; nor is there any answer possible by which you could do so.
 Therefore there is no real intermediate stage between them (&#7956;&#964;&#953; &#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;
&#7952;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#949;&#7984; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#960;&#8131; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8020;, &#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#941;&#966;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957; &#7970; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;·

15-38, and Bonitz’s note. Bonitz suggests, though timidly, &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#941;&#966;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;
instead of the common reading &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#954;&#949;&#957;, which none of the commentators
 explain, and which seems unintelligible. I think Bonitz is right,
though &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#941;&#966;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957; is an unknown tense from &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#953;: it is quite as
regular as &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#963;&#969; or &#7936;&#960;&#941;&#966;&#951;&#963;&#945;<span class="correction" title="stop omitted">.</span>). </p>
<p>
The doctrines which we have been just controverting (Aristotle says)
arise, like other paradoxes, either from the embarrassment in which men
find themselves when they cannot solve a sophistical difficulty; or from
 their fancying that an explanation may be demanded of every thing. In
replying to them, you must take your start from the definition, which
assigns to each word one fixed and constant signification. The doctrine
of Herakleitus — That all things are and all things are not — makes all
propositions true; that of Anaxagoras — That every thing is intermingled
 with every thing — makes all propositions false: such mixture is
neither good, nor not good; neither of the members of the Antiphasis is
true (a. 17-28). Our preceding reasonings have refuted both these
doctrines, and have shown that neither of the two one-sided extremes can
 be universally true: neither the doctrine — Every proposition is true;
nor that — Every proposition is false; still less that which comprehends
 them both — Every proposition is both true and false. Among these three
 doctrines, the second might seem the most plausible, yet it is
inadmissible, like the other two (b. 4).</p>
<p>
In debating with all these reasoners, you must require them (as we have
already laid down), not to admit either existence or non-existence but,
to admit a constant signification for each word. You must begin by
defining truth and falsehood; each of them belongs only to affirmation
in a certain way. Where the affirmation is true the denial is false; all
 propositions cannot be false; one member of each Antiphasis must be
true, and the other member must be false. Each of these doctrines
labours under the often-exposed defect — that it destroys itself (p.
1012, b. 14, &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#961;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; — allusion to the Theætetus, according to
Alexander). For whoever declares all propositions to be true, declares
the contradictory of this declaration to be true as well as the rest,
and therefore his own declaration not to be true. Whoever declares all
propositions to be false, declares his own declaration to be false as
well as all other propositions (b. 17). And, even if we suppose each of
these persons to make a special exception in regard to the particular
propositions here respectively indicated, still this will not serve. The
 man who declares all propositions to be false, will be compelled to
admit an infinite number of true propositions; because the proposition
declaring the true proposition to be true, must itself be true; a second
 proposition declaring this last to be true, will itself be true; and so
 on to a third, a fourth, &amp;c., in endless scale of ascent. The like
may be said about the man who declares all propositions to be true: he
too will be obliged to admit an infinite number of false propositions;
for that which declares a true proposition to be false, must itself be
false; and so on through a second, a third, &amp;c., in endless scale of
 ascent as in the former case (b. 22).</p>
<p>
It follows from what has been just proved, that those who affirm every
thing to be at rest, and those who affirm every thing to be in motion,
are both alike wrong. For, if every thing were at rest, the same
propositions would be always true and always false. But this is plainly
contrary to evidence; for the very reasoner who affirms it was once
non-existent, and will again be non-existent. On the other hand, if
every thing were in motion, no proposition would be true, and all would
be false: but we have proved above that this is not so. Nor is it true
that all things are alternately in motion or at rest; for there must be
something ever-moving and other things ever-moved — and this prime
movent must be itself immovable (p. 1012, b. 22-30).</p>

 Entia (p. 1025, b. 3). It is distinguished from other sciences, by
applying to all Entia, and in so far as they are Entia; for each of the
other sciences applies <span class="pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>593</span>itself
 to some separate branch of Entia, and investigates the causes and
principles of that branch exclusively. Each assumes either from data of
perception, or avowedly by way of hypothesis, the portion or genus of
Entia to which it applies; not investigating the entity thereof, but
pre-supposing this process to have been already performed by Ontology:
each then investigates the properties belonging <i>per se</i> to that
genus (b. 13). It is plain that by such an induction not one of these
sciences can demonstrate either the essence of its own separate genus,
nor whether that genus has any real existence. Both these questions —
both &#949;&#7984; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; and &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; — belong to Ontology (b. 18). (The belief
derived from perception and induction never amounts to demonstration, as
 has been shown in the Analytica; you may always contest the
universality of the conclusion—Alex. p. 734, b. 16, Br.)</p>
<p>
Apart from Ontology, each of these separate sciences is either
theoretical, or practical, or constructive (p. 1025, b. 21). Two of the
separate sciences are theoretical — Physics and Mathematics; and, as
Ontology (or Theology) is also theoretical, there are three varieties of
 theoretical science (p. 1026, a. 18).</p>
<p>
Physical Science applies to subjects having in themselves the principle
of mobility or change, and investigates, principally and for the most
part, the Essence or Form thereof; yet not exclusively the Form, for the
 Form must always be joined with Matter. The subject of Physics includes
 Matter in its definition, like hollow-nosed, not like hollow (p. 1025,
b. 33). All the animal and vegetable world is comprised therein; and
even some soul, as far as soul is inseparable from Matter (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962; <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#964;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962;'">&#7952;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;, &#8005;&#963;&#951; &#956;&#8052; &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957; — p. 1026, a. 5).</p>
<p>
Mathematics is another branch of theoretical science; applying to
subjects immovable and in part inseparable from Matter; that is,
separable from Matter only in logical conception (p. 1026, a. 7-15).</p>
<p>
Theology, or First Philosophy, or Ontology, is conversant with subjects
self-existent, immovable, and separable from Matter (p. 1026, a. 16).</p>
<p>
Now all causes are necessarily eternal; but these more than any other,
because they are the causes active among the visible divine bodies; for,
 clearly, if the Divinity has any place, it must be found among subjects
 of that nature; and the most venerable science must deal with the most
venerable subjects (p. 1026, a. 19). The theoretical sciences are more
worthy than the rest (&#945;&#7985;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#953;), and First Philosophy is the most
worthy among the theoretical sciences (a. 22). A man may indeed doubt
whether First Philosophy is distinguished from the other theoretical
sciences by being more universal, and by comprehending them all as
branches; or whether it has a separate department of its own, but more
venerable than the others; as we see that Mathematics, as a whole,
comprehends Geometry and Astronomy (a. 27). If there exist no other
distinct Essence beyond the compounds of Nature (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;
&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#954;&#965;&#943;&#945;&#962; — a. 28), Physics would be the first of all sciences. But
if there be a distinct immovable Essence, that is first; accordingly the
 science which deals with it is first, and, as being first, is for that
reason universal (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; — a. 30). It is the
province of this First Philosophy to theorize respecting Ens <i>quâ</i> Ens — what it is and what are its properties <i>quâ</i>
 Ens (a. 32). (Alexander says the First Philosophy is more universal
than the rest, but does not comprehend the rest: &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#8033;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#962;, &#959;&#8016; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#8033;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; — Schol.
 p. 736, a. 27.)</p>
<p>
Now Ens has many different meanings:— </p>
<p>
1. Ens &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;.</p>
<p>
2. Ens &#8033;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962; — Non-Ens &#8033;&#962; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;.</p>
<p>
3. Ens &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#967;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962; (decuple).</p>
<p>
4. Ens &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115;.</p>
<p>
1. Respecting the first, there can be no philosophical speculation (p.
1026, b. 3). No science, either theoretical, or practical, or
constructive, investigates Accidents. He who constructs a house, does
not construct all the accidents or concomitants of the house; for these
are endless and indeterminate. It may be agreeable to one man, hurtful
to a second, profitable to a third, and something different in relation
to every different Ens; but the constructive art called house-building
is not constructive of any one among these concomitants (b. 7-10). Nor
does the geometer investigate the analogous concomitants belonging to
his figures; it is no part of his province to determine whether a
triangle is different from a triangle having two right angles (b. 12).
This is easy to understand: the Concomitant is little more than a name —
 as it were, a name and nothing beyond (b. 13). Plato came near the
truth when he declared that Sophistic was busied about Non-Ens; for the
debates of the Sophists turn principally upon Accidents or Concomitants,
 such as, Whether musical and literary be the same or different? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>594</span>Whether
 Koriskus or literary Koriskus, be the same or different? Whether
everything which now is, but has not always been, has become; as in the
case of a man who being musical has become literary or being literary
has become musical? and such like debates (see Alexander, Schol. p. 736,
 b. 40). For the Concomitant or Accident appears something next door to
Non-Ens (&#7952;&#947;&#947;&#973;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, p. 1026, b. 21), as we may see by these
debates. Of other Entia there is generation or destruction, but of
Accidents there is none (b. 23).</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, we shall state, as far as the case admits, what is the
nature of the Accident, and through what cause it is (&#964;&#943;&#962; &#7969; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;,
 &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#940; &#964;&#953;&#957;’ &#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;· — p. 1026, b. 25): we shall perhaps at the
same time explain why there can be no science respecting it. Among
Entia, some are always and necessarily the same, others are usually but
not always the same. These which come to pass in neither of these two
ways, are called Accidents or Concomitants. Of the first two, the
Constant and the Usual, there is always some definite cause; of the
third, or Accidents, there is none: the cause of these is an Accident
(p. 1027, a. 8). In fact, Matter is the cause of Accidents, admitting as
 it does of being modified in a way different from the usual and
ordinary way (a. 13). It is plain that there can be neither science nor
teaching of Accidents: the teacher can teach only what is constant or
usual, and nothing beyond (a. 20).</p>
<p>
Now of these Accidents, there is a certain principle or cause which it
is indispensable to admit — Chance (&#7969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8001;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;’ &#7956;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#949;&#957; — p. 1027, b.
12). There must be principles and causes, generable and destructible,
yet which never are either generated or destroyed; if this were not so,
all events would occur by necessity (p. 1026, b. 29-31). (Thus the
builder, considered as cause of the house which he builds, has been
generated, <i>i.e.</i>, he has acquired the art of building and the proper accessories; and he will be destroyed, <i>i.e.</i>,
 he will lose his art, and its conditions of being exercised. But,
considered as the cause of the accidents belonging to the house, of its
being annoying or inconvenient to A or B, he has not been generated nor
will he be destroyed; <i>i.e.</i>, he has neither acquired, nor will he
lose, any skill or conditions tending to the production of this effect.
As the contact of two substances is not generated, but appears of itself
 along with the substances when they are generated; as the limits of
periods of time appear without generation along with the periods of time
 themselves; so the builder, when he acquires the power of building the
house, stands possessed thereby, without any additional time or special
generation, of the power to produce the concomitant accidents of the
house. The house is thus produced by necessity; its concomitant
accidents not by necessity — Alex. Schol. p. 738, a. 19-33.)</p>
<p>
But whether this &#964;&#8056; &#8001;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;’ &#7956;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#949;&#957; is to be considered as referable to
Matter, End, or Movent, is a point important to be determined (p. 1027,
b. 15). Aristotle shows elsewhere that it is referable to the last of
the three — &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957; (Asklepius, p. 738, b. 41).</p>
<p>
Having now said enough upon Ens <i>per Accidens</i>, we proceed to touch upon the second variety of Ens — Ens as the True, Non-Ens as the False.</p>
<p>
This variety of Ens depends upon conjunction and disjunction, and forms
an aggregate of two portions separately exhibited and brought together
in the Antiphasis. Such conjunction and disjunction is not in things
themselves; but in the act of intelligence which thinks the two things
together and not successively: in regard to simple matters and Essence,
not even any special conjoining act of intelligence is required; such
things must be conceived together, or not conceived at all (p. 1027, b.
27). The mental act of apprehension, in these cases, is one and
indivisible: you either have it entire at once, or not at all.</p>
<p>
The cause of this variety of Ens is to be found in a certain affection
of the intelligence; that of the preceding variety of Ens is an
undefined or indeterminate cause (b. 34). Both these two varieties of
Ens are peculiar, standing apart from what is most properly and <i>par excellence</i> Ens, <i>i.e.</i>, from the Ens according to the ten Categories, on which we shall now say something. </p>

</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Book Z.</span> </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have already stated that Ens is a &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; —
distinguished according to the ten figures or genera called Categories.
The first is &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, or &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; (<i>sensu dignissimo</i>) — Essentia,
Substantia (p. 1028, a. 15). The remaining Categories are all appendages
 of Essentia, presupposing it, and inseparable from it; whereas Essentia
 is separable from all of them, and stands first in reason, in
cognition, and in time. All the other Categories are called Entia only
because they are quantities, qualities, affections, &amp;c., of this
Essentia Prima. A man <span class="pagenum"><a name="page595" id="page595"></a>595</span>may even doubt whether they are Entia or Non-Entia, since none of them is either <i>per se</i> or separable. We ought hardly to say that a quality or an affection, enunciated abstractedly, is Ens at all — such as <i>currere</i>, <i>sedere</i>, <i>sanitas</i>: we ought more properly to say that <i>currens equus</i>, <i>sedens homo</i>, <i>sanus miles</i>,
 are Entia, enunciating along with the quality the definite Essence or
Individual Substance to which it belongs (a. 24). The quality then
becomes Ens, because the subject to which it belongs is an individual
Ens (a. 27). Essentia Prima is first in reason or rational explanation
(&#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;, a. 34), because in the rational explanation of each of the rest
that of Essentia is implicated. It is first also in cognition, because
we believe ourselves to know any thing fully, when we are able to answer
 <i>Quid est</i>? and say that it is <i>homo</i> or <i>ignis</i>; not simply when we are able to answer <i>Quale</i> or <i>Quantum est</i>? So that in answering the great and often-considered question, <i>Quid est Ens</i>? we shall first understand it as meaning Essentia (<i>hoc sensu dignissimo</i>), and shall try to solve it so (b. 3, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;).</p>
<p>
Essentia (understood in this sense) appears to belong in the most
manifest manner to bodies: we predicate it of animals, plants, the parts
 thereof, the natural bodies such as fire, water, and such like, as well
 as the parts and aggregates thereof, such as the heaven and its parts,
the stars, moon, and sun (p. 1028, b. 7-13). But are these the only
Essences, or are there others besides? Or again, is it an error to call <i>these</i>
 Essences, and are all Essences really something different from these?
This is a point to be examined. Some think that the limits of bodies
(surface, line, point, monad) are Essences even more than the body and
the solid: others admit no Essences at all beyond or apart from
Percipienda; others again recognize other Essences distinct from and
more eternal than the Percipienda; for example, Plato, who ranks Ideas
or Forms, and the Mathematica, as two distinct Essences, while he places
 the Percipienda only third in the scale of Essence. Speusippus even
enumerates a still greater number of Essences, beginning with the One,
and proceeding to Numbers, Magnitudes, Soul, &amp;c., with a distinct
&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942; or principle for each (b. 21). Some others hold that Forms and
Numbers have the same nature, and that there are other things coming
near to these, such as lines and surfaces, in a descending scale to the
Heaven and the Percipienda (b. 24). We must thus investigate which of
these doctrines are true or false, whether there are any Essences beyond
 the Percipienda; and, if so, how they exist: whether there is any
separable essence apart from Percipienda, and, if so, how and why; or
whether there is nothing of the kind. But first we must give a vague
outline what Essence is generally (&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#965;&#960;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;, b. 31).</p>
<p>
There are four principal varieties of meaning in this Essentia, &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#962; or <i>sensu dignissimo</i>: (1) &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, (2) &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965;, (3) &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;, (4) &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;.</p>
<p>
We shall first speak about the fourth — Substratum — which is the
subject of all predicates, but never itself the predicate of any
subject. That which appears most of all to be Essentia is, &#964;&#8056;
&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;. This name applies, in one point of view, to Matter;
in another, to Form; in a third, to the total result of the two
implicated together (p. 1029, a. 1): <i>e.g.</i>, the brass, the figure, and the complete statue of figured brass. If, therefore, the Form be <i>prius</i>, and more Ens, as compared with the Matter, it will be also <i>prius</i>
 and more Ens as compared with the complete result. We get thus far in
the adumbration of Essentia — that it is the subject of all predicates,
but never itself a predicate.</p>
<p>
But this is not sufficient to define it: there still remains obscurity.
It would seem that Matter is Essentia; and that, if it be not so,
nothing else is discernible to be so; for, if every thing else be
subtracted, nothing (save Matter) remains. All things else are either
affections, or agencies, or powers, of bodies; and, while length,
breadth, depth, &amp;c., are quantities belonging to Essence, Quantity
is not Essence, but something belonging to Essence as First Subject.
Take away length, breadth, depth, and there will remain only that
something which these three circumscribe; in other words, Matter — that
which, in itself and in its own nature, is neither Quantity, nor
Quality, but of which, Quantity, Quality, and the other Categories, are
predicated. All these Categories are predicated of Essence, and Essence
of Matter; so that Matter is the last remaining <i>per se</i> (p. 1029,
a. 12-24). Take away Matter, and there remain neither affirmative nor
negative predicates; for these negative predicates are just as much
concomitants or accidents as the others (a. 25).</p>
<p>
Upon this reasoning, it seems that Matter is the true Essence. Yet, on
the other hand, this will be seen to be impossible. For the principal
characteristic of Essence is to be separable and Hoc Aliquid. So that
either Form, or the Compound of Form and Matter together, must be the
true Essence. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id="page596"></a>596</span>But
 this last, the Compound, may be dismissed as evidently unsuitable for
the enquiry, not less than Matter separately; for it is manifestly
posterior to either of the two components (p. 1029, a. 30). We must
therefore investigate the Form, though it is full of difficulty (a. 33).</p>
<p>
We shall begin the investigation from some of the Percipienda, which are
 acknowledged as Essence; for it is useful to go across from this
starting-point to what is more cognizable (&#960;&#961;&#8056; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;
&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; — p. 1029, b. 3. These words ought properly to come
immediately after &#950;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; — p. 1028, a. 35, and the intervening
words now standing in the text, &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#948;’ &#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8135; — &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, ought to
be transferred to a more proper place some lines lower down, immediately
 before the words, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#960;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957; — p. 1029, b. 12. Bonitz has made
this very just correction in his Observatt. pp. 129-130, referred to in
his Notes on the Metaphysica.). Every man learns in this way — by
proceeding from what is less cognizable by nature to what is more
cognizable by nature. And the business (&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;) of learning consists in
making what is most cognizable to nature, most cognizable to ourselves
also; just as, in practical matters, proceeding from what is good for
each, to make what is good by nature good also for each man’s self. For
it will often happen that things first and most cognizable to each man’s
 self, are only faintly cognizable, and have little or nothing of Ens
(b. 9). Yet still, we must try to become cognizant of things fully
knowable, by beginning with things poorly knowable, but knowable to us
(b. 12).</p>
<p>
Taking up these Percipienda, for the purpose of searching for Essentia
in them, we shall first advert to &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, which we discriminated as
 one of the characteristics of Essentia, saying something about the
rational explanation or definition of it (p. 1029, a. 12). The &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of
 each subject is what is affirmed of it <i>per se</i> (&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.
&#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#8179; &#8003; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#972; — a. 13). Your essence is not to be musical;
you are not musical by yourself: your essence is, what you are <i>by yourself</i>.
 Nor does it even include all that you are by yourself. Surface is not
included in the essence of white; for the essence of surface is not the
same thing as the essence of white. Moreover white surface, the compound
 of both, is not the essence of white; because white itself is included
in the definition of white — which cannot be tolerated. The definition,
which explains &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., must not include the very word of which you
intend to declare the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. If you intend to declare the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of
white surface by the words smooth surface, this does not declare it all:
 you only declare that white is identical in meaning with smooth (b.
22).</p>
<p>
Now, since there are compounds in every one of the Categories, we must
enquire whether there is a &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. belonging to each of these. Is there,
for example, a &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. for white man? Let the meaning of these two words
be included in the single word garment. Is there a &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. for garment?
What is it to be a garment? You cannot answer; for neither is this an
enunciation <i>per se</i> (p. 1029, b. 29). Are we to say, indeed, that there are two distinct sorts of enunciation <i>per se</i>:
 one including an addition (&#7952;&#954; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;), the other, not? You may
define by intimating something to which the matter defined belongs; <i>e.g.</i>,
 in defining white you may give the definition of white man. Or you may
define by intimating something which is not essential but accessory to
the matter defined; <i>e.g.</i>, garment signifying white man, you may
define garment as white. Whereas the truth is, that, though a white man
is white, yet to be white is accessory and not essential to him (p.
1030, a. 1).</p>
<p>
But can we in any way affirm that there is any &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. to garment (taken
in the above sense)? Or ought we to say that there is none (p. 1030, a.
2; Bonitz. Obss. p. 120)? For the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. is of the nature of &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;
(&#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. — a. 3), or Hoc Aliquid, <i>i.e.</i>, a
 particular concrete; but, when one thing is affirmed of another, as
when we say white man, this is not of the nature of &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;, if &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;
belongs to Essences alone (a. 5). Thus it appears that &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; belongs
to all those matters of which the rational explanation can be given by
Definition. For to give the equivalent of a name in many other words is
not always to give a definition: if this were so, a paraphrase of any
length, even the Iliad, might be called a definition. There can be no
definition except of a primary something; which is affirmed, without
being affirmed as something about another (a. 10). There will be no
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;., therefore, except for species of a genus; for in these alone
what is affirmed is not an affection or an accessory or by way of
participation. Respecting every thing besides, there will be no &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.
or definition, but there may be a rational explanation (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;) of what
the name signifies, or a more precise explanation substituted in place
of a simpler (a. 16).</p>
<p>
Yet have we not gone too far in restricting the applicability of &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. and Definition?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page597" id="page597"></a>597</span> and ought we not rather to say, that both the one and the other are used in many different senses (p. 1030, a. 18)? For the <i>Quid est</i>
 (&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;) signifies in one way Essence and Hoc Aliquid, and in
different ways all the other Categories each respectively. To all of
them <i>Est</i> belongs, though not in like manner, but primarily to one and consequentially to the rest; so also <i>Quid est</i>
 belongs simply and directly to Essence, but in a certain way to the
others (a. 21). Respecting Quale, Quantum, and the rest, we may enquire <i>Quid Est</i>? so that Quale also comes under the <i>Quid est</i>, though not absolutely or directly (&#959;&#8016;&#967; &#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962;, a. 25), but analogously to Non-Ens; for some assert in words that <i>Est</i> belongs to Non-Ens also though not absolutely, viz., Non Ens <i>est</i> Non-Ens — (a. 26).</p>
<p>
Now we ought to be careful how we express ourselves about any particular
 matter, but we ought not to be less careful to determine how the matter
 itself really stands (p. 1030, a. 27: &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8182;&#962;
&#948;&#949;&#8150; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;, &#959;&#8016; &#956;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#957; &#947;&#949; &#7970; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8182;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;. This contrast
of &#960;&#8182;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957; with &#960;&#8182;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953; appears to refer to what had been said
two lines before: <span class="gesp">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span> &#966;&#945;&#963;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056;
&#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957; — verbal propositions distinguished from real.). The phraseology
used just before is clear, and we must therefore recognize that &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.,
as well as &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, belongs absolutely and primarily to Essentia, but in
 a secondary way to the other Categories; that is not absolutely, but
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8183; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., &#960;&#972;&#963;&#8179; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., &amp;c. (a. 31). For we must either declare
the Categories to be simply <i>æquivoca</i>, or we must recognize this
addition and subtraction of the separate title of each, like the
non-cognizable cognizable (&#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957; — a. 33. I
 do not understand these words, nor does the Scholiast or Bonitz explain
 them satisfactorily.). But the truth is, that they are neither <i>æquivoca</i> nor <i>univoca</i>,
 but in an intermediate grade of relation — not &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#7957;&#957;, but &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7957;&#957; (b.
 3.). People may express this in what phrases they like; but the truth
is, that there is both &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. and Definition, directly and primarily, of
 Essence; and of the other Categories also, but not directly and
primarily. Of white man, you may give a rational explanation and a
definition; but it will apply in a different manner to white and to the
essence of man (b. 12).</p>
<p>
There is a farther difficulty to be noticed. How are you to define any
matter not simple but essentially compound, where two or more elements
coalesce into an indivisible whole, like hollow-nosedness out of nose
and hollowness. Here we have hollow-nosedness and hollowness belonging
to the nose <i>per se</i>, not as an affection or accessory; not as
white belongs to Kallias or man, but as male belongs to animal, or equal
 to quantity, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>per se</i> (p. 1030, b. 20). The subject
is implicated with the predicate in one name, and you cannot enunciate
the one apart from the other. Such predicates belong to their subject <i>per se</i>,
 but in a different sense (see Bonitz’s note). You cannot properly
define them, in the sense given above (b. 27). If definitions of such
are to be admitted, it must be in a different sense: Definition and
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;. being recognized both of them as &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;. Definition
therefore is the mode of explanation which declares the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., and
belongs to Essences, either exclusively, or at least primarily,
directly, and chiefly (p. 1031, a. 7-14).</p>
<p>
We have now to enquire — Whether each particular thing, and its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.,
are the same, or different (p. 1031, a. 15). This will assist us in the
investigation of Essence; for apparently each thing is not different
from its own Essence, and the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. is said to be the Essence of each
thing.</p>
<p>
In regard to subjects enunciated <i>per accidens</i>, the above two
would seem to be distinct. White man is different from the being a white
 man. If these two were the same, the being a man would be the same as
the being a white man; for those who hold this opinion affirm that man,
and white man, are the same; and, if this be so, of course the being a
man must also be the same as the being a white man. Yet this last
inference is not necessary; for <i>same</i> is used in a different
sense, when you say, Man and white man are the same, and when you say,
The being a man and the being a white man are the same. But perhaps you
may urge that the two predicates may become the same <i>per accidens</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
 by being truly predicated of the same subject); and that, because you
say truly, Sokrates is white — Sokrates is musical, therefore you may
also say truly, The being white is the same as the being musical. But
this will be denied (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#948;’ &#959;&#8020; — p. 1031, a. 28).</p>
<p>
In regard to subjects enunciated <i>per se</i>, the case is otherwise: here each thing is the same with its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. Suppose, <i>e.g.</i>,
 there exist any Essentiæ (such as Plato and others make the Ideas)
prior to all others; in that case, if the &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957; were distinct from
&#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8183; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, and the &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; distinct from &#964;&#8056; &#950;&#8180;&#8179; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, there must
be other Essences and Ideas anterior to the Platonic Ideas. If we
believe &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. to be Essentia, it must be an Essentia anterior and
superior in dignity to these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>598</span>Ideas
 of Plato. Moreover, if the Essentiæ or Ideas, and the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., be
disjoined (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953; — p. 1031, b. 3), the first will be
uncognizable, and the last will be non-existent (&#964;&#8048; &#948;’ &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; — b.
4). For to have cognition of a thing, is, to know its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. This will
be alike true of all &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; all of them are alike existent or alike
non-existent (b. 9). If &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; be not identical with &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;,
neither is &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8183; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; identical with &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;, &amp;c. But that of
which &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8183; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; is not truly predicable, is not &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957; (b. 11).</p>
<p>
Hence we see that of necessity &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957; is one and the same with &#964;&#8056;
&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8183; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;; likewise &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957;, with &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8183; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;; and so in all cases
where the term enunciates a subject primarily and <i>per se</i>, not a
predicate of some other and distinct subject (p. 1031, b. 13: &#8005;&#963;&#945; &#956;&#8052;
&#954;&#945;&#964;’ &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945;). This last is the
characteristic and sufficient mark, even if the Platonic Ideas be not
admitted; and even more evidently so, if they be admitted (b. 14). It is
 at the same time clear that, if the Ideas be what Plato declares them
to be, the individual perceivable subjects here cannot be Essences; for
the Ideas are necessarily Essences, but not as predicable of a subject.
If they were Essences, in this last sense, they would be Essences <i>per participationem</i>; which is inconsistent with what is said about them by Plato (&#7956;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#957; — b. 18).</p>
<p>
These reasonings show that each separate thing, enunciated <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i>,
 is the same with its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; that to know each thing, is, to know its
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; that, if you proceed to expose or lay them out, both are one and
 the same (&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7956;&#954;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#7957;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7940;&#956;&#966;&#969; — p. 1031, b.
21; with Bonitz’s explanation of &#7956;&#954;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; in his Note).</p>
<p>
But that which is enunciated <i>per accidens</i> (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>album</i>, <i>musicum</i>)
 cannot be truly affirmed to be one and the same with its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.,
because it has a double signification: it signifies both the accident
and the subject to which such accident belongs; so that in a certain
aspect it is identical with its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., and in another aspect it is not
identical therewith (p. 1031, b. 26). The being a man, and the being a
white man, are not the same; but the subject for affection is the same
in both (b. 28: &#959;&#8016; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;, &#960;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972; — obscure). The absurdity of
supposing, that the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of a thing is different from the thing
itself, would appear plainly, if we gave a distinct name to the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.
For there must be another &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. above this, being the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of the
first &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; and it would be necessary to provide a new name for the
second &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; and so forward, in an ascending march <i>ad infinitum</i>.
 What hinders us from admitting some things at once, as identical with
their &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., if the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. be Essentia? (b. 31). We see from the
preceding reasoning that not only the thing itself is the same with its
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;., but that the rational explanation (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;) of both is the same;
for One, and the being One, are one and the same not <i>per accidens</i>, but <i>per se</i>
 (p. 1032, a. 2). If they were different, you would have to ascend to a
higher &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of the being One; and above this, to a higher still,
without end (a. 4).</p>
<p>
It is therefore clear that, in matters enunciated <i>per se</i> and
primarily, each individual thing is one and the same with its &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. The
 refutations brought by the Sophists against this doctrine, and the
puzzles which they start, <i>e.g.</i>, Whether Sokrates and the being
Sokrates are the same, — may be cleared up by the explanations just
offered (p. 1032, a. 8). It makes no difference what particular
questions the objector asks: one is as easy to solve as another (a. 10).</p>
<p>
Of things generated, some come by Nature, some by Art, some
Spontaneously. All generated things are generated out of something, by
something, and into or according to something (p. 1032, a. 12). The word
 <i>something</i> applies to each and all the Categories. Natural
generation belongs to all the things whose generation comes from Nature
(&#7952;&#954; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;); having &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958; &#959;&#8023; — what we call Matter, &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#966;’ &#959;&#8023; — one of
the things existing by nature (&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#953; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; — a. 17), and &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943;,
such as a man, a plant, or the like, which we call Essences in the
fullest sense (&#956;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962;). All things generated either by Nature or
 Art have Matter: it is possible that each of them may be, or may not
be; and this is what we call Matter in each (a. 20). As an universal
truth (&#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965;), Nature includes (1) That <i>out of which</i>, or Matter; (2) That <i>according to which</i> (&#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#8005;), every thing which is generated having a definite nature or Form, such as plant or animal; That <i>by which</i>,
 or nature characterized according to the Form, being the same Form as
the thing generated but in another individual; for a man begets a man
(a. 24).</p>
<p>
The other generations are called Constructions (&#960;&#959;&#953;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;), which are
either from Art, or from Power, or from Intelligence. It is with these
as with natural generations: some of them occur both by spontaneity and
by chance (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#962; — p. 1032, a. 29; the
principle of these last is apparently <span class="gesp">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>, the second of the three <i>principia</i> announced just before (?)); both in the one and in the other, some products <span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id="page599"></a>599</span>arise without seed as well as with seed, which we shall presently advert to.</p>
<p>
The generations from Art are those of which the Form is in the mind. By
Form I mean the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of each thing and its First Essence (&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#957;
&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;, p. 1032, b. 1). For, in a certain way, the Form even of
contraries is the same; since the essence of privation is the opposite
essence: for example, health is the essence of disease; for disease is
declared or described as absence of health, and health is the rational
notion existing in the mind and in science. Now a healthy subject is
generated by such an antecedent train of thought as follows (&#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8052;
 &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#947;&#953;&#8050;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962; — b. 6):— Since health is so and so, there is
necessity, if the subject is to attain health, that such and such things
 should occur, <i>e.g.</i>, an even temperature of the body, for which
latter purpose heat must be produced; and so on farther, until the
thought rests upon something which is in the physician’s power to
construct. The motion proceeding from this last thought is called
Construction (b. 10), tending as it does towards health. So that, in a
certain point of view, health may be said to be generated out of health,
 and a house out of a house; for the medical art is the form of health
and the building art the form of the house: I mean the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., or the
Essence without Matter, thereof (b. 14). Of the generations and motions
here enumerated, one is called Rational Apprehension, viz., that one
which takes its departure from the Principle and the Form; the other,
Construction, viz., that which takes its departure from the conclusion
of the process of rational apprehension (&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; —
 b. 17). The like may be said about each of the intermediate steps: I
mean, if the patient is to be restored to health, he must be brought to
an even temperature. But the being brought to an even temperature, what
is it? It is so and so; it will be a consequence of his being warmed.
And this last again — what is it? So and so; which already exists
potentially, since it depends upon the physician to produce it, the
means being at his command (&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#948;’ &#7972;&#948;&#951; &#7952;&#960;’ &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; — b. 21).</p>
<p>
We see thus that the Constructive Agency (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957;) and the point from
which the motion towards producing health takes its origin, is, when the
 process is one of Art, the Form present in the mind; and, when the
process is one of Spontaneity, it proceeds from that which would be the
first proceeding of the artist, if Art had been concerned. In the
medical art, <i>e.g.</i>, the artist begins by imparting warmth. He does
 this by rubbing. But this warmth might perhaps arise in the body
without any such rubbing or interference by the artist. The warmth is
the prime agent, in the case of spontaneous production. The warmth is
either a part of health, or a condition to the existence of health, as
bricks are to that of a house (p. 1032, b. 30).</p>
<p>
Nothing can be generated, if nothing pre-existed — as has been already
said before. Some part of what is generated must exist before: Matter
pre-exists, as in-dwelling and not generated (&#7969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#8021;&#955;&#951; &#956;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#962;· &#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;
 &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; — p. 1033, a. 1. I do not understand these last
words: it ought surely to be — &#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#959;&#8016;</span> &#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;. Bonitz’s explanation suits these last words better than it suits the words in the actual text.).</p>
<p>
But something of the Form or rational explanation (&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;) must
also pre-exist. In regard to a brazen circle, if we are asked, <i>Quid est</i>?
 we answer in two ways: We say of the Matter — It is brass; We say of
the Form — It is such and such a figure. And this is the genus in which
it is first placed (p. 1033, a. 4).</p>
<p>
The brazen circle has Matter in its rational explanation. But that which
 is generated, is called not by the name of the Matter out of which it
is generated, but by a derivative name formed therefrom; not &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;, but
 &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;. A statue is called not &#955;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;, but &#955;&#943;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;. But, when a man
is made healthy, he is not said to be the Matter out of which the health
 is generated; because that which we call the Matter is generated out of
 Privation along with the subject. Thus, both the man becomes healthy,
and the patient becomes healthy; but the generation is more properly
said to come out of Privation: we say, <i>Sanus ex ægroto generatur</i>, rather than, <i>Sanus ex homine generatur</i>
 (p. 1033, a. 12). In cases where the Privation is unmarked and unnamed,
 as, in the case of brass, privation of the spherical, or any other,
figure, and, in the case of a house, the privation of bricks or wood,
the work is said to be generated out of them like a healthy man out of a
 sick man (a. 14). Nevertheless the work is not called by the same name
as the material out of which it is made, but by a paronym thereof; not
&#958;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#957; but &#958;&#973;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; (a. 18). In strict propriety, indeed, we can hardly
say that the statue is made out of brass, nor the house out of wood; for
 the <i>materia ex quâ</i> ought to be something which undergoes change, not something which remains unchanged (a. 21).</p>
<p>
It was remarked that in Generation there are three things or aspects to be distinguished — </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page600" id="page600"></a>600</span>1. &#932;&#8056; &#8017;&#966;’ &#959;&#8023;, &#8005;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#7969; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;.</p>
<p>
2. &#932;&#8056; &#7952;&#958; &#959;&#8023; — rather &#8021;&#955;&#951; than &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;.</p>
<p>
3. &#932;&#943; &#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;.</p>
<p>
Having already touched upon the two first, I now proceed to the third.
What is it that is generated? Neither the Matter, nor the Form, but the
embodiment or combination of the two. An artisan does not construct
either the brass or the sphere, but the brazen sphere. If he be said to
construct the sphere, it is only by accident (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;), since
the sphere in this particular case happens to be of brass. Out of the
entire subject-matter, he constructs a distinct individual Something (p.
 1033, a. 31). To make the brass round, is not to make the round, or to
make the sphere, but to make a something different: that is the Form (of
 sphericity) embodied in another thing (a. 32). For, if the artisan made
 the round or the sphere, he must make them out of something different,
pre-existing as a subject: <i>e.g.</i>, he makes a brazen sphere, and in
 this sense — that he makes out of that Matter, which is brass, this
different something, which is a sphere. If he made the sphere itself —
the Form of sphere — he must make it out of some pre-existent subject;
and you would thus carry back <i>ad infinitum</i> the different acts of generation and different pre-existent subjects (b. 4).</p>
<p>
It is, therefore, clear that &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;, or by whatever name the shape of
the percipiend is to be called, is not generated, nor is generation
thereof possible; nor is there any &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. thereof; that is, of the Form
abstractedly: for it is this very &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. which is generated or becomes
embodied in something else, either by nature, or by art, or by
spontaneous power (p. 1033, b. 8). The artisan makes a brazen sphere to
exist, for he makes it out of brass (Matter), and the sphere (Form): he
makes or embodies the Form into this Matter, and that is a brazen sphere
 (b. 11). If there be any generation of the sphere <i>per se</i> (&#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#963;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8119; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;), it must be Something out of Something; for the Generatum
must always be resolvable into a certain Matter and a certain Form. Let
the brazen sphere be a figure in which all points of the circumference
are equidistant from the centre; here are three things to be considered:
 (1) That in which what is constructed resides; (2) That which does so
reside; (3) The entire Something generated or constructed — the brazen
sphere. We see thus plainly that what is called the Form or Essence
itself is not generated, but the combination called <i>according to the Form</i> is generated; moreover that in every Generatum there is Matter, so that the Generatum is in each case this or that (b. 19).</p>
<p>
Can it be true, then, that there exists any sphere or house beyond those which we see or touch (<i>i.e.</i>,
 any Form or Idea of a sphere, such as Plato advocates)? If there
existed any such, it could never have become or been generated into Hoc
Aliquid. It signifies only <i>tale</i>. It is neither This nor That nor any thing defined: but it (or rather the Constructive Agency) makes or generates <i>ex hoc tale</i>; and when this last has been generated, it is Tale Hoc (p. 1033, b. 22), and the entire compound is Kallias, or Sokrates, or <i>this</i>
 brazen sphere, while man, animal, &amp;c., are analogous to brazen
sphere generally. Even if there exist Platonic Forms by themselves, they
 could be of no use towards generation or the production of Essences.
Frequently it is obvious that the Generans is like the Generatum, only a
 different individual. There is no occasion to assume the Platonic Form
as an Exemplar; for the generating individual is quite sufficient of
itself to be the cause of the Form in a new mass of Matter. The entire
result is the given Form in these particular bones and flesh — called
Kallias or Sokrates: each is different so far as Matter, but the same in
 the Form; for the Form is indivisible (p. 1034, a. 7).</p>
<p>
But how does it happen that there are some things which are generated sometimes by art, sometimes spontaneously (<i>e.g.</i>, health), while in other things (<i>e.g.</i>,
 a house) spontaneous production never takes place? The reason is, that,
 in the first class of cases, the Matter which governs the work of
generation by the artist, and in which itself a part of the finished
product resides, is of a nature to be moved or modified by itself,
while, in the second, this is not the fact; and to be moved, besides, in
 a certain manner and direction; for there are many things which are
movable by themselves, but not in such manner and direction as the case
which we are supposing requires. For example, stones are incapable of
being moved in certain directions except by some other force, but they
are capable of being moved by themselves in another direction; the like
with fire. It is upon this that the distinction turns between some
results which cannot be realized without an artist, and others which may
 perhaps be so realized (a. 17).</p>
<p>
It is plain from what has been said that, in a certain sense, everything
 is generated from something of the same name, as natural objects are (<i>e.g.</i>,
 a man); or from something in part bearing the same name (as a house out
 of the ideal form of a house), or from something which possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page601" id="page601"></a>601</span>
 that which in part bears the same name; for the first cause of the
generation is itself part of the thing generated. The heat in the motion
 generates heat in the body; and this is either health, or a part of
health, or the antecedent of one or other of these; hence it is said to
produce or generate health, because it produces that of which health is
concomitant and consequent (p. 1034, a. 30; see Bonitz’s correction in
his Note). Essence is in these cases the beginning or principle of all
generations, just as in Demonstration it is the beginning or principle
of all syllogisms (a. 33). In the combinations and growths of Nature,
the case is similar. The seed constructs, as Art constructs its
products; for the seed has in it potentially the Form, and that from
which comes the seed is, in a certain manner, of the same name with the
product (b. 1). For we must not expect to find <i>all</i> generations
analogous to that of man from man — woman also is generated from man,
moreover, mule is not generated from mule — though this is the usual
case, when there is no natural bodily defect (b. 3). Spontaneous
generation occurs in the department of Nature, as in that of Art,
wherever the Matter can be moved by itself in the same manner as the
seed moves it: wherever the Matter cannot be so moved by itself, there
can be no generation except the natural, from similar predecessors (b.
7, &#7952;&#958; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957; — compare Bonitz's note: “non ex ipsis, sed &#7952;&#958; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;”).</p>
<p>
This doctrine — That the Form is not generated, does not belong to
Essence alone, but also to all the other Categories alike — Quality,
Quantity, and the rest (p. 1034, b. 9). It is not the Form Quality <i>per se</i> which is generated, but <i>tale lignum</i>, <i>talis homo</i>: nor the Form Quantity <i>per se</i>, but <i>tantum lignum</i> or <i>animal</i>
 (b. 15). But, in regard to Essence, there is thus much peculiar and
distinctive as compared with the other Categories: in the generation of
Essence, there must pre-exist as generator another <i>actual</i> and <i>complete</i> Essence; in the generation of Quality or Quantity, you need nothing pre-existing beyond a <i>potential</i> Quality or a <i>potential</i> Quantity (b. 16).</p>
<p>
A difficult question arises in this way: Every definition is a rational
explanation consisting of parts; and, as the parts of the explanation
are to the whole explanation, so are the parts of the thing explained to
 the whole thing explained. Now is it necessary or not, that the
rational explanation of the parts shall be embodied in the rational
explanation of the whole (p. 1034, b. 22)? In some cases it appears to
be so; in others, not. The rational explanation of a circle does not
include that of its segments; but the rational explanation of a syllable
 does include that of its component letters. Moreover, if the parts are
prior to the whole, and if the acute angle be a part of the right angle,
 and the finger a part of the man, the acute angle must be prior to the
right angle, and the finger to the man. Yet the contrary seems to be the
 truth: the right angle seems prior, also the man; for the rational
explanation of acute angle is given from right angle, that of finger
from man: in respect to existing without the other, right angle and man
seem <i>priora</i>. In fact the word <i>part</i> is equivocal, and it is
 only one of its meanings to call it — that which quantitatively
measures another (b. 33). But let us dismiss this consideration, and let
 us enquire of what it is that Essence consists, as parts (b. 34). If
these are (1) Matter, (2) Form, (3) The Compound of the two, and if each
 of these three be Essence, Matter must be considered, in a certain way,
 as a part of something, yet in a certain way as not so; in this latter
point of view, nothing being a part except those elements out of which
the rational explanation of the Form is framed (p. 1035, a. 2). Thus,
flesh is not a part of flatness, being the matter upon which flatness is
 generated or superinduced, but flesh is a part of flat-nosedness; the
brass is a part of the entire statue, but not a part of the statue when
enunciated as Form, or of the ideal statue. You may discriminate and
reason separately upon the statue considered as Form (apart from the
complete statue); but you cannot so discriminate the material part <i>per se</i>,
 or the statue considered as Matter only (a. 7). Hence the rational
explanation of the circle does not contain that of the segments of the
circle; but the rational explanation of the syllable does contain that
of the component letters. The letters are parts of the Form, and not
simply the Matter upon which the Form is superinduced; but the segments
are parts in the sense of being the Matter upon which the Form of the
circle is superinduced (a. 12): they are, however, nearer to the Form
than the brass, when the Form of a circle or roundness is generated in
brass (a. 13). In a certain way, indeed, it cannot be said that <i>all</i> the letters are contained in the rational explanation of the syllables; <i>e.g.</i>,
 the letters inscribed in wax are not so contained, nor the sounds of
those letters vibrating in the air; both these are a part of the
syllable, in the sense of being the perceivable matter thereof (a. 17:
&#8033;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#942;). If a man be destroyed by being reduced to bones,
ligaments, and flesh, you cannot for that reason say, that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page602" id="page602"></a>602</span>man
 is composed of these as of parts of his Essence, but as parts of his
Matter: they are parts of the entire man, but not of the Form, nor of
what is contained in the rational explanation; accordingly they do not
figure in the discussions which turn upon rational explanation, but only
 when the discussions turn upon the entire or concrete subject (a. 23).
Hence, in some cases, things are destroyed into the same <i>principia</i>
 out of which they are formed; in other cases, not. To the first class,
belong all things which are taken in conjunction with Matter, such as
the flat-nosed or, the brazen circle; to the second class, those which
are taken disjoined from Matter, with Form only. Objects of the first
class, (<i>i.e.</i>, the concretes) have thus both <i>principia</i> and
parts subordinate; but neither the one nor the other belong to the Form
alone (a. 31). The plaster-statue passes when destroyed into plaster,
the brazen circle into brass, Kallias into flesh and bones; and even the
 circle, when understood in a certain sense, into its segments, for the
term circle is used equivocally, sometimes to designate the Form of a
circle, sometimes to designate this or that particular circle —
particular circles having no name peculiar to themselves (b. 3).</p>
<p>
That which has been already said is the truth; yet let us try to
recapitulate it in a still clearer manner (p. 1035, b. 4). The parts of
the rational explanation or notion, into which that notion is divided,
are prior to the notion, at least in some instances. But the notion of a
 right angle is prior to that of an acute angle or is one of the
elements into which the notion of an acute angle is divided; for you
cannot define an acute angle without introducing the right angle into
your definition, nor can you define the semicircle without introducing
the circle, nor the finger without introducing the man — the finger
being such and such a part of the man. The parts into which man is
divided as Matter, are posterior to man; those into which man is divided
 as parts of his Form or Formal Essence, are prior to man — at least
some of them are so (b. 14). Now, since the soul of animals (which is
the Essence of the animated being — b. 15) is the Essence and the Form
and the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. of a suitably arranged body; and, since no good
definition of any one part can be given, which does not include the
function of that part, and this cannot be given without the mechanism of
 sense (b. 18), it follows that the parts of this soul, or some of them
at least, are prior to the entire animal, alike in the general and in
each particular case. But the body and its parts are posterior to the
soul or Form, and into these, as parts, the entire man (not the Essence
or Form) is divided. These parts are, in a certain sense, prior to the
entire man, and, in a certain sense, not; for they cannot even exist at
all separately (b. 23): the finger is not a finger unless it can perform
 its functions, <i>i.e.</i>, unless it be animated by a central soul; it
 is not a finger in every possible state of the body to which it
belongs; after death, it is merely a finger by equivocation of language.
 There are, however, some parts, such, as the brain or heart, to which
the Form or Essence is specially attached which are neither prior nor
posterior but <i>simul</i> to the entire animal (b. 25).</p>
<p>
Man, horse, and such like, which are predicated universally of
particular things, are not Essentia; they are compounds of a given Form
and a given Matter (but of that first Matter) which goes to compose
Universals. It is out of the last Matter, which comes lowest in the
series, and is already partially invested with Form, that Sokrates and
other particular beings are constituted (p. 1035, b. 30).</p>
<p>
Thus, there are parts of the Form or &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., parts of the Matter, and
parts of the Compound including both. But it is only the parts of the
Form that are included as parts in the rational explanation or notion;
and this notion belongs to the Universal; for circle and the being a
circle, soul and the being a soul — are one and the same (p. 1036, a.
2). Of the total compound (this particular circle), no notion, no
definition, can be given: whether it be a particular circle perceivable
by sense, in wood or brass, or merely conceivable, such as the
mathematical figures. Such particular circles are known only along with
actual perception or conception (a. 6. &#925;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957; here means the equivalent
of &#7936;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957; = &#967;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#8115; — “die Thätigkeit des Abstrahirens,
durch welche das Mathematische gewonnen wird” — Schwegler ad loc. Comm.,
 p. 101, Pt. II.): when we dismiss them as actualities from our view or
imagination, we cannot say clearly whether they continue to exist or
not; but we always talk of them and know them by the rational
explanation or definition of the universal circle (a. 7: &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#948;’

here speaking of the &#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962; only, not of the &#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962; or
&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;. He had before told us that, when the &#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;
passes out of &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945; or &#966;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, it passes into &#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#972;&#962;. He can
hardly therefore mean to say that, when the &#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#962; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>603</span>&#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;
 passes out of &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;, we do not clearly know whether it exists or
not. But respecting the &#954;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962; or mathematical circle, he might
well say that we did not clearly know whether it existed at all under
the circumstances supposed: if it cease to exist, we cannot say &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8003;
&#966;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;). Matter is unknowable <i>per se</i> (&#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#942;&#957; — a. 9, <i>i.e.</i>,
 if altogether without Form). One variety of Matter is perceivable by
sense, as brass, wood, and all moveable matter; another variety is
conceivable, viz., that which exists in the perceivable variety, but not
 <i>quâ</i> perceivable — the mathematical figures (&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8052; &#948;&#8050; &#7969; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945; &#956;&#8052; &#8087; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;, &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940; — a. 12; <i>i.e.</i>,
 making abstraction of the acts of sense, or of what is seen and felt by
 sense, viz., colour by the eye, resistance by the touch; and leaving
behind simply the extension or possibility of motion, which is a
geometrical line).</p>
<p>
We have now laid down the true doctrine respecting Whole and Part, Prius
 and Posterius. And, if any one asks whether the right angle, the
circle, the animal, is prior or not to the parts into which it is
divided and out of which it is formed, we cannot answer absolutely
either Yes or No. We must add some distinguishing words, specifying what
 we assert to be prior, and to what it is prior (p. 1036, a. 19). If by
the soul you mean the Form or Essence of the living animal, by the
circle, the Form of the circle, by the right angle, the Form or Essence
thereof, — then this Form is posterior in regard to the notional parts
of which it is constituted, but prior in regard to the particular circle
 or right angle. But, if by soul you meant the entire concrete animal,
by right angle or circle, these two figures realized in brass or wood,
then we must reply that any one of these is prior as regards the
material parts of which it is constituted (a. 25).</p>
<p>
Another reasonable doubt arises here (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;’ &#949;&#7984;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#969;&#962; — p. 1036, a.
 26) as to which parts belong to the Form alone, which to the entire
Concrete. Unless this be made clear, we can define nothing; for that
which we define is the Universal and the Form, and, unless we know what
parts belong to the Matter and what do not, the definition of the thing
can never be made plain (a. 30). Now, wherever the Form is seen to be
superinduced upon matters diverse in their own Form, the case presents
no difficulty: every one sees circles in brass, stone, wood, &amp;c.,
and is well aware that neither the brass, nor the stone, belongs to the
Form or Essence of the circle, since he easily conceives a circle
without either. But, if a man had never seen any circles except brazen
circles, he would have more difficulty in detaching mentally the circle
from the brass, and would be more likely to look upon brass as belonging
 to the Form of circle; although, in point of fact, he would have no
more logical ground for supposing so than in the case just before
supposed; for the brass might still belong only to the Matter of circle
(b. 2). This is the case with the Form of man. It is always seen
implicated with flesh, bones, and such like parts. Are these parts of
the Form of man? Or are they not rather parts of the Matter, though we
are unable to conceive the Form apart from them, because we never see it
 in conjunction with any other Matter? This is at least a possibility,
and we cannot see clearly in what cases it must be admitted. Some
theorists are so impressed by it as to push the case farther, and apply
the same reasoning to the circle and triangle. These theorists contend
that it is improper to define a circle and a triangle by figure, lines,
continuity, &amp;c., which (they affirm) are only parts of the Matter of
 circle and triangle; as flesh and bones are parts of the Matter of man.
 They refer all of them to numbers as the Form, and they affirm that the
 definition of the dyad is also the definition of a line (b. 12). Among
the partisans of Ideas, some call the dyad &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#942; others call it the
 Form of a line; saying that in some cases the Form and that of which it
 is the Form are the same, as the dyad and the Form of the dyad, but
that this is not true about line. (These two opinions seem to be
substantially the same, and only to differ in the phrase. &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#942;
means the same as &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8134;&#962;: it seems to have been a peculiar
 phrase adopted by some Platonists, but not by all. Others preferred to
say &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8134;&#962;.) These reasonings have already misled the
Pythagoreans, and are likely to mislead others also: they would conduct
us to the recognition of one and the same Form in many cases where the
Form is manifestly different: they lead us even to assume one single
Form universally, reducing every thing besides to be no Form, but merely
 Matter to that one single real Form. By such reasoning, we should be
forced to consider all things as One (b. 20), which would be obviously
absurd.</p>
<p>
We see from hence that there are real difficulties respecting the theory
 of Definition, and how such difficulties arise. It is because some
persons are forward overmuch in trying to analyse <span class="pagenum"><a name="page604" id="page604"></a>604</span>every
 thing and in abstracting altogether from Matter; for some things
include Matter along with the Form, or determined in a certain way, <i>i.e.</i>,
 this along with that, or these things in this condition (p, 1036, b.
22). The comparison which the younger Sokrates was accustomed to make
about the animal is a mistaken one (b. 24): it implies that man may be
without his material parts, as the circle may exist without brass. But
this analogy will not hold; animal is something perceivable by sense and
 cannot be defined without motion; of course, therefore, not without
bodily members organized in a certain way (b. 30). The hand is not a
part of man, when it is in any supposable condition, but only when it
can perform its functions, that is, when it is animated; when not
animated, it is not a part (b. 32). Clearly the soul is the first
Essence or Form, the body is Matter, and man or animal is the compound
of both as an Universal; while Sokrates, Koriskus &amp;c., are as
particulars to this Universal, whether you choose to take Sokrates as
soul without body, or as soul with body (p. 1037, a. 5-10: these words
are very obscure).</p>
<p>
Respecting Mathematical Entia, why are not the notions of the <span class="correction" title="amended from 'parts'">parts parts</span> of the notion of the whole? <i>e.g.</i>,
 why is not the notion of a semi-circle part of the notion of a circle?
Perhaps it will be replied that this circle and semi-circle are not
perceivable by sense: but this after all makes no difference; for some
things even not perceivable by sense involve Matter along with them, and
 indeed Matter is involved in every thing which is not &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. and Form
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#972;. The semi-circles are not included as parts of the notion
 of the universal circle; but they are parts of each particular circle:
for there is one Matter perceivable and another cogitable (p. 1036, a.
34. — Bonitz remarks that these words from p. 1036, a. 22 to p. 1037, a.
 5, are out of their proper place). Whether there be any other Matter,
besides the Matter of these Mathematical Entia, and whether we are to
seek a distinct Form and Essence for them — such as numbers, must be
reserved for future enquiry. This has been one of our reasons for the
preceding chapters about perceivable Essences; for these last properly
belong to the province of Second Philosophy — of the physical theorist
(&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957; — p. 1037, a. 15). The
physical philosopher studies not merely the Matter, but the Form or
notional Essence even more (a. 17).</p>
<p>
We are now in a position to clear up what was touched upon in the
Analytica (Anal. Poster. II. p. 92, a. 27; also, De Interp. v. p. 17, a.
 13), but not completed, respecting Definition. How is it that the
definition is One? We define man <i>animal bipes</i>: How is it that
this is One and not Many? Man and white are two, when the latter does
not belong to the former: when it does so belong to and affects the
former, the two are One — white man (p. 1037, b. 16): that is, they are
One &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;. But the parts included in the definition are not One
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;, nor are they one &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#957;; for the Genus cannot be said
to partake of the Differentiæ. If it did, it would at one and the same
time partake of Opposita, for the Differentiæ are Opposita to each
other. And, even if we say that the Genus does partake of the
Differentiæ, the same difficulty recurs, when the Differentiæ are
numerous. The Genus must partake alike and equally of all of them; but
how is it that all of them are One, and not Many? It cannot be meant
that all of them belong essentially to the thing; for, if that were so,
all would be included in the definition, which they are not. We want to
know why or how those Differentiæ which are included in the definition
coalesce into One, without the rest: for we call the <i>definiend</i> &#7957;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; (b. 27).</p>
<p>
In answering this question, we take, as a specimen, a definition which
arises out of the logical subdivision of a Genus (p. 1037, b. 28).
Definition is given by assigning the Genus and Difference: the Genus is
the Matter, the Difference is the Form or Essence; the two coalesce into
 one as Form and Matter. In the definition of man — <i>animal bipes</i> — <i>animal</i> is the Matter and <i>bipes</i>
 the Form; so that the two coalescing form an essential One. It does not
 signify through how many stages the logical subdivision is carried,
provided it be well done; that is, provided each stage be a special and
appropriate division of all that has preceded. If this condition be
complied with, the last differentia will include all the preceding, and
will itself be the Form of which the genus serves as Matter. You divide
the genus animal first into &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; — &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#8166;&#957;; you next divide
&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; into &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; — &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;; or
perhaps into &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#963;&#967;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#960;&#965;&#957; — &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#7940;&#963;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;. It is
essential that the next subdivision applied to &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; should be
founded upon some subordinate differentia specially applying to the feet
 (p. 1038, a. 14: &#945;&#8023;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#962;· &#7969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#963;&#967;&#953;&#950;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;
&#964;&#953;&#962;). If it does not specially apply to the feet, but takes in some new
attribute (<i>e. g.</i>, &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &#7940;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;), the division will <span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id="page605"></a>605</span>be
 unphilosophical. The last differentia &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; includes the
preceding differentia &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;: to say &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; would be
tautology. Where each differentia is a differentia of the preceding
differentiæ, the last differentia includes them all and is itself the
Form and Essence, along with the genus as Matter (a. 25). The definition
 is the rational explanation arising out of these differences, and by
specifying the last it virtually includes all the preceding (a. 29: &#8001;
&#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957; &#8001; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#940; &#947;&#949;
 &#964;&#8056; &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#972;&#957;).</p>
<p>
In the constituents of the Essence, there is no distinctive order of parts; no subordination of <i>prius</i> and <i>posterius</i>; all are equally essential and coordinate (&#964;&#940;&#958;&#953;&#962; &#948;’ &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#8115; — p. 1038, a. 33).</p>
<p>
As we are treating now about Essence, it will be convenient to go back
to the point from which we departed, when we enumerated the four
varieties recognized by different philosophers. These were (1) The
Subject — Substratum — Matter, which is a subject of predicates in two
different ways: either as already an Hoc Aliquid and affected by various
 accidents, or as not yet an Hoc Aliquid, but simply Matter implicated
with Entelechy (p. 1038, b. 6); (2) Form — Essence — the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.; (3) The
 Compound or Product of the preceding two; (4) The Universal (&#964;&#8056;
&#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965;). Of these four, we have already examined the first three; we
now proceed to the fourth.</p>
<p>
Some philosophers consider the Universal to be primarily and eminently
Cause and Principle (p. 1038, b. 7). But it seems impossible that any
thing which is affirmed universally can be Essence. For that is the
First Essence of each thing which belongs to nothing but itself; but the
 Universal is by its nature common to many things. Of which among these
things is it the Essence? Either of all or of no one. Not of all
certainly; and, if it be the Essence of any one, the rest of them will
be identical with that one; for, where the Essence is one, the things
themselves are one (b. 15). Besides, the Essence is that which is not
predicated of any subject: but the Universal is always predicated of a
subject.</p>
<p>
Perhaps, however, we shall be told, that the Universal is not identical
with &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., but is Essence which is immanent in or belongs to &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.,
as animal in man and horse. But this cannot be admitted. For, whether we
 suppose animal to be definable or not, if it be essence of any thing,
it must be the essence of something to which it belongs peculiarly, as <i>homo</i>
 is the essence of man peculiarly; but, if animal is to be reckoned as
the essence of man, it will be the essence of something to which it does
 not peculiarly belong; and this contradicts the definition of Essence
(p. 1038, b. 15-23. This passage is very obscure, even after Bonitz and
Schwegler’s explanatory notes. I incline to Schwegler, and to his
remark, Comm. II. p. 115, that the text of b. 23 ought to be written &#7952;&#957; &#8103;
 <span class="gesp">&#956;&#8052;</span> &#8033;&#962; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;.).</p>
<p>
Again, it is impossible that Essence, if composed of any elements, can
be composed of what is not Essence, as of Quality; for this would make
Quality <i>prius</i> as regards Essence; which it cannot be, either in
reason (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;), or in time, or in generation. If this were so, the
affections would be separable from Essences (p. 1038, b. 28). Essence,
if composed of any thing, must be composed of Essence.</p>
<p>
Once more, if the individual man or horse are Essences, nothing which is
 in the definition of these can be Essence; nor apart from that of which
 it is Essence; nor in any thing else. There cannot be any man, apart
from individual men (p. 1038, b. 34).</p>
<p>
Hence we see clearly that none of the universal predicates are Essence:
none of them signify Hoc Aliquid, but Tale. To suppose otherwise, would
open the door to many inadmissible consequences, especially to the
argument of the ‘Third Man’ (p. 1039, a. 2).</p>
<p>
Another argument to the same purpose:— It is impossible that Essence can
 be composed of different Essences immanent in one Entelechy. Two in the
 same Entelechy can never be One in Entelechy. If indeed they be two <i>in potentiâ</i>,
 they may coalesce into one Entelechy, like one double out of two
potential halves. But Entelechy establishes a separate and complete
existence (p. 1039, a. 7); so that, if Essence is One, it cannot be made
 up of distinct Essences immanent or inherent. Demokritus, who
recognized only the atoms as Essences, was right in saying, that two of
them could not be One, nor one of them Two. The like is true about
number, if number be, as some contend, a synthesis of monads. For either
 the dyad is not One; or else the monads included therein are not monads
 &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#8115; (a. 14).</p>
<p>
Here however we stumble upon a difficulty. For, if no Essence can be put
 together out of Universals, nor any compound Essence out of other
Essences existing as Entelechies, all Essence must necessarily be simple
 and uncompounded, so that no definition can be given of it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id="page606"></a>606</span>But
 this is opposed to every one’s opinion, and to what has been said long
ago, that Essence alone could be defined; or at least Essence most of
all. It now appears that there can be no definition of Essence, nor by
consequence of any thing else. Perhaps, however this may be only true in
 a certain sense: in one way, definition is possible; in another way,
not. We shall endeavour to clear up the point presently (p. 1039, a. 22.
 — Schwegler says in his note upon this passage: “Die von Aristoteles
häufig berührte, doch nie zur abschliessenden Lösung gebrachte,
Grundaporie des aristotelischen Systems” — Comm. II. p. 117). </p>
<p>
Those who maintain that Ideas are self-existent are involved in farther
contradictions by admitting at the same time that the Species is
composed out of Genus and Differentia. For, suppose that these Ideas are
 self-existent and that &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; exists both in man and horse: &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957;
is, in these two, either the same or different numerically. It is, of
course, the same in definition or notion (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;); of that there can be no
 doubt. If it be numerically same (&#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#963;&#8166; &#963;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8183;) in man and in horse,
how can this same exist at once in separate beings, unless we suppose
the absurdity that it exists apart from itself (p. 1039, b. 1)? Again,
are we to imagine that this generic Ens, &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957;, partakes at the same
time of contrary differentiæ — the dipod, polypod, apod? If it does not,
 how can dipodic or polypodic animals really exist? Nor is the
difficulty at all lessened, if, instead of saying that the generic Ens
partakes of differentiæ, you say that it is <i>mixed</i> with them, or <i>compounded</i> of them, or <i>in contact</i> with them. There is nothing but a tissue of absurdities (&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#945; — b. 6).</p>
<p>
But take the contrary supposition and suppose that the &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; is
numerically different in man, horse, &amp;c. On this admission, there
will be an infinite number of distinct beings of whom the &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; is
the Essence; man, for example, since animal is not accidental, but
essential, as a constituent of man (p. 1039, b. 8). &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; will thus
be Many (“ein Vielerlei” — Schwegler); for it will be the Essence of
each particular animal, of whom it will be predicated essentially and
not accidentally (&#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#940;&#964;’ &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; — <i>i.e.</i>, this is not a
case where the predicate is something distinct from the subject).
Moreover all the constituents of man will be alike Ideas (<i>e.g.</i>,
not merely &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957;, but &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;): now the same cannot be Idea of one thing
and Essence of another; accordingly, &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; will be each one of the
essential constituents of particular animals (&#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;, &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;, b. 14).</p>
<p>
Again, whence comes &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; itself, and how do the particular animals
arise out of it? How can the &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; which is Essence, exist apart from and
 alongside of &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8056; &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957;? (p. 1039, b. 15.)</p>
<p>
These arguments show how impossible it is that there can exist any such Ideas as some philosophers affirm (p. 1039, b. 18).</p>
<p>
We have already said that there are two varieties of Essence: (1) The
Form alone, (2) The Form embodied in Matter. The Form or Essence in the
first meaning, is neither generable nor destructible; in the second
meaning it is both. &#932;&#8056; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#8115; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; is neither generable nor
destructible; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8135;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#8135; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#8115; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; is both the one and the other (p.
1039, b. 25). Of these last, therefore, the perceivable or concrete
Essences, there can be no definition nor demonstration, because they are
 implicated with Matter, which is noway necessary, or unchangeable, but
may exist or not exist, change or not change. Demonstration belongs only
 to what is necessary; Definition only to Science, which cannot be
to-day Science and to-morrow Ignorance. Neither Science, nor
Demonstration, nor Definition, applies to such things as may be
otherwise: these latter belong to Opinion (&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; —
 p. 1040, a. 1). You cannot have Science or Demonstration or Definition
about particular or perceivable things, because they are destroyed and
pass out of perception, so that you do not know what continues to be
true about them; even though you preserve the definition in your memory,
 you cannot tell how far it continues applicable to them (a. 7). Any
definition given is liable to be overthrown.</p>
<p>
Upon the same principle, there cannot be any definition of the Platonic
Ideas; each of which is announced as a particular, distinct, separable,
Ens (p. 1040, a. 8). The definition must be composed of words — of the
words of a language generally understood — and of words which, being
used by many persons, are applicable to other particulars besides the
definiend (you define Alexander as white, thin, a philosopher, a native
of Aphrodisias, &amp;c., all of which are characteristics applicable to
many other persons besides). The definer may say that each
characteristic taken separately will apply to many things, but that the
aggregate of all together will apply to none except the definiend. We
reply however, that &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; must have at least two subjects to which
 it applies — &#964;&#8056; &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;. Of course this is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607"></a>607</span>all
 the more evident about eternal Entia like the Platonic Ideas, which are
 prior to the compound and parts thereof (&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; and &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957; are each prior
 and both of them parts of &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;), and separable, just as
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; is separable (a. 14-20); for either neither of them is
separable, or both are so. If neither of them is separable, then the
Genus is nothing apart from the Species, and the Platonic assumption of
self-existent Ideas falls to the ground; if both are separable, then the
 Differentia is self-existent as well as the Genus (a. 21): there exist
some Ideas prior to other Ideas. Moreover, the Genus and Differentia,
the component elements of the Species, are logically prior to the
Species: suppress the Species, and you do not suppress its component
elements; suppress these, and you <i>do</i> suppress the Species (a.
21). We reply farther that, if the more compound Ideas arise out of the
less compound, the component elements (like &#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#957;) must needs be
predicable of many distinct subjects. If this be not so always, how are
we to distinguish the cases in which it is true from those in which it
is not? You must assume the existence of some Idea which can only be
predicated of some one subject, and no others. But this seems
impossible. Every Idea is participable (a. 27).</p>
<p>
These philosophers do not reflect that definition is impossible of
eternal Essences (which the Platonic Ideas are), especially in cases
where the objects are essentially unique, as Sun, or Moon, or Earth (p.
1040, a. 29). When they try to define Sun, they are forced to use
phrases which are applicable to many in common; but Sun, (and each Idea)
 is particular and individual, like Kleon or Sokrates. Why does none of
them produce a definition of an Idea? If any one tried, he would soon
see the pertinence of the above remarks (b. 3). (Alexander, Bonitz, and
Schwegler, all observe incidentally that the reasoning of what
immediately precedes is weak and sophistical. Bonitz, p. 352, gives a
good summary of the chapter, concluding: “Hoc capite non id ipsum
demonstrat, res singulas non esse substantias, sed rerum singularum non
esse definitionem neque scientiam; nimirum quum substantiæ vel unice vel
 potissimum esse definitionem demonstratum sit, c. 4, hoc si comprobat,
illud simul est comprobatum.”)</p>
<p>
It is farther evident that many apparent Essences are not strictly and
truly Essences; for example, the parts of animals; since not one of them
 is separated from the whole (&#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#949;&#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957; — p.

 &#7970; &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#966;’ &#959;&#8023; &#964;&#8056; &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#945;&#953;· &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962;
 &#7969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;, &#7936;&#966;’ &#7975;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#959;&#965; &#8087; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;
&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;). When any one of them is separated, it exists only in the
character of Matter — earth, fire, air; none of them, in this separate
condition, being an unity, but only like a heap of grains of gold or tin
 before they are melted and combined into one. We might suppose, indeed,
 that the parts of the body, and the parts of the soul, of animated
beings, come near to Essence, both one and the other, alike potentially
and actually (b. 12), because they have principles of motion in their
turnings (&#954;&#945;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;), so that in some cases they continue separately alive
 after division. Still the functions of the part alone must be really
regarded as nothing more than potential, wherever the oneness and
continuity of the whole is the work of Nature (b. 15), and not a mere
case of contact or forcible conjunction.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless the being One, or Unity (p. 1040, b. 16), is not itself the
 Essence of things. Unum is predicated in the same manner as Ens; the
two may always be predicated together: the Essence of Unum is One; and
things of which the Essence is Unum Numero, are themselves numerically
one. Neither Unum nor Ens is the Essence of things any more than the
being an Element, or the being a Principle, can be the Essence thereof:
we have farther to enquire what the Principle is, in order to bring the
problem into a more cognizable shape (b. 20). Unum and Ens are more near
 to Essence than either Element, Principle, or Cause; nevertheless
neither Unum nor Ens is Essence; for nothing which is common to many
things is Essence. Essence belongs only to itself and to that which has
itself. Farther, Unum cannot be in many places at once; but that which
is common is in many places at once. It is thus plain that nothing
Universal exists apart or separate from particulars (b. 27).</p>
<p>
The advocates of the (Platonic) Ideas are right in affirming them to be
separate, if they be Essences; but they are wrong in calling that which
is predicable of many things (the Universal) an Idea (p. 1040, b. 29).
When asked, What are these indestructible Essences of which you speak,
as apart from the visible individual objects? — they had no intelligible
 answer to give. Accordingly they were forced to make these Essences <span class="pagenum"><a name="page608" id="page608"></a>608</span>the same specifically with the destructible (individual) objects; for <i>these</i>
 we do know (b. 33). They simply prefixed the word &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972; to the names of
sensible objects — &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#912;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;. But these Ideas might still
exist, even though we knew not what they were; just as eternal Essences
like the stars would still exist, even though we had never seen them (p.
 1041, a. 2).</p>
<p>
Let us again examine what we call Essence, and what sort of thing it is;
 and let us take another point of departure, which may perhaps help us
to understand what that Essence is which is apart and separate from
perceivable Essences (p. 1041, a. 9). We know that Essence is a certain
variety of Principle or Cause; and from this premiss we will reason (a.
10). Now the enquiry into Cause, or the Why, always comes in this shape:
 Why does one thing belong to another? The enquiry, Why a thing is
itself? is idle. The fact — the &#8005;&#964;&#953; — must be assumed to be clear and
known in the first instance. You know that the moon is eclipsed, as
matter of fact; you proceed to enquire into the cause thereof (a.
11-24). Why does it thunder? or, to enunciate the same question more
fully, Why is there noise in the clouds? The <i>quæsitum</i> is always
one thing predicated of another (a. 26). Why are these materials, bricks
 and stones, a house? Here the answer sought is, the Cause; and that is
the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., speaking in logical or analytical phraseology (<span class="gesp">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span> — <i>i.e.</i>, that which belongs to the <span class="gesp">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962;). In some cases, this <i>quæsitum</i>
 is a Final Cause, as in the case of a bed or a house; in others, an
Efficient or Movent Cause; for that also is a variety of Cause,
generally sought for in regard to things generated or destroyed; but the
 other (viz., &#964;&#8056; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., “ipsa rei forma ac notio, aut concepta in animo
 artificis, aut inclusa &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; in ipsâ naturâ ac semine rei” — Bonitz,
Comm. p. 359) is sought for in regard to &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;.</p>
<p>
The true nature of the <i>quæsitum</i> is often unperceived, when the
problem is announced without stating distinctly the subject and
predicate in their mutual relations (&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;,
p. 1041, a. 33). For example, &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;; is ambiguous by
imperfect enunciation. As it stands, it might be supposed to be intended
 as &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;; which would be a question idle or
null. To make it clear, you ought to distinguish the two members to
which the real <i>quæsitum</i> refers (b. 2), and say &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943; &#964;&#940;&#948;&#949; &#7970; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949;
 &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;; your real enquiry is about the &#8021;&#955;&#951; or Matter, why it
exists in this or that manner. Why are these materials a house? Because
the Essence of a house belongs to them (b. 6). Some &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., some sort of
 &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, must belong to the Matter (b. 4). Why is this Matter a man? or
why is the body disposed in this particular way a man? Here we enquire
as to the Cause which acts upon a certain Matter; and that is the Form
whereby the thing is; which again is the Essence (b. 8).</p>
<p>
Hence it is plain that a distinction must be taken between the Simple
and the Compound. The enquiry above described, and the teaching above
described, cannot apply to the Simple, which must be investigated in
another way (p. 1041, b. 9). Compounds are of two sorts — aggregates
like a <i>heap</i> (mechanical), and aggregates like a <i>syllable</i>
(organic or formal). In these last there are not merely the constituent
elements, but something else besides (b. 16). The syllable <i>ba</i> is something more than the letters <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>; flesh is something more than fire and earth, its constituent elements. Now this <i>something more</i>
 cannot be itself a constituent element; for, if that were so, flesh
would be composed of three constituent elements instead of two, and we
should still have to search for the <i>something beyond</i>, and this ulterior process might be repeated <i>ad infinitum</i> (b. 22). Nor can the <i>something beyond</i>
 be itself a compound of several elements, for we should still have to
find the independent something which binds these into a compound. It is
plain that this <i>something beyond</i> must be in its nature quite
distinct from an element, and must be the cause why one compound is
flesh, another compound a syllable, and so about all the remaining
compounds. Now this is the Essence of each compound — the First Cause of
 existence to each (b. 25). The Element (&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;) is that into which
the compound is separated, as included Matter (&#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957;): <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>, in the syllable <i>ba</i>
 (b. 32). There are some things which are not the Essences of objects
(white, for example, is not of the Essence of man, but an attribute);
but, in all cases where compounds have come together according to Nature
 and by natural process, that Nature also which is not Element but
Principle is the Essence (b. 28: &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#948;’ &#7956;&#957;&#953;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;,

135, proposes to correct this passage by striking out &#954;&#945;&#943; before the
words &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8052; &#7969; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;. But, if this were done, it would make the
passage mean that &#8021;&#955;&#951; or &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; is not &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, and that the other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id="page609"></a>609</span>&#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;
 which is not &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, is to be regarded exclusively as &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;. Now
this is certainly not the doctrine of Aristotle, who expressly declares
&#8021;&#955;&#951; to be &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;; see <span class="smcap">H</span>, p. 1042, a. 32. Retaining the &#954;&#945;&#943;, the passage will then mean that not merely &#8021;&#955;&#951;, but <i>also</i> &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; which is not &#8021;&#955;&#951;, is &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;).</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Book &#919;.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>In this Book, Aristotle begins by recapitulating the doctrines and
discussions of the preceding. His purpose had been declared to be the
investigation of the Causes, Principles, and Elements of Essences. Now
Essences are diverse: some universally admitted, as the natural elements
 and simple bodies, also plants, animals, and the parts of each, lastly,
 the heaven and the parts thereof; others not universally admitted, but
advocated by some philosophers, as the Ideas and Mathematical Entia;
others, again, which we arrive at by dialectical discussion, as &#964;&#8056;
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;., the Substratum (Logical Entia — &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;, p. 1042, a. 12),
the Genus more Essence than the Species, the Universal more Essence than
 Particulars. The (Platonic) Ideas make a near approach to the Genus and
 the Universal; they are vindicated as Essences upon similar grounds.
Next, since &#964;&#8056; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. is Essence, and since the Definition is the
rational explanation of &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., we found it necessary to discuss
Definition; and, since the Definition is a sentence having parts, we
were called upon to examine these parts, and to explain what parts
belonged both to Essence and to Definition. We decided farther, after
discussion, that the Universal and the Genus were not Essence; the
Platonic Ideas and the Mathematical Entia we postponed for the moment,
and we confined ourselves to the perceivable Essences, recognized by all
 (a. 25).</p>
<p>
Now all these perceivable Essentiæ include Matter. The Substratum —
Matter in one way — is Essence; while, in another way, the Form and the
&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; is Essence; and finally the Compound of the two is Essence. Matter
 is Hoc Aliquid, not &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115; but only &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;. Form is an Hoc Aliquid
separable by reason (&#964;&#8183; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;, p. 1042, a. 29). The Compound of
the two, the complete Hoc Aliquid, is capable of existing separably, in
an absolute sense (which is true also of some Forms), and is liable
alone to generation and destruction (a. 30).</p>
<p>
It is clear that Matter also, not less than Form, is Essence; for in all
 changes from opposite to opposite, there is a certain substratum to
such changes. Thus, in changes of Place, there is a substratum which is
now here, presently there; in changes of Quantity, what is now of such
and such a size, is presently greater or less; in changes of Quality,
what is now healthy is presently sick; in changes of Essence, what is
now in course of generation is presently in course of destruction, or
what is now the substratum of some given Form (and is thus Hoc Aliquid)
is presently the substratum of Privation, and thus no longer Hoc
Aliquid. Among these four varieties of change (&#954;&#945;&#964;’ &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;,
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957;) the three last are consequent upon the first,
but the first is not consequent upon all the three last; for we cannot
maintain that, because a thing has Matter capable of local movement, it
must therefore have generable and destructible Matter (p. 1042, b. 6).</p>
<p>
Having discussed the Essence of perceivable things so far forth as <i>potential</i>, we now proceed to the same Essence so far forth as <i>actual</i>
 (&#7969; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; — &#7969; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957; — p. 1042, b. 10).
What is this last? Demokritus recognizes a primordial body one and the
same as to Matter, but having three differences — in figure, in
position, in arrangement. But it is plain that this enumeration is not
sufficient and that there are many other differences, to each of which
corresponds a special acceptation of &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; (&#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; —
b. 26). Some differences depend upon the mode of putting together
constituent materials (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#962; — b. 16), as mixture, tying,
gluing, pegging, &amp;c.; some upon position, as threshold, coping,
&amp;c.; some upon time; some upon place; some upon affections of
perceivable things, such as hardness, softness, dryness, moisture,
density, rarity, &amp;c.; some upon combinations of the foregoing; some
again simply upon excess or defect in quantity. To one or other of
these, &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; has reference in each particular case. We say — This <i>is</i> a threshold, because it lies in a particular manner: <i>Is</i> (or <i>To be</i>
 — &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;) signifies in this case that particular manner of lying. To
be ice, is to have become solidified in this particular manner (b. 28).
We must therefore look for the summa genera of the differences; in some
cases &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; will be defined by all these differences: thus more or
less dense, more or less rare, belong to the genus excess and defect;
differences of figure, smoothness, roughness, &amp;c., belong to the
genus straight and curve; in other cases, to be, or not to be, will
depend upon mixture, as the genus (p. 1043, a. 1).</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610"></a>610</span>
<p>
If then the Essence is the cause why each thing is what it is, we must
seek in these differences the cause why each thing is what it is (p.
1043, a. 3). None of these differences indeed is itself Essence, — not
even when it is embodied or combined with Matter; but it is in each the
analogue of Essence, and must be employed in defining, just as in real
and true Essence we define by predicating of Matter the Actuality or
Formality (&#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8052; &#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;
 — a. 6). Thus, if we define a threshold, we say — a piece of wood or
stone lying in this particular way; if we define ice, we say — water
frozen or solidified in this particular way, &amp;c. The Form or
Actuality of one Matter is different from that of another; so also is
the rational explanation or Definition; in some cases it is composition,
 in others mixture, &amp;c., and so forth. If any one defines a house by
 saying that it is stone or brick, he indicates only the potential
house, for these are the Matter (a. 15); if he defines it — a vessel
protecting bodies or property, he then assigns the Actuality
(&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;); if he includes both of the above in his definition, he then
 gives the third Essence completed out of the two together (&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#957;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957; — a. 18). To define from the differences, is to
 define from the side of the Actuality or Form; to define from the
included elements (&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;) is to define from the side of
the Matter (a. 20).</p>
<p>
We see herefrom what perceivable Essence is, and how it is: partly, of
the nature of Matter; partly, of Form and Actuality or Energy: again,
the third or Concrete, out of both combined (p. 1043, a. 28). Sometimes,
 it is not clear whether the name signifies this third Concrete, or the
Form and Energy. Thus, when you say a house, do you mean a protective
receptacle built of bricks? or do you mean simply a protective
receptacle — the Form simply, without specifying the Matter? When you
say a line, do you mean a dyad in length — Form in Matter? or simply a
dyad — Form alone? When you talk of an animal, do you mean soul in body?
 or simply soul, which is the Essence and Actuality of a certain body?
The word animal may be applied to both, not indeed univocally, as
implying generic resemblance, but (quasi-univocally, or semi-univocally)
 by analogical relationship to a common term (&#959;&#8016;&#967; &#8033;&#962; &#7953;&#957;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;,
 &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#8033;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7955;&#957; — a. 36). This distinction however, though important in
 some respects, is unimportant so far as regards the investigation about
 perceivable Essence; for the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. belongs to the Form and the
Actuality (a. 38). Soul, and the being soul, are identical; but man, and
 the being man, are not identical; unless the soul be called man. Thus
this identity exists in some cases, but not in others (b. 4). A syllable
 is not composed merely of letters and synthesis, nor is a house simply
of bricks and synthesis; for the synthesis or the mixture does not
proceed out of the elements which are put together or mixed (b. 8). The
like is true in other cases; <i>e.g.</i>, if the threshold is a
threshold by position, the position does not proceed out of the
threshold, but rather the threshold out of the position. Nor again is
man simply animal and biped. If these two are the Matter, there must be
something apart from and beyond them, something not itself an element
nor proceeding out of an element — the Essence; which is indicated by
abstracting from the Matter (b. 13). This, as being the Cause of
Existence and of Essence (&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; — b. 14) is
what is meant when Essence is spoken of.</p>
<p>
This Essence or Form must be eternal; or at least, if destructible, it
has never been destroyed; if generable, it has never been generated. For
 we have shown already that no one either constructs or generates Form:
the Hoc Aliquid is constructed; the product of Form and Matter is
generated (p. 1043, b. 18). As yet it has not been made clear whether
the Essences of destructible things are separable or not: in some cases
at least, they certainly are not — in those cases, namely, where there
can exist nothing beyond the particular things, as a house or an
implement (b. 21). Perhaps, indeed, these are not truly Essences —
neither these particular things nor any other things which have come
together not by natural process; for we might indicate Nature alone as
the Essence in destructible things (&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#7940;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#943;&#951; &#964;&#8052;&#957;

precedes, that there is no &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; or &#966;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#940; of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;; see <span class="correction" title="amended from regular capital letter Z"><span class="smcap">Z.</span></span> p. 1033, b. 17.

<p>
Hence we see that the difficulty started by Antisthenes and others
equally unschooled (&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#953;) is not without pertinence. They say
that, as a definition is a sentence of many words, predicating something
 of something, so you cannot define <i>Quid est</i>: you can only define and inform persons <i>Quale Quid est</i>: you can <span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611"></a>611</span>only
 tell people what the definiend is like, not what it is in itself: you
can tell them that silver is like tin, but you cannot tell what silver
is. Upon this theory, definition may be given of Compound Essence,
whether perceivable or cogitable; but not of the <i>primordia</i> of
which the compound consists. The definition must predicate a something,
which is of the nature of Form, of another something, which is of the
nature of Matter (p. 1043, b. 31).</p>
<p>
If Essences are (as the Platonists say) in a certain sense Numbers, they are so in <i>this</i>
 sense; not (as these philosophers affirm) in the character of
assemblages of Monads. For the definition is a sort of number, divisible
 into indivisible units; and the number is so likewise. If you add any
thing to, or deduct any thing from, a number (let the thing added or
deducted be never so small), it will be no longer the same number; in
like manner, neither the definition nor the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;., will be the same, if
 any thing be added or subtracted (p. 1044, a. 1). Each number must have
 something which makes its component units coalesce into one number,
though the Platonic philosophers cannot tell what that something is;
either the units are a mere (uncemented) heap, or else you must say what
 is that something which makes them <i>one</i> out of many (a. 5). The
definition also is one; yet these philosophers cannot explain what makes
 it one. The units of the number and that of the definition, is to be
explained in the same way, and that of the Essence also; not as a monad
or a point, but in each case like an Entelechy and a peculiar nature
(&#959;&#8016;&#967;, &#8033;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;, &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#940;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8022;&#963;&#945; &#7970; &#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#942;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#951; — a. 9). A given number admits of no degrees, more
or less: neither does a given Essence, unless it be taken embodied in
Matter (a. 10).</p>
<p>
Respecting the Material Essence (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8017;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; — p. 1044, a.
 15), we must not forget that, if there be one and the same First Matter
 common as a principle to all Generata or Fientia, there is nevertheless
 a certain Matter special or peculiar (proximate) to each (&#8005;&#956;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#953;&#962;
 &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965; — a. 18; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#967;&#942;&#962; — Alexander). Thus the
Materia Prima of phlegm is, sweet or fat things; that of bile is, bitter
 things and such like. Perhaps these two come both from the same Matter;
 and there are several different Matters of the same product, in cases
where one Matter proceeds from another. Thus phlegm proceeds from fat
and sweet, if fat proceeds from sweet; and even from bile, if bile be
analysed into its First Matter from whence phlegm may proceed by a
different road (a. 23). One thing may proceed from another in two
different ways: either D may proceed from C, because C is its immediate
Matter, already preformed up to a certain point, and thus on the way to a
 perfectly formed state; or D may proceed from C, after the destruction
of C and the resolution of C into its Materia Prima (&#948;&#953;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#972;&#948;’ &#7952;&#954;
&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#948;&#949;, &#7970; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#8056; &#8001;&#948;&#959;&#8166; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;&#957; — a. 24).
From one and the same Matter different products may proceed, if the
moving cause be different: from the same wood there may proceed a box or
 a bed. What product shall emerge does not, however, depend only upon
the Moving Cause, but often upon the Matter also; thus a saw cannot be
made out of wool or wood. If the same product can proceed out of
different Matter, this is evidently because the Art or Moving Cause is
the same: if this last be different, and the Matter different also, the
product will of course be different (p. 1044, a. 32).</p>
<p>
When a man asks us, What is the Cause? we ought to reply, since the word
 has many senses, by specifying all the causes which can have a bearing
on the case (p. 1044, a. 34). Thus, What is the Cause of man, as Matter?
 Perhaps the katamenia. What, as Movent? Perhaps the seed. What, as
Form? The &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. What, as &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;? The End. These two last are perhaps
both the same (a. 36). Moreover we ought to make answer by specifying
the proximate causes (not the remote and ultimate). Thus, What is the
Matter of man? We must answer by specifying the proximate matter; not
fire and earth, the ultimate and elemental (b. 2).</p>
<p>
This is the only right way of proceeding in regard to Essences natural
and generable; since the Causes are many, and are what we seek to know.
But the case is different in regard to Essences natural, yet eternal.
Some of these last perhaps have no Matter at all; or at least a
different Matter, having no attribute except local movability (b. 8.
Alexander says in explanation: &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#958;&#973;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#954;&#964;&#8060; &#963;&#966;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8182;&#957;
&#7953;&#957;&#940;&#948;&#945; — &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#957; — p.
527, 20-25, Bon.).</p>
<p>
Again, in regard to circumstances which occur by Nature, but not in the
way of Essence, there is no Matter at all: the subject itself is the
Essence. Thus in regard to an eclipse: What is its Cause? What is its
Matter? There is no Matter, except the moon which is affected in a
certain way. What is the Cause, as Movent — here light-destroying? The
earth. Perhaps there is no &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id="page612"></a>612</span>in
 the case. But the Cause in the way of Form is the rational explanation
or definition; and this must include a specification of the Movent
Cause, otherwise it will be obscure. Thus, the eclipse is, privation of
light; and, when you add — by the earth intervening, you then specify
the Movent, and make your definition satisfactory (b. 15).</p>
<p>
In defining sleep we ought to say what part of the system is first
affected thereby; but this is not clear. Shall we indicate only the
animal (as substratum)? But this is not enough. We shall be asked, What
part of the animal? Which part first? The heart, or what other part?
Next, by what Cause? Lastly, how is the heart affected, apart from the
rest of the system? To say — Sleep is a certain sort of immobility, will
 not be a sufficient definition. We must specify from what primary
affection such immobility arises (p. 1044, b. 20).</p>
<p>
Since some things exist, and do not exist, without generation or
destruction (as Forms, and Points, if there be such things as Points),
it is impossible that all Contraries can be generated out of each other,
 if every generation be both <i>aliquid</i> and <i>ex aliquo</i>. <i>Albus homo ex nigro homine</i> must be generated in a different way from <i>album ex nigro</i>.
 Now Matter is only to be found in those cases where there is generation
 and change into each other; in other cases, where no change takes
place, there is no Matter. There is a difficulty in understanding how
the Matter of each substance stands in regard to the contrary
modifications of that substance (p. 1044, b. 29). If the body is
potentially healthy, and if disease is the contrary of health, are we to
 say that both these states are potential? Is water potentially both
wine and vinegar? Or are we to say rather that the body is the Matter of
 health, and that water is the Matter of wine, in the way of acquisition
 by nature and by taking on the Form to which it tends; and that the
body is the Matter of sickness, and wine the Matter of vinegar in the
way of privation and of destruction contrary to nature (b. 34)? However,
 there is here some difficulty: Since vinegar is generated out of wine,
why is not wine the Matter of vinegar, and potentially vinegar? Why is
not the living man potentially a corpse? Is it not rather the truth,
however, that these are accidental or contra-natural destructions (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;
&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#7985; &#966;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#943; — b. 36, <i>i.e.</i>, not in the regular appetency
and aspirations, according to which the destruction of one Form gives
place to a better); and that through such destruction the same Matter
which belonged to the living man becomes afterwards the Matter of the
corpse; likewise the Matter of wine becomes, through the like
destruction, Matter of vinegar — by a generation like that of night out
of day? Changes of this sort must take place by complete resolution into
 the original Materia Prima (&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; — a. 3); thus,
if a living animal comes out of a dead one, the latter is first resolved
 into its elements, and then out of them comes the living animal. So
vinegar is first resolved into water, then out of the water comes wine
(a. 5).</p>
<p>
We shall now revert to the difficulty recently noticed, about
Definitions and Numbers. What is the cause that each number and each
definition is One? In all cases where there are several parts not put
together as a mere heap, but where there is a Whole besides the parts,
there must be some cause of this kind. With some bodies, contact is such
 cause; with others, viscosity (&#947;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#967;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; — p. 1045, a. 12), or some
other affection. But the definition is one complex phrase, not by
conjunction like the Iliad, but One by being the definition of one
subject (a. 14). Now what is it which makes the subject man, One? Why is
 he One and not Many, say animal and a biped — more especially if there
exist, as the Platonists say, a Self-animal and a Self-biped? Why are
not these two &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940; the man (&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8048; &#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;; —
 a. 17), so that individuals are men by participation not of one
Self-man, but of the two — Self-animal, Self-biped? On this theory
altogether, it would seem that a man cannot be One, but must be Many —
animal and biped. It is plain that in this way of investigation the
problem is insoluble.</p>
<p>
But if, as <i>we</i> say (p. 1045, a. 23), there be on one side Matter,
on the other side Form — on one side that which is in Potency, on the
other side that which is in Act (a. 24) — the problem ceases to be
difficult. The difficulty is the same as it would be if the definition
of <i>himation</i> were, round brass: the word <i>himation</i> would be
the sign of that definition, and the problem would be, What is the Cause
 why round and brass are One? But the difficulty vanishes, when we reply
 that one is Matter, the other Form. And, in cases where generation
intervenes, what is the Cause why the potential Ens is actual Ens,
except the Efficient (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#957; — a. 31)? There is no other Cause
why the sphere in potency is a sphere in actuality: such was the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;.
of each (&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;’ &#7974;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. &#7953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#8179; — a. 33). Of Matter there are two
varieties, the Cogitable and the Perceivable; and, in the Definition, a
part is always Matter, a part is Form or Energy; as when we define <span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613"></a>613</span>the
 circle — a plane figure. (Aristotle argues:— On the Platonic theory
that Ideas or Forms are Entia, separate from particulars, self-existent,
 and independent of each other, no cause can be assigned for the
coalescence of any two or more of them into one; <i>e.g.</i> animal and
biped, into man. But upon my theory, Form and Matter, Power and Act, are
 in their own nature relative to each other. It is their own inherent
nature to coalesce into one, or for Power to pass into Act. This is the
cause of their unity: no other cause can be found or is necessary. See
Alexander, p. 531.)</p>
<p>
In those cases where there is no Matter, either cogitable or
perceivable, as in the Categories, Hoc Aliquid, Quale, Quantum, &amp;c.,
 each of them is, in itself and at once, both Ens and Unum (p. 1045, b.
2). Hence neither Ens nor Unum is included in the Definitions, and the
&#964;.&#951;.&#949;. is, in itself and at once, both Ens and Unum. No other cause can
be assigned why each of these is Ens and Unum; each of them is so, at
once and immediately; yet not as if they were all included in Ens or
Unum as common genera; nor as if they were apart and separable from
particulars (b. 7).</p>
<p>
Philosophers, who do not adopt this opinion, resort to various phrases,
all unsatisfactory, to explain the coalescence or unity of the elements
included in the Definition. Some call it &#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;, but they give no cause
 of the &#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;; others &#963;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;, or &#963;&#973;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;, or &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; — of soul
with body, as definition of life. But we might just as well use these
phrases on other occasions, and say that to be well was a synthesis of
the soul with health; that the brazen triangle was a &#963;&#973;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; of brass
with triangle; that white was a synthesis of superficies with whiteness
(p. 1045, b. 15). These phrases carry no explanation; and these
philosophers get into the difficulty by taking a wrong point of
departure. They first lay down Power as different from Entelechy, and
then look for an explanation which makes them one (&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#948;’ &#8005;&#964;&#953;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#950;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#7953;&#957;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;&#957; — p. 1045,
b. 16, Schwegler observes that the two last words are loosely put, and
that the clear words to express what Aristotle means would be: &#950;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;
&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#7953;&#957;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#953;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;&#957; — Comm. II. p. 154.). But the truth
is that Power and Entelechy are not essentially two, but only different
aspects of one and the same. The Last Matter and the Form are the same;
but the first is in potency, the second in perfect actuality (“Stoff und
 Form, Potenzielles und Actuelles, sind eins und dasselbe auf
verschiedenen Entwicklungsstufen” — Schwegler II. p. 151). To enquire in
 any particular case what is the cause of this One, is the same as to
enquire generally the cause of Unity. Each thing is a certain One; the
Potential and the Actual are One, in a certain way (b. 20). So that no
other Cause can be found except the Movent or Efficient — that which
moved the matter out of Potency into Actuality. As to those things which
 have no Matter, each of them is One immediately and <i>per se</i> (b. 23).</p>

In discriminating the meanings of Ens, we noticed one &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; (apart from Ens according to the Categories). We shall now
proceed to discuss these two terms &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; and &#7953;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945; = &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; (p.
 1045, b. 35). </p>
<p>
It is elsewhere mentioned (<span class="smcap">&#916;.</span> p. 1019) that
&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; has many senses, of which some (like the geometrical, &amp;c.)
are equivocal or metaphorical, so that we shall pass them over here (p.
1046, a. 6). But there is one first and proper sense of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;, from
which many others diverge in different directions of relationship or
analogy (a. 10). That first and proper sense is — a principle of change <i>in alio vel quatenus aliud</i>, or a principle of change <i>ab alio vel quatenus aliud</i>
 (&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#8179; &#7970; &#8087; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; — &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#8017;&#960;’ &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#7970; &#8087; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; —
a. 11, 14. The same definition is given in terms somewhat different at
p. 1048, a. 28: &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8003; &#960;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#954;&#949; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#7970; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
&#8017;&#960;’ &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965;, &#7970; &#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#7970; &#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#940;. This Aristotle calls &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;
&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; — expressed by Bonitz, Comm., p. 379: “agendi patiendive nisum
quendam.”). The notion of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; however extends more widely than this
first sense of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;. It includes other cases, as where
we say that Hermes is &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; in the wood, and that the half foot is
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; in the whole foot (p. 1048, a. 33; Bonitz distinguishes this
last sense as Möglichkeit, from the first sense as Vermögen, p. 379).</p>
<p>
We begin by speaking about the first and proper sense — &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;
&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;. One variety thereof is, when a thing has power of being
passively affected so and so — when there resides in the thing a
principle of passive change (&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; — p. 1046, a. 13)
by something else or by itself <i>quatenus</i> something else. (These
last words are added because a sick man has the &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; of being cured
either by a physician, or by himself if he be a physician; but then in
this last case <span class="pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>614</span>he
 is to be looked upon in two different characters, as physician and as
patient: he cures himself as physician, he is cured as patient.) Another
 variety of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; is, when a thing has power of resisting
 change for the worse or destruction by any exterior principle of change
 (a. 14); as hardness in iron. Sometimes this &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; is restricted to
the cases in which a person can do the thing in question well: no man is
 said to have the power of speaking or singing unless he can perform
these functions pretty well (a. 18).</p>
<p>
In all these varieties, the general notion of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; is
included (p. 1046, a. 16). The active and passive &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; are, in one
sense, one and the same; in another sense, distinct and different. For
one of them resides in the patient, the other in the agent (a. 27):
sometimes the two come by nature together in the same thing; yet the
patient does not suffer from itself as patient, but from itself as
agent. Impotence (&#7936;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#943;&#945;) is the privation contrary to this <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#948;&#973;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#953;&#962;'">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>. Privation has many different meanings (a. 32).</p>
<p>
Among these principles of change, some reside in the inanimate
substances, others in the animated; not only in the soul generally, but
also in the rational branch of the soul (p. 1046, a. 38). Accordingly
some &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; are Rational, others Irrational. All arts and constructive
 sciences are &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; (or &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#8179; &#7970; &#8087; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; — b. 3).
In the rational capacities, the same capacity covers both contraries; in
 the irrational, each bears upon one of the two contraries exclusively;
thus, fire will only heat but not chill, while the medical art will
produce either sickness or health. The reason is, that Science is based
upon rational explanations or definitions; and the same rational
explanation declares both the thing itself and the privation thereof;
though not indeed in the same manner: it declares, in a certain way,
both together, and, in a certain way, chiefly the positive side (b. 10).
 Accordingly these sciences are sciences of both the contraries at once:
 namely, <i>per se</i>, of one side of the Antiphasis; not <i>per se</i>, of the other side; since the rational explanation also declares, directly and <i>per se</i>, only one side, while it declares the other side in a certain way indirectly, mediately, <i>per accidens</i> — <i>i.e.</i>,
 by negation and exclusion (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8119;. — b. 14). For the
Contrary is the highest grade of privation; and this is the exclusion of
 one side of the alternative (&#7969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7969; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957;, &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;
&#948;’ &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8048; &#952;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965; — p. 1046 b. 15; Bonitz says that &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957; is the
subject of this proposition, and &#7969; &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; the predicate). Both of two
contraries cannot reside, indeed, in the same subject; but Science is a
&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; through rational explanation or reason in the soul which has
within it a principle of motion; accordingly the soul can bring to pass
either of the two contraries, through reference to the same rational
notion or explanation which comprises both (b. 22).</p>
<p>
The Megaric philosophers recognize no &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; apart from &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;;
affirming that no one has any power, except at the moment when he is
actually exercising it. These philosophers are wrong (for various
reasons indicated: p. 1046, b. 30 — p. 1047, a. 20). Power and Act are
distinct. A particular event is possible to happen, yet it does not
happen; or possible not to happen, yet it does happen (p, 1047, a. 22).
That is possible, to which, if the act supervene whereto such
possibility relates, nothing impossible will ensue (a. 25). The name
&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;, appended to that of &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945; (&#7969; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;
&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; — a. 30), has come to be applied to other things chiefly
from reference to motions; for motion is <i>par excellence</i> &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;.
 Hence Non-Entia are never said to be moved, though other predicates may
 be applied to them: we may call them &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#940; and &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#940;, but never
&#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;; for, if we did, we should be guilty of contradiction, saying
that things which are not &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115; are &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115;. Among the Non-Entia
there are some which are Entia &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;: we call them Non-Entia, because
they are not &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#8115; (b. 2).</p>
<p>
If the definition above given of &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957; be admitted, we see plainly
that no one can say truly: This is possible, yet it will never happen
(p. 1047, b. 3, seq.).</p>
<p>
Among all the various &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;, some are congenital, such as the
perceptive powers (&#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#957; — p. 1047, b. 31); others are acquired by
practice, such as playing the flute; others by learning, like the arts:
these two last varieties we cannot possess without having previously
exercised ourselves in them actively (b. 34), but the others, which are
more of a passive character, we may possess without such condition. This
 distinction coincides with that which was drawn previously between the
rational and the irrational &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; or capacities: the rational
capacities belonging only to a soul, and to the rational branch thereof.
 Now every &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957; has its own specialities and conditions: it is itself
 a given something, and it is surrounded with concomitants of special
time, place, neighbourhood, &amp;c. (p. 1048, a. 1). The irrational
capacities must necessarily pass into reality, whenever the active and
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>615</span>passive
 conditions come together, because there is but one reality to arise;
but the rational capacities not necessarily, because they tend to either
 one of two contrary realities, both of which cannot be produced. Which
of the two contraries shall be brought to reality, will depend upon
another authority — the appetency or deliberate resolution of the soul:
to whichsoever of the two, each possible, such sovereign appetency
tends, that one will be brought to pass, when agent and patient come
together and both are in suitable condition (a. 11); and under those
circumstances, it will <i>necessarily</i> (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; — a. 14) be brought to
 pass. We need not formally enunciate the clause — “if nothing extrinsic
 occurs to prevent it”: for this is already implied in the definition of
 &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; which is never affirmed as absolute and unconditional, but
always under certain given conditions (a. 18: &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#948;’ &#959;&#8016; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’
&#7952;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#8182;&#962;). Accordingly the agent will not be able to bring about both
 sides of the alternative at once, even though appetite or deliberate
resolution may prompt him to do it (a. 21).</p>
<p>
Having thus gone through the variety of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; called &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;,
we shall now give some explanations of &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;; in the course of which
we shall be able to illustrate by contrast, the other variety of
&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;, which was indicated above (p. 1048, a. 30). &#7960;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; is used
when the thing exists, not &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;: meaning by &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; such as Hermes in
 the wood or the half-yard in the whole yard. We shall explain our
meaning, by giving an induction of particulars; for definition cannot be
 given of every thing. We must group into one view the analogies
following (&#959;&#8016; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#8005;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#950;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#961;&#8118;&#957; — a.
37): As the person now actually building is to the professional builder
not so engaged; as the animal awake is to the animal asleep; as the
animal seeing is to the animal possessed of good eyes but having them
closed; as that which is severed from matter is to matter (&#964;&#8056;
&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; — b. 3); as the work completed is to the material yet
unworked; — so is &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; to &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;. The antithesis is not similar in
all these pairs of instances, but there is a relationship or analogy
pervading all (&#8033;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179; &#7970; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;, &#964;&#972;&#948;’ &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183;&#948;&#949; &#7970; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; —
 b. 8). In some of the pairs, the antithesis is the same as that of
&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957;; in others, it is the same as that of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;
&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; (b. 9). In one member of each pair, we have &#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;
&#7936;&#966;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;; in the other &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957; (b. 5 — &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; here is <i>reality severed and determinate</i>, as contrasted with &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; <i>potentiality huddled together and indeterminate</i>.
 — See Schwegler’s note: “Potenzialität und Aktualität sind reine
Verhältnissbegriffe” — p. 172, seq.). But in all the above-named
examples, that which is now &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; may come actually to be &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115;:
the person now sleeping may awake; the person whose eyes are now closed
may open them and see; the Hermes now in the wood may be brought out of
the wood and exist as a real statue. It is otherwise with The Infinite,
Vacuum, &amp;c. These exist &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; only, and can never come to exist
&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115;, or independently. The Infinite can exist &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115; only for our
 cognition. The fact that the bisection thereof is never exhausted —
that we may go on dividing as long as we choose — gives to the potential
 Infinite a certain actuality, though it cannot be truly separated (b.
16).</p>
<p>
We must farther explain in what cases it is proper to say that a thing
is &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, and in what cases it is not proper. You cannot properly say
that earth is potentially a man: you may perhaps say that the semen is
potentially a man; yet even <i>this</i> not certainly, since other
conditions besides semen are required (p. 1049, a. 2). The physician
cannot cure every patient, yet neither is the cure altogether a matter
of chance (&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#962; — a. 4): there is a certain measure of cure
possible, and that is called &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;. The definition
thereof, taken from the side of the agent, would be — that which will
come to pass if he wills it, without any impediment from without; from
the side of the patient — when no impediment occurs from within him (a.
8). In like manner, a house exists &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, when all the matter for it
is brought together, without need either of addition or subtraction or
change, and when there is no internal impediment; and so with other
products of art, where the principle of generation is extrinsic to
themselves. In natural products, where the principle of generation is
intrinsic, we treat them as potentially existing, when this principle is
 in a condition to realize itself through itself, assuming no external
impediments to interfere. Thus we do not call the semen potentially a
man, because, before it becomes such, it must undergo change in
something else, and therefore stands in need of some other principle; we
 call it so only when it is in such conditions that its own principle
suffices. Earth is not said to be a statue &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, until it has first
been changed into brass (a. 17). We call the product not by the name of
the Matter itself, but by an adjective appellation derived from the next
 adjacent Matter; thus we call a box, not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>616</span>wood,
 but wooden: wood is then a box &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;. But we say this only of the
proximate or immediate Matter, not of the remote or primary Matter. We
must go back through successive stages to the first or most remote
Matter; thus wood is not earth, but earthy: earth therefore is
potentially wood. The earth may be aeriform; the air may be fiery; the
fire has no analogous adjective whereby it can be called, and is thus
the first or last Matter. But it is not said to be potentially any thing
 except the &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957; combined with Form immediately above it. Matter may
 be either proximate or remote: Potentiality is affirmed only of the
proximate Matter.</p>
<p>
Since all the different meanings of Prius have been enumerated and
distinguished, it is plain that in all those meanings Actuality is <i>prius</i>
 as compared with Potentiality: whether the &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; be &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; (
 = &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;) &#7952;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#8179; &#8087; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;, like Art; or &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7970; &#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7952;&#957;
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#8087; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;, like Nature (p. 1049, b. 5-10). Actuality is <i>prius</i> both &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; and &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#8115;: it is also <i>prius</i> &#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#8179; in a certain sense, though not in a certain other sense.</p>
<p>
It is <i>prius</i> &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;, because the Actual is included in the
definition of the Potential; that is, it must be presupposed and
foreknown, before you can understand what the Potential is (p. 1049, b.
17). You explain &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; or &#8001;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; by saying that he is &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;
&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7970; &#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#957;: you explain &#8001;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957; by saying that it is &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957;
&#8001;&#961;&#8118;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;: &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;, in its first and absolute meaning, is &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;
because it may come into Actuality (b. 13).</p>
<p>
It is <i>prius</i> &#967;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8183; in the sense that the Potential always presupposes an Actual identical <i>specie</i>, though not identical <i>numero</i>,
 with that Actual to which the Potential tends. Take a man now existing
and now seeing, or corn now ripe in the field: these doubtless, before
they came into their present condition, must have pre-existed in
Potentiality; that is, there must have pre-existed a certain matter —
seed or a something capable of vision — which at one time was not yet in
 a state of Actuality (p. 1049, b. 23). But prior to this matter there
must have existed other Actualities, by which this matter was generated:
 the Actual is always generated out of its Potential by a prior Actual, <i>e.g.</i>,
 a man by a man, a musical man by a musical man; there being always some
 prior movent, which must be itself already in Actuality (b. 27). We
have already declared that every thing generated is something generated
out of something, and by something which is identical in species with
the thing generated (b. 29). Hence it seems that there can be no builder
 who has built nothing, no harper who has never harped; for the man who
is learning to harp learns by harping (b. 32); which gave occasion to
the sophistical puzzle — That one, who does not possess the knowledge,
will nevertheless do that to which the knowledge relates. The learner
does not possess the knowledge; yet still he must have possessed some
fragments of the knowledge: just as, in every thing which is in course
of generation, some fraction must have been already generated; in every
thing which is moved, some fraction has been already moved (b. 36).</p>
<p>
Lastly, Actuality is <i>prius</i> as compared with Potentiality (not
merely &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#8179; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8037;&#962;, but also) &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#8115; (p. 1050, a. 4). In the
 first place, that which is latest in generation is first in Form and in
 Essence; a man compared with a child, man as compared with semen. Man
already possesses the Form, semen does not. Next, every thing generated
marches or gradually progresses towards its principle and towards its
end. The principle is the &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;, and the generation is for the sake
of the end. Now the end or consummation is Actuality, and for the sake
of this the Potentiality is taken on (&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; — a. 10). Animals do
not see in order that they may have sight; they have sight in order that
 they may see: they do not theorize in order that they may possess
theoretical aptitude, but the converse; except indeed those who are
practising as learners. Moreover, Matter is said to exist potentially,
because it may come into Form; but, when it exists actually, it is then
in Form (a. 16). (Alexander says: &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#7938;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; (&#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;) &#8033;&#962;
 <span class="gesp">&#7952;&#966;&#949;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#959;&#957;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#962; — p. 559, 10, Bon.) The case is the same where the end is
nothing beyond a particular mode of motion (<i>e.g.</i>, dancing): the
dancing-master has attained his end when he exhibits his pupil actually
dancing. In natural productions this is no less true than in artificial:
 Nature has attained her end, when the product comes into &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;; that
 is, when it is actually at work, from whence the name &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; is
derived (&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;, &#7969; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957; — &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;
 &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; — a. 23).</p>
<p>
In some cases (as we have often remarked) the ultimatum is use, without any ulterior product distinct from the use, <i>e.g.</i>,
 the act of seeing is the ultimatum of the visual power (p. 1050, a.
24); in other cases there is something ulterior and distinct as a house
from the building power. In the former of these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617"></a>617</span>cases,
 Actuality is the end of &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;; in the latter it is more the end than
&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;. (&#8013;&#956;&#969;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#957;&#952;&#945; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7956;&#957;&#952;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#974;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;· &#7969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7941;&#956;&#945; &#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8135; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#8115; — a. 29. This passage is obscure: see the comments of
Alexander, with the notes of Schwegler and Bonitz, who accuse Alexander
of misunderstanding it; though it appears to me that neither of them is
quite clear. I understand Aristotle to reason as follows:— &#8013;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; is the
 &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;, the &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;, the consummation of the visual power called &#8004;&#968;&#953;&#962;;
but &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, is not the &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;, the &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;, the consummation of the
 building power called &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#942;. This last has its &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;,
consummation, in the ulterior product &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#945;. Nevertheless &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
residing as it does &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;, and coming into existence
simultaneously with the house, is more the end, more akin to the end or
consummation than the building power called &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#942;.)</p>
<p>
In cases where there is an ulterior product beyond and apart from the
exercise of the power, the Actuality (consummation) resides in that
product (p. 1050, a. 31). In cases where is no such ulterior product,
the Actuality resides in the same subject wherein the power resides.
Thus sight resides in him who sees, and life in the soul. Hence also
happiness resides in the soul; for happiness is a certain kind of life
(b. 1).</p>
<p>
It is thus plain that Actuality is the Essence and the Form, and that it is <i>prius</i>
 &#964;&#8135; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#8115; compared with Potentiality. And, as has been already remarked,
 one Actuality always precedes another, in time, up to the eternal Prime
 Movent (p. 1050, b. 5). Moreover, &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; is <i>prius</i> to &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; in respect to speciality and dignity (&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#962; — b. 6). For eternal things are <i>priora</i> in essence to destructible things, and nothing is eternal &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, as the reason of the case will show us (b. 8).</p>
<p>
All Potentiality applies at once to both sides of the Antiphasis — to
the affirmative as well as to the negative. That which is not possible,
will never occur to any thing; but every thing which is possible may
never come to Actuality (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8052; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957; — p.
1050, b. 10). That which is possible to be, is also possible not to be.
Now that which is possible not to be, may perhaps not be (&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8052;
&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; — b. 13); but that which may not be, is destructible, either
absolutely (that is, in respect to Essence), or in respect to such
portions of its nature as may not be, that is, in respect to locality or
 quantity or quality. Accordingly, of those things which are absolutely,
 or in respect to Essence, indestructible, nothing exists &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;
absolutely or in respect to Essence, though it may exist &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; in
certain respects, as in respect to quality or locality); all of them
exist &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115; (b. 18). Nor does any thing exist &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, which exists
by necessity; yet the things which exist by necessity are first of all (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>priora</i>
 in regard to every thing else); for, if they did not exist, nothing
would have existed. Moreover, if there be any Eternal Motion, or any
Eternal Motum, it cannot be Motum &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; except in respect to whence
and whither; in that special respect, it may have Matter or Potentiality
 (b. 21).</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the Sun, the Stars, and the whole Heaven, are always at
work, and there is no danger of their ever standing still, which some
physical philosophers fear (&#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150; &#8001; &#7973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962; — p. 1050, b. 22); nor
are they fatigued in doing this. Motion with them is not a potentiality
of both members of the Antiphasis, either to be moved or not to be
moved. If the fact were so — if their Essence were Matter and Power, and
 not Act — the perpetual continuity of (one side of the alternative)
motion would be toilsome to them; but it is not toilsome, since
Actuality is their very Essence (b. 28). Likewise mutable things (which
are destructible), such as earth and fire, imitate these indestructible
entities, being ever at work; for these elements possess motion by
themselves and in themselves, each changing into another (b. 30; compare
 De Gen. et Corr. p. 337, a. 2). But the other &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; are all
potentialities of both sides of the Antiphasis, or of both alternatives.
 The rational &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; can cause motion in such and such way, or not in
such and such way; the irrational &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; may be present or absent, and
 thus embrace both sides of the alternative (b. 33).</p>
<p>
Hence we draw another argument for not admitting the Platonic doctrine
of Ideas, affirmed by the dialecticians (&#959;&#7985; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; — p. 1050, b.
 35). If there existed such Ideas, they would be only <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#962;'">&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>
 in respect to the &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; existing in their particular embodiments.
Thus an individual cognizing man would be much more cognizant than
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;; a particular substance in motion would be much more in
motion than &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; or &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; itself. For &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; or
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; are only &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962; to the &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#956;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953; or the &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953;,
which belong to &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; (b. 36). (We may remark that in the Platonic
Parmenides, p. 134, C., an argument the very opposite to this is urged.
It is there contended that Cognitio <i>per se</i> (the Idea) must be far more <span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618"></a>618</span>complete and accurate than any cognition which <i>we</i> possess.)</p>
<p>
It is thus plain that &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; is <i>prius</i> to &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;, and to every
principle of change (p. 1051, a. 2). It is also better and more
honourable than &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; even in the direction of good. We have already
observed that &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; always includes both of two contraries, in the way
 of alternative: one of these must be the good, the other the bad. Now
the actuality of good is better than the potentiality of good; the
actuality of health is better than the potentiality of health, which
latter must also include the potentiality of sickness, while the
actuality of health excludes the actuality of sickness. On the other
hand, the actuality of evil is worse than the potentiality of evil; for
the potentiality is neither of the two contraries or both of them at
once (a. 17). Hence we see that evil is nothing apart from particular
things; since it is posterior in its nature even to Potentiality: there
is therefore neither evil, nor error, nor destruction, in any of the
principia or eternal Essences (a. 19). (The note of Bonitz here is
just:— “Quem in hac argumentatione significavi errorem — judicium morale
 de bono et malo immisceri falso iis rebus, a quibus illud est alienum —
 ei non dissimilem Arist. in proximâ argumentatione, si recte ejus
sententiam intelligo, videtur admisisse, quum quidem malum non esse &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048;
 &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, seorsim ac per se existens, demonstrare conatur.”
Aristotle here as elsewhere confounds the idea of Good, Perfection,
Completeness, &amp;c., with that of essential Priority. But what he says
 here — &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; — can hardly be reconciled
with what he says in the Physica (pp. 189, 191, 192) about &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
which he includes among the three &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;, and which he declares to be
&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#962; — p. 192, a. 15.)</p>
<p>
Lastly, we discover geometrical truths by drawing visible diagrams, and
thus translating the Potentialities into Actuality. If these diagrams
were ready drawn for us by nature, there would be no difficulty in
seeing these truths; but, as the case stands, the truths only inhere in
the figures potentially (p. 1051, a. 23: &#949;&#7984; &#948;’ &#7974;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#8131;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#941;&#957;&#945;, &#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#8048; &#7938;&#957;
&#7974;&#957;· &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#948;’ &#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;). If the triangle had a line ready drawn
parallel to its side, we should have seen at once that its three angles
were equal to two right angles. Potential truths are thus discovered by
being translated into Actuality. The reason of this is, that the
Actuality is itself an act of cogitation, so that the Potentiality
springs from Actuality (&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#948;’ &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;· &#8037;&#963;&#964;’ &#7952;&#958;
&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#7969; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; — a. 30. It is not therefore true — what the
Platonists say — that the mathematical bodies and their properties are
&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;: they are only &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;, and they are brought into
being by our cogitation or abstraction). It is true that each individual
 diagram drawn is posterior to the power of drawing it (a. 32).</p>
<p>
Having gone through the discussion of Ens according to the first of the
ten Categories, and of Ens Potential and Actual, we have now to say
something about Ens as True or False in the strictest sense of the words
 (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#8002;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8050;&#962; &#7970; &#968;&#949;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962; — p. 1051, b. 1). These words mean,
 in reference to things, either that they are conjoined or that they are
 disjoined. To speak truth is to affirm that things which are disjoined
or conjoined in fact, are disjoined or conjoined; to speak falsely, the
reverse. The appeal is to the fact: it is not because we truly call you
white, that you are white; it is because you really are white, that we
who call you white speak truth (b. 9). If there are some things which
are always conjoined, others always disjoined, others again sometimes
conjoined sometimes disjoined, propositions in reference to the first
two classes affirming conjunction or disjunction, will be always true or
 always false, while in reference to the third class propositions may be
 either true or false, according to the case (b. 10).</p>
<p>
But what shall we say in regard to things Uncompounded? In respect to
them, what is truth or falsehood — to be or not to be? (&#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#945; — p.
 1051, b. 18). If we affirm white of the wood, or incommensurability of
the diagonal, such conjunction of predicate and subject may be true or
false; but how, if there be no predicate distinct from the subject?
Where there is no distinction between predicate and subject, where the
subject stands alone, — in these cases, there is no truth or falsehood
in the sense explained above: no other truth except that the mind
apprehends and names the subject, or fails to do so. You either know the
 subject, or you do not know it: there is no alternative but that of
knowledge or ignorance; to be deceived is impossible about the question <i>Quid est</i>
 (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#952;&#953;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962;, &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#964;&#8056;
&#948;’ &#7936;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#956;&#8052; &#952;&#953;&#947;&#947;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;· &#7936;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7970;
 &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; — b. 25. The last words are thus explained by Bonitz:
“nisi forte per abusum quendam vocabuli ipsam ignorantiam dixeris
errorem” — p. 411.). All these uncompounded subjects exist actually, not
 potentially: if the latter had been true, they would have been
generated and destroyed; but Ens Ipsum (&#964;&#8056; &#8002;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972; — b. 29) is neither <span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619"></a>619</span>generated
 nor destroyed; for, if it had been, it must have been generated out of
something. Respecting all those things which exist in Essence and
Actuality, you cannot be deceived: you may apprehend them in cogitation,
 or fail to apprehend them. The essential question respecting them is,
whether they exist in such or such manner or not; as it is respecting
the One and the Uncompounded — whether, being an existent, it exists
thus and thus or not (b. 35). Truth consists in apprehending or
cogitating them (p. 1052, a. 1): the contrary thereof is
non-apprehension of them or ignorance (&#7940;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;), yet not analogous to
blindness; for that would be equivalent to having no apprehensive
intelligence (&#8033;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7984; &#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#8005;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#956;&#8052; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#953;&#962; — a. 3; one is not
absolutely without &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, but one’s &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; does not suffice for
apprehending these particular objects).</p>
<p>
Respecting objects immoveable and unchangeable, and apprehended as such,
 it is plain that there can be no mistake as to the When (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#972; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#941; —
 p. 1052, a. 5; <i>i.e.</i>, a proposition which is true of them at one
time cannot be false at another time). No man will suppose a triangle to
 have its three angles equal to two right angles at one time, but not at
 another. Even in these unchangeables, indeed, a man may mistake as to
the What: he may suppose that there is no even number which is a prime
number, or he may suppose that there are some even numbers which are
prime, others which are not so; but, respecting any particular number,
he will never suppose it to be sometimes prime, sometimes not prime (a.
10).</p>
<p>
(In respect to the meaning of &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#945; — p. 1051, b. 17 — Bonitz and
Schwegler differ. Bonitz says, Comm. p. 409: “Compositæ quas dicit non
sunt intelligendæ eæ quæ ex pluribus elementis coaluerunt, sed eæ
potius, in quibus cum substantia conjungitur accidens aliquod, veluti
homo albus, homo sedens, diagonalis irrationalis, et similia.” Schwegler
 says, p. 187: “Unter den &#956;&#8052; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953; versteht Arist. näher
diejenigen Substanzen, die nicht ein &#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957; oder &#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; sondern &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965;
&#8021;&#955;&#951;&#962; (&#959;&#8016; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;) und schlechthin &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115;, also reine Formen sind, und
als solche kein Werden und Vergehen haben.” Of these two different
explanations, I think that the explanation given by Bonitz is the more
correct, or at least the more probable.)</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>We have to speculate respecting Essence; for that which we are in
search of is the principles and causes of Essences (p. 1069, a. 18). If
we look upon the universe as one whole, Essence is the first part
thereof: if we look upon it as a series of distinct units (&#949;&#7984; &#964;&#8183; &#7952;&#966;&#949;&#958;&#8134;&#962;,
 a. 20), even in that view &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; stands first, &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957; next, &#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957; third;
indeed these last are not Entia at all, strictly speaking (a. 21) — I
mean, for example, qualities and movements, and negative attributes such
 as not-white and not-straight; though we do talk of these last too as
Entia, when we say <i>Est non-album</i>. Moreover Essence alone, and
none of the other Categories, is separable. The old philosophers (&#959;&#7985;
&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;) are in the main concurrent with us on this point, that Essence
is <i>prius</i> to all others; for they investigated the principles, the
 elements, and the causes of Essence. The philosophers of the present
day (Plato, &amp;c.) declare Universals, rather than Particulars, to be
Essences; for the genera are universal, which these philosophers, from
devoting themselves to dialectical discussions, affirm to be more
properly considered as Principles and Essences (a. 28); but the old
philosophers considered particular things to be Essences, as fire and
earth, for example, not the common body or Body in general (&#959;&#8016; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957;
 &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; — a. 30).</p>
<p>
Now there are three Essences. The Perceivable includes two varieties: one, the Perishable, acknowledged by all, <i>e.g.</i>,
 animals and plants; the other Eternal, of which we must determine the
elements, be they many or one. There is also the Immoveable, which some
consider to be separable (&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951; &#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#8050;&#962; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;
&#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#957; — p. 1069, a. 33; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; — Schwegler’s note):
 either recognizing two varieties thereof, distinct from each other —
the Forms and Mathematical Entia; or not recognizing Forms as separable
Entia, but only the Mathematical Entia (a. 36). Now the first, or
Perceivable Essences, belong to physical science, since they are
moveable or endued with motion; the Immoveable Essences, whether there
be two varieties of them or only one, belong to a science distinct from
physical. The Perceivable and the Immoveable Essences have no common
principles (b. 2).</p>
<p>
The Perceivable Essence is subject to change (&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#942;). Since change
takes place either out of Opposites or out of Intermediates, and not out
 of every variety of Opposites, but only out of Contraries (&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, &#7952;&#954; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620"></a>620</span>&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; — Alexander, pp. 644, 645, Bon.; the voice, <i>e.g.</i>,
 is not white, yet change does not take place from voice to white, these
 being disparates, or of different genera: &#964;&#8048; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;
&#8001;&#948;&#8056;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#945; — I. iv. p. 1055, a. 6), there must of necessity be a
certain Substratum which changes into the contrary condition; for
contraries do not change into each other. The substratum remains, but
the contraries do not remain: there is therefore a third something
besides the contraries; and that is Matter (p. 1069, b. 9). Since then
the varieties of change are four: (1) &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; and &#966;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#940; (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943;),
(2) &#945;&#8020;&#958;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#952;&#943;&#963;&#953;&#962; (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;), (3) &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962; or
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;), (4) &#966;&#959;&#961;&#940; (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; or &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#8166;), each of these
changes will take place into its respective contrary: the Matter will
necessarily change, having the potentiality of both contraries (b. 14).
Ens being two-fold, all change takes place out of Ens Potentiâ into Ens
Actu, <i>e.g.</i>, out of potential white into actual white; and the
like holds for Increase and Decrease. Thus not only may there be
generation from Non-Ens accidentally but all generation takes place also
 out of Ens; that is, out of Ens Potentiâ, not Ens Actu (b. 20). This
Ens Potentiâ is what Anaxagoras really means by his Unum, which is a
better phrase than &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;; what Empedokles and Anaxagoras mean by
their &#956;&#8150;&#947;&#956;&#945;; what Demokritus means when he says &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;. They mean
that all things existed at once potentially, though not actually; and we
 see that these philosophers got partial hold of the idea of Matter
(&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8021;&#955;&#951;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#949;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953; — b. 24). All things subject to change
possess Matter, but each of them a different Matter; even the eternal
things which are not generated but moved in place, possess Matter — not
generated, but <i>from whence whither</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the Matter of
local movement pure and simple — direction: &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#953;&#776;&#948;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#8005;&#963;&#945; &#956;&#8052;
&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#966;&#959;&#961;&#8119;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#959;&#8016; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#957; (&#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957;), &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#8150; — b.
26).</p>
<p>
Since there are three varieties of Non-Ens (p. 1069, b. 27; Alexander
and Bonitz explain this &#964;&#961;&#953;&#967;&#8182;&#962; differently), it may seem difficult to
determine, out of which among the three Generation takes place. But the
answer is, that the Potential Ens is not potential of every thing alike
and at haphazard, but potential in each case from something towards
something (&#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8052; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#8005;&#956;&#969;&#962; &#959;&#8016; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#965;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;
 &#7952;&#958; &#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965; — b. 29). Nor is it enough to tell us that all things are
huddled together (&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#967;&#961;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; — b. 30); for they differ in
respect to Matter or Potentiality. If this were not so, how is it that
they are of infinite diversity, and not all One? The Noûs (<i>i.e.</i>,
according to the theory of Anaxagoras) is One; so that, if the Matter
were One also, it would become in actuality that which it was at first
in potentiality, and the result would be all One and the Same (b. 32).</p>
<p>
The Causes are thus three and the Principles are three: the pair of
Contraries, one of them Form (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;), the other Privation, and
 the third Matter (p. 1069, b. 35). But we must keep in mind that
neither Materia Prima nor Forma Prima is generated. For in all Change,
there is something (the Matter) which undergoes change; something by
which the change is effected (the Prime Movent, &#8017;&#966;’ &#959;&#8023; &#956;&#941;&#957;, &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#959;&#965;
&#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; — p. 1070, a. 1); and something into which the change takes
place (the Form). The brass becomes round; but, if both the brass
becomes and the round becomes, you will be condemned to an infinite
regression: you must stop somewhere (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#948;&#8052; &#963;&#964;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953; — a. 4). Moreover,
 every Essentia is generated out of another Essentia of the same name
and form (&#7952;&#954; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#965; — a. 5). All generated things proceed either from
 Nature, Art, Fortune, or Spontaneity. It is Nature, where the principle
 or beginning is in the subject itself; it is Art, where the principle
or beginning is in something apart from the subject; Fortune is the
privation of Art; Spontaneity is the privation of Nature (&#945;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#8054;
&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957; — a. 9). Essentiæ are threefold: (1) Matter,
which appears to be Hoc Aliquid but is not so, for detached members or
fragments, simply touching each other without coalescing, are matter and
 substratum (<i>i.e.</i>, prepared for something ulterior); (2) Nature,
which is really Hoc Aliquid — a certain definite condition, into which
generation takes place (&#7969; &#948;&#8050; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;, &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7973;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; —
a. 12); (3) The Concrete of the two preceding — the individual object
called Sokrates or Kallias. In some cases there is no Hoc Aliquid except
 in this Concrete or Compound; thus in artificial objects or
productions, such as a house or health, there is no Form except the Art
itself: the ideal house, pre-existing in the mind of the builder, is
generated and destroyed in a different sense from the real house. It is
in the case of natural objects, if in any case, that there exists a Hoc
Aliquid independent of the concrete individual (a. 17).</p>
<p>
Hence Plato was not wrong in saying that Forms were coextensive with
natural objects (&#8001;&#960;&#972;&#963;&#945; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; — p. 1070, a. 18), if there are Forms
distinct from these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621"></a>621</span>objects:
 such as fire, flesh, head, which are all properly Matter. The Last
Matter (or that which has come most under the influence of Form) belongs
 to that which is in the fullest sense Essentia (or the individual
concrete named Sokrates or Kallias — a. 20). The Moving Causes
pre-exist, as real individual beings or objects: the Formal Causes come
into existence simultaneously with the individual real compound. When
the patient becomes well, then health comes at the same time into
existence: when the brazen sphere comes, the sphericity of it comes at
the same time (a. 24). Whether any thing of the Form continues after the
 dissolution of the individual compound, is a problem to be investigated
 (a. 25). In some cases nothing hinders but what it may continue; for
example, the soul may be of such a nature: I do not mean every soul —
for every soul perhaps cannot continue — but the &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962; or rational soul
(a. 27). Still it is plain that this affords no support to the theory of
 self-existent separate Ideas; for every individual man is begotten by
another individual man. In like manner also with respect to the arts;
for the medical art affords the Form or rational explanation of health
(a. 30; <i>i.e.</i>, health is generated, not by the Idea of Health, but by the medical art, or by the artist in whom that art is embodied).</p>
<p>
Causes and principles, in one point of view, are different: different
subjects; but in another point of view, they are the same for all; that
is, if we speak generally and according to analogy (if we confine
ourselves to the most general terms, Form, Privation, Matter, &amp;c.).
In respect to Essentia, Relatio, and the remainder of the Categories, a
difficulty arises to say whether the causes, elements, and principles of
 all the Categories are the same. It would be strange if they were all
the same; because then Essentiæ, as well as Relata, would proceed out of
 the same causes and elements. For, what can these latter be? They
cannot be extra-categorical; since there exists no general class apart
from or besides Essentia and the other Categories (p. 1070, b. 1). Nor
can any one Category be the element of the others: for the element is <i>prius</i>
 to that of which it is the element. Nor again can Essentia be the
element of Relata; nor is any one of the nine Categories the element of
Essentia. Again, how is it possible that the elements of all the
Categories can be the same? No element can be the same as that compound
of which it is an element: neither B nor A can be the same as B A. If,
therefore, there were such elements, they must be extra-categorical;
which is impossible. Nor can the element in question (the supposed one
and the same) be any cogitable, such as Ens or Unum; for every
individual Concrete is both Ens and Unum and the element cannot be
identical with the compound put together out of it. Neither Essentia nor
 Relatio could be said to exist, if Ens were the element out of which
they are composed; but these Categories exist necessarily: therefore
there is no one and the same element common to all the Categories (b.
9).</p>
<p>
Yet we ought perhaps rather to repeat, what was observed before, that in
 one sense, the elements of all are the same; in another sense,
different. Take for example the perceivable bodies. We find here hot as
the Form, cold as the Privation; as Matter, there is that which is,
primarily and <i>per se</i>, both hot and cold potentially: the hot and
the cold are both Essentiæ; likewise other things of which these are the
 principles, <i>e.g.</i>, flesh and bone, which of necessity are
different from the principles out of which they proceed (b. 15). Flesh
and bone have these elements and principles; other things have other
elements and principles. The same specific principles cannot be assigned
 to all, but only principles analogous to these in each case, as saying,
 in general terms, that there are three principles — Form, Privation,
Matter. Each of these is different in every different genus; thus in
colour, the principles are white, black, surface, light, darkness, air,
and out of these are generated day and night (b. 21).</p>
<p>
The three preceding causes are all intrinsic or immanent (&#7952;&#957;&#965;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;).
But there are other causes also extrinsic, such as the Movent. So that
Principle and Element are not exactly identical; for Principle as well
as Cause includes all the four: &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#7970; &#7985;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#957; is a Principle, and is
 itself an Essentia (p. 1070, b. 25). Thus the analogous Elements are
three, while the Principles or Causes are four; but the four are
specifically different in each different case. Thus, health is Form;
sickness is Privation; body is Matter; the medical art is Movent. House
is Form; disorder of a certain sort is Privation; bricks are Matter; the
 building art is Movent. We thus make out four Causes; yet, in a certain
 sense, there will be only three (b. 32). For, in natural products, a
man is the Movent Cause of a man; in artificial products (&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#8056;
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#945;&#962;) the Movent is Form or Privation. In a certain sense, the
medical art is health, and the building art is the Form of a house, and a
 man begets a man. And farther, over and above these special movent
causes, there is the Primum Movens of all (b. 35).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622"></a>622</span>We
distinguish what is separable from what is not separable. Now Essentiæ,
and they only, are separable; accordingly they are the causes of every
thing else, since without Essentiæ there cannot be either affections or
movements (p. 1071, a. 2). Such causes would be soul and body, or
reason, appetite, and body. Again, in another sense, the principles of
all things are generically the same, though specifically different; such
 are Potentia and Actus. In some cases, the same thing exists now
potentially, at another time actually; thus wine, though actually wine,
is potentially vinegar; flesh is actually flesh, potentially a man,
Potentia and Actus will merge in the above-mentioned causes — Form,
Privation, Matter, Movent (a. 7). For the Form (if it be separable), the
 Concrete (of Form and Matter), and Privation (like darkness or
sickness) — all these exist actually; while Matter exists potentially,
capable either of Form or Privation. Things differ potentially and
actually sometimes through difference in the Matter, sometime through
difference in the Form. Thus, the cause of a man is, in the way of
Matter, the elements fire and earth; in the way of Form his own Form,
and the same Form in another individual — his father and besides these,
the Sun with its oblique motion; which last neither Matter, nor Form,
nor Privation, nor the like Form in another individual, but a Movent
Cause (&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#945; — a. 17).</p>
<p>
We must remember, besides, that some things may be described in general
terms, others cannot be so described. The first principles of all things
 are, speaking in general terms, Hoc Primum Actu and Aliud Primum
Potentiâ. These universals do not really exist (p. 1071, a. 19), for the
 principium of all individuals is some other individual. Man indeed is
the principium of the Universal Man but no Universal Man exists (a. 21).
 Peleus is the principium of Achilles; your father, of you; this B, of
that B A; B, the universal, of B A the universal. Next (after the
Movent) come the Forms of Essences; but the different genera thereof (as
 has been already stated), colours, sounds, essences, quantities,
&amp;c., have different causes and elements, though the same when
described in general terms and by analogy; also different individuals in
 the same species have different causes and elements, not indeed
different in species, but different individually; that is, your Matter,
your Movent, your Form, are different from mine, though in general terms
 and definition they are the same (&#964;&#8183; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#8050; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940; — a. 29).</p>
<p>
When therefore, we enquire, What are the principles or elements of
Essences, of Relata, of Qualities &amp;c., and whether they are the same
 or different? it is plain that, generically speaking (allowing for
difference of meaning — &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962;, p. 1071, a. 31), they are the same in
each; but, speaking distributively and with reference to particulars,
they are different, and not the same. In the following sense (&#8033;&#948;&#943; — a.
34), they are the same, namely, in the way of Analogy (&#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957;).
They are always Matter, Form, Privation, the Movent; hence the causes of
 Essences are causes of all other things, since, when Essences
disappear, all the rest disappears along with them: besides all these,
there is the Primum Movens Actuale, common to all (&#7956;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;
&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#8115; — a. 36). In the following sense, again, they are different —
 when we cease to speak of genera, and pass from equivocal terms to
particulars: wherever there are different opposites (as white and black,
 health and sickness) and wherever there are different Matters (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#964;&#953;
&#945;&#7985; &#8023;&#955;&#945;&#953; — p. 1071, b. 1; &#8023;&#955;&#945;&#953; in the plural, rare).</p>
<p>
We have thus declared, respecting the principles of Perceivable
Essences, what and how many they are; in what respect the same, and in
what respect they are different. Essences are threefold; two Physical
and one Immoveable. We shall proceed to speak of this last. There
exists, of necessity, some Eternal, Immoveable Essence. For Essences are
 the first of all existent things; and, if they all be perishable, every
 thing is perishable. But it is impossible that Motion can ever have
been generated or can ever be destroyed; for it always existed: it is
eternal. There is the like impossibility about Time: for, if Time did
not exist, there could be nothing <i>prius</i> and nothing <i>posterius</i>
 (p. 1071, b. 8). Both Motion and Time are thus eternal; both are also
continuous; for either the two are identical, or Time is an affection
(&#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;) of Motion. Now no mode of Motion is continuous except local
motion; and that in a circle (for rectilinear motion cannot be
continuous and eternal). There must be a Movent or Producent Principle
(&#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#7970; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957; — b. 12); but, if the Movent existed potentially
and not actually, there could not be motion continuous and eternal; for
that which has mere power may never come into act. There will be no use
therefore in such eternal Essences as Plato assumes in his Ideas, unless
 there be along with them some principle of potential change (&#949;&#7984; &#956;&#942; &#964;&#953;&#962;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957; — b. 15). Nor indeed will even that be
 sufficient (<i>i.e.</i>, any principle of <i>merely potential</i> change), nor any other Essence (such as Numbers — Schwegler) besides or along with the Platonic Ideas; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>623</span>for, if this <i>principium</i>
 shall not come into Actuality (&#949;&#7984; &#956;&#8052; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953; — b. 17), the motion
which we postulate, continuous and eternal, will not result from it. Nor
 will it even be sufficient that the Movent Principle should be supposed
 to be in actuality or operation (&#959;&#8016;&#948;’ &#949;&#7984; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;, p. 1071, b. 18), if
 its Essence be Potentiality: the motion resulting therefrom cannot be
eternal; for that which exists potentially may perhaps not exist at all.
 The Movent Principles therefore must be something of which the Essence
is Actuality (b. 19), and which shall be without Matter, for they must
be eternal, otherwise nothing else can be eternal. They must therefore
be essential Actualities (b. 22).</p>
<p>
Here however, a difficulty suggests itself. It seems that every thing
which is in actuality must also be in potentiality, but that every thing
 which is in potentiality does not in every case come into actuality: so
 that Potentiality seems the <i>prius</i> of the two (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8050;&#957;
&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957; — p. 1071, b. 24;
 Bonitz compares p. 1060, a. 1: &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;). But, if this
were true, no Entia could exist; for it may be that they exist
potentially, but not yet exist actually (b. 26). There is the like
impossibility, if we adopt the theory of those theologians (Orpheus,
Hesiod, &amp;c.) who take their departure from Night, or of those
physical philosophers who begin with a chaotic huddle of all things. In
both cases such original condition is one of mere potentiality; and how
can it ever be put in motion, if there is to be no cause in actuality
(&#949;&#7984; &#956;&#951;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8115; &#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; — b. 29)? Matter will never cause motion
 in itself, but must wait for the carpenter’s art; nor will the earth,
but must wait for seed.</p>
<p>
It is for this reason that some philosophers, like Plato and Leukippus,
represent Actuality as eternal; for they say that motion has always
existed. But they do not say what variety of motion, nor why that
variety, to the exclusion of others. For nothing is moved at haphazard;
there must always be some reason why it is moved in one way rather than
another: for example, by nature in one way; by other causes, such as
violence or Noûs, in some other way (p. 1071, b. 36). But it is not
competent to Plato to assume what he sometimes does assume as principium
 (p. 1072, a. 2 — allusion to Plato Phædrus 245, E), viz., a
Self-Movent; for Plato affirms (in Timæus 34, B) that the soul is <i>posterius</i>,
 and coæval with the Kosmos. The doctrine just mentioned — That the
Potential is prior to the Actual — is true in one sense, but not true in
 another; we have already explained <i>how</i> (&#949;&#7988;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#8182;&#962; — a. 4. Schwegler thinks, note p. 254, that this &#949;&#7988;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953; refers to what has been said in Book <span class="smcap">&#920;</span>,
 p. 1049, b. 3, seq.; and this seems probable, though Bonitz in his note
 contests it, and refers to his own theory, set forth in his Proœmium
pp. 24, 25, that Book <span class="smcap">&#923;</span> is a separate
treatise of Aristotle, completely distinct from all the rest of the
Metaphysica. This theory of Bonitz may be in the main true; but it is
still possible that Book <span class="smcap">&#920;</span> may have been written previously, and that Aristotle may here refer to it, as Schwegler supposes.)<span class="correction" title="stop omitted">.</span> </p>
<p>
That Actuality is prior to Potentiality, is conformable to the doctrine
of Anaxagoras, Noûs in his doctrine existing in Actuality; also to that
of Empedokles, who introduces Friendship and Enmity; and again, to that
of Leukippus, who affirms Motion to be eternal. So that Chaos or Night (<i>i.e.</i>,
 mere Potentiality) did not prevail for an infinite anterior time, but
the same things came round in perpetual vicissitude or rotation; which
consists with the doctrine that Actuality is prior to Potentiality. If
the same condition comes round periodically, we must necessarily assume
something Actual, which perpetually actualizes in the same manner (&#948;&#949;&#8150;
&#964;&#953; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#8033;&#963;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957; — p. 1072, a. 10). Again, if generation
and destruction are to take place, we must assume something else Actual,
 which actualizes in a manner perpetually changing (&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#949;&#8054;
&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; — a. 12). This last must actualize sometimes <i>per se</i>,
 sometimes in a different way; that is, according to some other
influence, or according to the First (or Uniform) Actual. But it will
necessarily actualize according to the First Actual; which will thus be a
 cause both to itself, and to the variable Actual. Now the First Actual
is the best; for it is the cause of perpetual sameness, while the other
is cause of variety; both together are the cause of unceasing variety.
But this is how the motions really stand. Why then, should we look out
for other principles (a. 18)?</p>
<p>
Now, since the preceding views are consistent with the facts and may be
true (&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#948;’ &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#964;’ &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; — p. 1072, a. 18) — and, if they be not
true, we shall be compelled to admit that every thing proceeds either
from Night, or from confused Chaos or Non-Ens — we may consider the
problem as solved. There exists something always in unceasing circular
motion: this is evident not merely from reason, but from fact. The First
 Heaven (Aplanês or Fixed Star sphere) will <span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id="page624"></a>624</span>therefore
 be eternal. There must therefore exist something which causes this
unceasing motion, or some Prime Movent. But, since Movens Immobile,
Movens Motum, Motum non Movens, form a series of three terms, and since
the two last of these certainly exist, we may infer that the first
exists also; and that the Prime Movent, which causes the motion of the
Aplanês, is immoveable (a. <span class="correction" title="amended from '2-025'">20-25</span>.
 — This passage perplexes all the commentators — Schwegler, Bonitz,
Alexander, &amp;c. It can hardly be construed without more or less
change of the text. I do not see to what real things Aristotle can
allude under the description of Mota which are not Moventia. There is
much to be said for Pierron and Zévort’s translation, p. 220: “Comme il
n'y a que trois sortes d’êtres — ce qui est mu, ce qui meut, et le moyen
 terme entre ce qui est mu et ce qui meut: c’est un être (<i>i.e.</i>,
this middle term is an être) qui meut sans être mu.” — Bonitz
disapproves this interpretation of the word &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;, and it is certainly
singular to say that between <i>Movens</i> and <i>Motum</i>, the term <i>Movens sed non Motum</i> forms a medium: <i>Motum sed non Movens</i> would form just as good a medium<span class="correction" title="stop omitted">.</span>).
 This Prime Movent, which causes motion without being itself moved, must
 be eternal, must be Essentia, and must be an Actuality.</p>
<p>
Now both the Appetibile (&#964;&#8056; &#8000;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#957;) and the Cogitabile (&#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;) cause motion in this way, <i>i.e.</i>,
 without being moved themselves; moreover the Primum Appetibile and the
Primum Cogitabile are coincident or identical (p. 1072, a. 27). For that
 which appears beautiful, is the object of desire; but that which is
beautiful, is the first object of will (a. 28). Cogitation is the
principium of the two (the primary fact or fundamental element): we will
 so and so, because we think it good; it is not true that we think it
good because we will it (&#8000;&#961;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;, &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7970; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;
&#8000;&#961;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945; — a. 29). Now the Cogitant Mind (&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) is moved by the
Cogitabile, and, in the series of fundamental Contraries, the members of
 one side of the series are Cogitabilia <i>per se</i> (while those of the other side are only Cogitabilia <i>per aliud</i> — &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8052; &#948;’ &#7969; &#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#963;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#942;&#957; — a. 31; see Alex., p. 668, 16, Bon.). These Cogitabilia <i>per se</i> are first as to Essentia (<i>i.e.</i>, compared with the Cogitabilia <i>per aliud</i>, they are logically <i>priora</i>): and again, among Essentiæ, that variety which is simple and actual comes first (<i>i.e.</i>, it is logically <i>prius</i>,
 as compared with the compound and the potential). Now Unum is not
identical with Simplex: Unum signifies that which is a measure of
something else, while Simplex denotes a peculiar attribute of the
subject in itself (a. 34). But the Pulchrum and the Eligibile <i>per se</i> belongs to the same side of the series of Contraries, as the Cogitabilia <i>per se</i>: and the Primum Pulchrum or Eligibile is the Best or akin thereunto, in its own particular ascending scale (b. 1).</p>
<p>
That &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945; is among the Immoveables, may be seen by our Treatise
De Bono, where we give a string of generic and specific distributions (&#7969;
 &#948;&#953;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#8150; — p. 1072, b. 2; see the interpretation of Alexander,
adopted both by Schwegler and by Bonitz). For &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945; is used in a
double sense: in one of the two senses it ranks among the Immoveables:
in another it does not (&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#948;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8023; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;, b. 3 — &#948;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#972;&#957; is
Schwegler’s correction, adopted by Bonitz). It causes motion, in the
manner of a beloved object; and that which it causes to move, causes
motion in the other things (&#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150; &#948;&#8050; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;· &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945;
 &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150; — b. 3; &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; is the conjecture of Schwegler and
Bonitz). </p>
<p>
Now, if any thing be moved, there is a possibility that it may be in a
condition different from that in which it actually is. If the first
actuality of the Moveable be translation or motion in space, there is a
possibility that it may be otherwise than it is as to place, even though
 it cannot be otherwise than it is as to Essentia (p. 1072, b. 7).</p>
<p>
But, as to the Prime Movent, which is itself immoveable, and which exists in actuality, it is impossible that <i>that</i>
 can be other than what it is, in any respect whatever (p. 1072, b. 8).
For the first of all changes is local motion, or rotation in a circle,
and this is exactly what the Prime Movent imparts (but does not itself
possess). It exists by necessity, and by that species of necessity
which implies the perfect and beautiful: and in this character it is
the originating principle. For there are three varieties of necessity:
(1) That of violence, in contradiction to the natural impulse; (2) That
without which good or perfection cannot be had; (3) That which is what
it is absolutely, without possibility of being otherwise. From a
principle of this nature (<i>i.e.</i>, necessary in the two last senses) depend the Heaven and all Nature (b. 14).</p>
<p>
The mode of existence (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;) of this Prime Movent is for ever that which <i>we</i>
 enjoy in our best moments, but which we cannot obtain permanently; for
its actuality itself is also pleasure (p. 1072, b. 16). As actuality is
pleasure, so the various actualities of waking, perceiving, cogitating,
are to us the pleasantest part of our life; while hopes and remembrances
 are pleasing by derivation from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id="page625"></a>625</span>them (but these states we men cannot enjoy permanently and without intermittence). Cogitation <i>per se</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, cogitation in its most perfect condition) embraces that which is best <i>per se</i>;
 and most of all when it is most perfect. The Noûs thus cogitates itself
 through participation of the Cogitabile: for it becomes itself
cogitable by touching the Cogitabile and cogitating: so that Cogitans
and Cogitabile become identical. For Noûs in general (the human Noûs
also) is in potentiality the recipient of the Cogitabile, and of
Essentia or Forms; and it comes into actuality by possessing these
Forms. So that what the Prime Movent possesses is more divine than the
divine element which Noûs in general involves; and the actuality of
theorizing is the pleasantest and best of all conditions (&#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961;
&#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#952;&#953;&#947;&#947;&#940;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#959;&#8182;&#957;, &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;. &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957;

&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#8003; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#8001; &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8056; &#7973;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; —
 b. 24. This is a very difficult passage, in which one cannot be sure of
 interpreting rightly. None of the commentators are perfectly
satisfactory. The pronoun &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959; seems to refer to &#7969; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#952;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#942;&#957;
 — three lines back. The contrast seems to be between the Prime Movent,
and Noûs in general, including the human Noûs. &#932;&#8056; &#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957; cannot refer
to the Prime Movent, which has no potentiality, but must refer to the
human Noûs, which is not at first, nor always, in a state of actuality.
&#924;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; seems equivalent to &#952;&#949;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;. The human Noûs has &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953;, by
reason of its potentiality to theorize.).</p>
<p>
Thus it is wonderful, if God has perpetually an existence like that of
our best moments; and still more wonderful, if he has a better. Yet such
 is the fact. Life belongs to him: for the actuality of Noûs is life,
and God is actuality. His life, eternal and best, is actuality <i>per se</i> (or <i>par excellence</i>). We declare God to be an Animal Optimum Æternum, so that duration eternal and continuous (&#945;&#7984;&#8060;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#942;&#962;) belongs to him: for <i>that</i> is God (&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962; — p. 1072, b. 30).</p>
<p>
The Pythagoreans and Speusippus are mistaken in affirming that Optimum
and Pulcherrimum is not to be found in the originating principle (&#7952;&#957;
&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8135;); on the ground that the principles of plants and animals are
indeed causes, but that the beautiful and perfect appears first in the
results of those principles. For the seed first proceeds out of
antecedent perfect animals: the first is not seed, but the perfect
animal. Thus we must say that the man is prior to the seed: I do not
mean the man who sprang from the seed, but the other man from whom the
seed proceeded (p. 1073, a. 2).</p>
<p>
From the preceding reasonings, it is evident that there exists an
Essence eternal, immoveable, and separated from all the perceivable
Essences. We have shown (in Physica; see Schwegler’s note) that this
Essence can have no magnitude; that it is without parts and indivisible
(p, 1073, a. 6). For it causes in other subjects motion for an infinite
time; and nothing finite can have infinite power. For this reason the
Prime Movent cannot have finite magnitude; but every magnitude is either
 finite or infinite, and there is no such thing as infinite magnitude;
therefore the Prime Movent can have no magnitude at all. We have also
shown that it is unchangeable in quality, and without any affections
(&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#8050;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;). For all other varieties of change are
posterior as compared with locomotive change or motion in space, which
is the first of all. As the Prime Movent is exempt from this first, much
 more is it exempt from the others (a. 13).</p>
<p>
We must now consider whether we ought to recognize one such Movent or
Essence only, or several of the same Essences? and, if several, how
many? Respecting the number thereof we must remember that our
predecessors have laid down no clear or decisive doctrines (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;,
p. 1073, a. 16). The Platonic theory of Ideas includes no peculiar
research on this subject (a. 18). The Platonists call these Ideas
Numbers: about which they talk sometimes as if there were an infinite
multitude of them, sometimes as if they were fixed as reaching to the
dekad and not higher — but they furnish no demonstrative reason why they
 should stop at the dekad. We shall proceed to discuss the point
consistently with our preceding definitions and with the nature of the
subjects (a. 23). The Principium, the First of all Entia, is immoveable
both <i>per se</i> and <i>per accidens</i>: it causes motion in another
subject, to which it imparts the first or locomotive change, one and
eternal (a. 25). The Motum must necessarily be moved by something; the
Prime Movent must be immoveable <i>per se</i>; eternal motion must be
caused by an eternal Movent; and one motion by one Movent (a. 30). But
we see that, over and above the simple rotation of the All (or First
Heaven), which rotation we affirm to be caused by the Primum Movens
Immobile, there are also other eternal rotations of the Planets; for the
 circular Celestial Body, as we have shown in the Physica, is eternal
and never at rest (a. 32). We must therefore necessarily assume that
each of these rotations of the Planets is caused by a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id="page626"></a>626</span>Movent Immoveable <i>per se</i>
 — by an eternal Essence (a. 35). For the Stars and Planets are in their
 nature eternal Essences: that which moves them must be itself eternal,
and prior to that which it causes to be moved; likewise that which, is
prior to Essence must itself be Essence, and cannot be any thing else
(a. 37). It is plain, therefore, that there must necessarily exist a
number of Essences, each eternal by nature, immoveable <i>per se</i>,
and without magnitude, as Movents to the Heavenly Bodies and equal in
number thereto (a. 38). These Essences are arranged in an order of
first, second, &amp;c., corresponding to the order of the planetary
rotations (b. 2), But what the number of these rotations is, we must
learn from Astronomy — that one among the mathematical sciences which is
 most akin (&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962;) to the First Philosophy; for Astronomy
theorizes about Essence perceivable but eternal, while Arithmetic and
Geometry do not treat of any Essence at all (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#953;&#8118;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; — b.
7). That the rotations are more in number than the rotating bodies, is
known to all who have any tincture of Astronomy; for each of the Planets
 is carried round in more than one rotation (b. 10). But what the exact
number of these rotations is, we shall proceed to state upon the
authority of some mathematicians, for the sake of instruction, that the
reader may have some definite number present to his mind: for the rest,
he must both investigate for himself and put questions to other
investigators; and, if he learns from the scientific men any thing
dissenting from what we here lay down, he must love both dissentients
but follow that one who reasons most accurately (&#966;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962;,
&#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; — b. 16).</p>
<p>
Aristotle then proceeds to unfold the number and arrangement of the
planetary spheres and the corrective or counter-rolling (&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;)
spheres implicated with them (p. 1073, b. 17 — p. 1074, a. 14). He
afterwards proceeds: Let the number of spheres thus be forty-seven; so
that it will be reasonable to assume the Immoveable Movent Essences and
Principles to be forty-seven also, as well as the perceivable spheres
(&#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;&#962; — p. 1074, a. 16): we say <i>reasonable</i> (&#949;&#8020;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957;), for we
shall leave to stronger heads to declare it necessary. But, since there
cannot be any rotation except such as contributes to the rotation of one
 of the Planets, and since we must assume that each Nature and each
Essence is exempt from extraneous affection and possessed <i>per se</i> of the Best as an end, so there will be no other Nature besides the forty-seven above enumerated, and this number will be the <i>necessary</i>
 total of the Essences (a. 21). For, if there were any others, they
would cause motion by serving as an end for some rotation to aspire to
(&#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#949;&#957; &#7938;&#957; &#8033;&#962; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8022;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#966;&#959;&#961;&#8118;&#962; — a. 23); but it is impossible that
there can be any other rotation besides those that have been enumerated.</p>
<p>
We may fairly infer this from the bodies which are carried in rotation
(&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; — p. 1074, a. 24). For, if every carrier exists
naturally for the sake of the thing carried, and if every current or
rotation is a current of something carried, there can exist no current
either for the sake of itself or for the sake of some other current.
Every current must exist for the sake of the Planets, and with a view to
 their rotation. For, if one current existed for the sake of another,
this last must exist for the sake of a third, and so on; but you cannot
go on in this way <i>ad infinitum</i>; and therefore the end of every
current must be, one or other of the Divine Bodies which are carried
round in the heavens (a. 31).</p>
<p>
That there is only one Heaven, we may plainly see. For, if there were
many heavens, as there are many men, the principium of each would be one
 <i>in specie</i>, though the principia would be many <i>in numero</i>
(p. 1074, a. 33). But all things that are many in number, have Matter,
and are many, by reason of their Matter; for to all these many, there is
 one and the same Form (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;) — definition or rational explanation: <i>e.g.</i>,
 one for all men, among whom Sokrates is one (a. 35). But the First
Essence has no Matter; for it is an Actual (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;
&#8021;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;· &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945; <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#947;&#8048;&#961;'">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span>
 — a. 36). The Primum Movens Immobile is therefore One, both in
definition and in number; accordingly, the Motum — that which is moved
both eternally and continuously — is One also. There exists therefore
only one Heaven (p. 1074, a. 38).</p>
<p>
Now it has been handed down in a mythical way, from the old and most
ancient teachers (p. 1074, b. 1) to their successors, that these
(Eternal Essences) are gods, and that the divine element comprehends all
 nature (&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#943; &#964;&#941; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8005;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; —
b. 3). The other accompaniments of the received creed have been
superadded with a view to persuading the multitude and to useful
purposes for the laws and the common interest (b. 4); wherefore the gods
 have been depicted as like to men and to some other animals, combined
with other similar accompaniments. If a man, abstracting from these
stories, accepts only the first and fundamental truth — That they
conceived the First <span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id="page627"></a>627</span>Essences
 as gods, he will consider it as a divine doctrine (&#952;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#8134;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#949;&#957; — b. 9), preserved and handed down as fragments of truth from
the most ancient times. For probably all art and philosophy and truth
have been many times discovered, lost, and rediscovered. To this point
alone, and thus far, the opinion of our fathers and of the first men is
evident to us (b. 14).</p>
<p>
There are however various difficulties connected with the Noûs; for it
would seem to be more divine than the visible celestial objects, and yet
 we do not understand what its condition can be to be such (p. 1074, b.
17). For, if it cogitates nothing but is in the condition of slumber and
 inaction, what ground can there be for respecting it (&#964;&#943; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#951; &#964;&#8056;
&#963;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#972;&#957; — b. 18)? And, if it cogitates something actually, yet if this
process depends upon something foreign and independent (<i>i.e.</i>,
upon the Cogitatum), the Noûs cannot be the best Essence; since it is
then essentially not Cogitation in act, but only the potentiality of
Cogitation; while its title to respect arises from actual Cogitation.
Again, whether we assume its Essence to be Cogitation actual or
Cogitation potential, <i>what</i> does it cogitate? It must cogitate
either itself, or something different from itself; and, if the latter,
either always the same Cogitatum, or sometimes one, sometimes another.
But is there no difference whether its Cogitatum is honourable or
vulgar? Are there not some things which it is absurd to cogitate?
Evidently the Noûs must cogitate what is most divine and most
honourable, without any change; for, if it did change, it must change
for the worse, and that very change would at once (&#7972;&#948;&#951;) be a certain
motion; whereas the Noûs is essentially immoveable (b. 27). First of
all, if the Essence of the Noûs be, not Cogitation actual but Cogitation
 potential, we may reasonably conceive that the perpetuity of Cogitation
 would be fatiguing to it (b. 29); next, we see plainly that there must
exist something else more honourable than the Noûs; namely, the
Cogitatum; for to cogitate, and the act of cogitation, will belong even
to one who cogitates the vilest object. If cogitation of vile objects be
 detestable (&#966;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#957;, b. 32) — for not to see some things is better than
 to see them — Cogitation cannot be the best of all things (<i>i.e.</i>, Cogitation absolutely, whatever be the Cogitatum).</p>
<p>
Since the Noûs is itself the best of all things, it must employ its
cogitation upon itself and nothing else. Its cogitation will thus be
Cogitation of Cogitation (&#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#945; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;, &#949;&#7988;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7969; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; — p. 1074, b. 35). Yet, if we look to the
human mind, Cognition, Perception, Opinion, Mental Discourse, &amp;c.,
appear always as having direct reference to something else, and as
referring each to itself only in an indirect and secondary way (&#7936;&#949;&#8054;
&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965; — &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#948;’ &#7952;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#8179; — b. 36); and farther, if to cogitate is one
 thing and to be cogitated another thing, in which of the two points of
view will the <i>bene</i> of the Noûs consist? To be Cogitation, and to
be a Cogitatum, are not logically the same (&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;
&#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#959;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179; — b. 38).</p>
<p>
But may we not meet these difficulties by replying that there are some
things in which Cognition is identical with the Cognitum? that is, in
those Cognita which are altogether exempt from Matter? In Constructive
cognitions without Matter, the Form and the &#964;.&#951;.&#949;. is both Cognitum and
Cognitio; in Theoretical cognitions without Matter, the Notion and the
Cogitation is itself the Cognitum (&#8001; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;).
Since it appears, therefore, that, wherever there is no Matter,
Cogitatum and Noûs are not different, the same will be true of the
divine Noûs: its Cogitatio and its Cogitatum will be identical (p. 1075,
 a. 5).</p>
<p>
One farther difficulty remains, if we suppose the Cogitatum to be a
Compound (&#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957;); for, on that supposition, the Cogitans would change
 in running through the different parts of the whole. But the reply
seems to be, that every thing which has not Matter is indivisible and
not compound (p. 1075, a. 7). As the human Noûs, being that which deals
with compounds, comports itself for a certain time — for it does not
attain its <i>bene</i> in cogitating this or that part of the compound,
but in apprehending a certain total or completion which is something
different from any of the parts — so does the divine Noûs, engaged in
cogitation of itself, comport itself in perpetuity (a. 10).</p>
<p>
Another point to be considered is — in what manner the nature of the
Universe (&#7969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8005;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; — p. 1075, a. 11) includes Bonum and Optimum.
 Is Bonum included as something separate and as an adjunct by itself
transcendent? Or is it immanent, pervading the whole arrangement of the
constituent parts? Or does it exist in both ways at once, as in the case
 of a disciplined army; for, in this latter, Bonum belongs both to the
array and to the general, and indeed more to the latter, since the array
 is directed by the general, not the general by the array. All things in
 the universe are marshalled in a certain orderly way — the aquatic
creatures, the aërial, and the plants; but all things are not marshalled
 alike. The universe is not such that there is no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id="page628"></a>628</span>relation
 between one thing and another: there is such a relation; for every
thing is marshalled with a view to one end, though in different degrees.
 As, in a family, the freemen have least discretion left to them to act
at haphazard, but all or most of their proceedings are regulated, while
slaves and oxen are not required to do much towards the common good, but
 are left for the most part to act at hazard, — in this way the
principium of each is arranged by nature (a. 23). For example, every
thing must necessarily come to the termination of one individual
existence to make room for another: there are also some other facts and
conditions common to all things in the universe (&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969; &#948;’ &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#962; &#947;&#949; &#964;&#8056;
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#7937;&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; — a. 23; see the explanation of
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;, given by Bonitz, Comm. p. 519 — not very certain).</p>
<p>
In concluding this exposition, we must not lose sight of the absurdities
 and impossibilities which attach to all other, nor what is advanced by
the most ingenious philosophers before us, nor which of their theories
carries with it the fewest difficulties (p. 1075, a. 27). </p>
<p>
That all things proceed from Contraries, all these philosophers agree in
 affirming. But it is not true that all things are generated, nor that
they are generated from contraries; for the celestial substance is not
generated at all, nor has it any contrary. Moreover, in those cases
where there really are contraries, these philosophers do not teach us
how generation can take place out of them; for contraries themselves
have no effect upon each other. Now our doctrine solves this difficulty
reasonably, by introducing a <i>tertium quid</i> (p. 1075, a. 31) —
Matter. Some of these philosophers erroneously consider Matter to be
itself one of the contraries: they consider the Unequal as matter or
substratum to the Equal; or the Many as matter or substratum to the One;
 (Evil, as opposed to Good). We resolve this in the same way: our Matter
 is one, is contrary itself to nothing, but may be potentially either of
 two contraries. Farthermore, if we admit the doctrine that Evil itself
is Matter or one of the elements, the inference will follow that every
thing whatever, except the Unum itself, partakes of Evil (a. 6).</p>
<p>
Some philosophers do not admit either Good or Evil to be principles at
all; but they are manifestly wrong; for in all things Good is most of
all the principle (p. 1075, a. 37). Others again are so far right that
they recognize Good as a principle: but they do not tell us <i>how</i> it is a principle — whether as End, or as Movent, or as Form.</p>
<p>
Empedokles lays down a strange doctrine: he makes Friendship to be the
Good (p. 1075, b. 2). But, in his theory, Friendship is principle partly
 as Movent, for its function is to bring together (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; — b. 3);
partly as Matter, for it is itself a portion of the mixture (&#956;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#956;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; — b. 4). Now, even granting the possibility that the same thing
 may be <i>per accidens</i> (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; — b. 5, <i>i.e.</i>, by
special coincidence in any one particular case) principle as Movent, and
 also principle as Matter, nevertheless the two are not the same
logically and by definition. Under which of the two, therefore, are we
to reckon Friendship? It is moreover another strange feature in the
theory of Empedokles, that he makes Enmity to be indestructible; for
this very Enmity is with him the nature and principle of Evil (b. 8).</p>
<p>
Anaxagoras declares Good to be the principle as Movent; for, in his
theory, Noûs causes motion; but it causes motion with a view to some
end, which is of course different from itself; so that the real
principle is different from Noûs: unless indeed he adopted one of our
tenets; for we too say that, in a certain sense, the medical art is
health (p. 1075, b. 10; <span class="smcap">Z.</span> vii. p. 1032, b.
10). It is moreover absurd, that Anaxagoras does not recognize any
contrary to Good and to the Noûs (b. 11). (Bonitz remarks, Comm. p.
522:— Aristotle means that Anaxagoras was wrong, because he failed “ad
eam devenire rationem, ut intellectum sui ipsius intelligentiam ideoque
sui ipsius &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962; esse statueret”; farther, he remarks, on the line b. 10
 — &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#8052; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8183; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183; &#957;&#8183;: “Quid enim?
nonne pariter et eodem jure &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#7936;&#956;&#953;&#947;&#942;&#962;, quem posuit Anaxagoras, ab omni
 contrarietate et oppositione immunis sit, ac primus motor apud
Aristotelem?” — Aristotle would have replied to this: “I recognize
principles of Evil under the names of &#8021;&#955;&#951; and &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;; the last of the
two being directly opposed to Form (Regularity or Good), the first of
the two being indifferent and equally ready as a recipient both for evil
 and for good. My Prime Movent acts like an &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; in causing motion
in the Celestial Substance: the motion of this last is pure Good,
without any mixture of Evil. But, when this motion is transmitted to the
 sublunary elements, it becomes corrupted by &#8021;&#955;&#951; and &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, so that
Evil becomes mingled with the Good. Anaxagoras recognizes no
counteracting principles, analogous to &#8021;&#955;&#951; and &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, so that Evil,
on his theory, remains unexplained.”) </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629"></a>629</span>Those
 philosophers who lay down Contraries as their principles, do not make
proper use of these Contraries, unless their language be improved or
modified (p. 1075, b. 12). Nor do they tell us why some things are
destructible, other things indestructible; for they trace all things to
the same principles. Some make all things to proceed from Non-Ens;
others, to escape that necessity, make all things One (and thus
recognize no real change or generation at all — the Eleates, b. 16).
Again, not one of them tells us why generation must always be, or what
is the cause of generation. Once more, those who recognize two contrary
principles must necessarily recognize a third superior to both (b. 18);
and the Platonists with their Ideas are under the like necessity. For
they must assign some reason why particular things partake of these
Ideas.</p>
<p>
Other philosophers, moreover, must consistently with their theories
recognize something contrary to Wisdom and to the most venerable
Cognition. But we are under no such necessity; for there is nothing
contrary to the First (&#964;&#8183; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#8179;). All contraries involve Matter, and are
 in potentiality the same: one of the two contraries is ignorance in
regard to the other; but the First has no contrary (p. 1075, b. 24).</p>
<p>
Again, if there be no Entia beyond the Perceptibilia, there can be no
beginning, no arrangement in order, no generation, no celestial bodies
or proceedings (<i>i.e.</i>, all these will remain unexplained). There will always be a beginning behind the beginning, <i>ad infinitum</i>;
 as there is in the theories of all the theologians and physical
philosophers (p. 1075, b. 27). And, even if we recognize, beyond the
Perceptibilia, Ideas or Numbers, these are causes of nothing; or, if
causes of any thing, they are certainly not causes of motion. How,
moreover, can Magnitude, and a Continuum arise out of that which has no
Magnitude? Number cannot, either as Movent or as Form, produce a
Continuum (b. 30).</p>
<p>
Again, (Contraries cannot be principles, because) no Contrary can be
essentially Constructive and essentially Movent (p. 1075, b. 31); for
Contraries involve Matter and Potentiality, and may possibly, therefore,
 not exist. And, if there be Potentiality, it will come prior to
Actuality: upon that supposition therefore (<i>i.e.</i>, of Contraries
as the fundamental principles) Entia could not be eternal. But Entia are
 eternal; therefore these theories must be in part amended: we have
shown how (b. 34).</p>
<p>
Farther, none of these theories explains how it is that numbers coalesce
 into One; or soul and body into One; or Form and Matter into one
Concrete. Nor can they explain this, unless they adopt our doctrine,
that the Movent brings about this coalition (p. 1075, b. 37).</p>
<p>
Those philosophers (like Speusippus) who recognize many different grades
 and species of Entia (first the Mathematical Number, &amp;c.), with
separate principles for each, make the Essence of the Universe to be
incoherent (&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#948;&#953;&#974;&#948;&#951; — p. 1076, a. 1) and set up many distinct
principles; for none of these Essences contributes to or bears upon the
remainder, whether it exists or does not exist. Now Entia are not
willing to be badly governed (&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#8050; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#959;&#8016; &#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#8182;&#962;.

<p>C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 1. — The science of Nature has for its
 principal object — Bodies, Magnitudes, and the various affections and
movements of Bodies and Magnitudes; also the beginnings or principles of
 this sort of Essence. The Continuous is that which is divisible into
parts perpetually divisible: and Body is that which is divisible in
every direction. Of magnitudes, some (lines) are divisible only in one
direction; others (planes) only in two directions; others again (bodies)
 in three directions. This is the maximum: there is no other magnitude
beyond; for three are all, and to say “in three directions” is the same
as to say “in all directions.” As the Pythagoreans say, The Universe and
 All Things are determined by Three: in End, Middle, and Beginning, lies
 the number of the Universe, or the Triad. We have received these as
laws from nature, and we accordingly employ this number (Three) for
solemnities in honour of the Gods. Moreover, we apply our predicates on
the same principle; for we call Two, and The Two — Both, but we do not
call them all. Three is the first number to which we apply the predicate
 All. Herein (as was observed before) we follow the lead of Nature
herself. Since therefore these three phrases — All Things, The Universe,
 The Perfect or Complete — do not specifically differ from each other,
but are distinguished only in respect of the matter or occasions on
which they are applied. Body is the only kind of magnitude which can be
declared Perfect or Complete, that is, All; for it is the only magnitude
 determined or defined by the Three. Being divisible in three
directions, it is divisible every way; other magnitudes are divisible
either only in one way or only in two. Magnitudes are both divisible and
 continuous according to the number by which they are designated —
continuous in one direction, in two, in three, or all. All divisible
magnitudes are also continuous: whether all continuous magnitudes are
divisible, is not yet clear. But what <i>is</i> clear is — that there is
 no upward transition to a higher genus beyond Body, as there is from
line to surface, and from surface to Body. If there were, Body would not
 be perfect or complete as a magnitude; for the transition would be made
 at the point of deficiency; but the perfect or complete can have no
deficiency: it stretches every way. Such is each body included as a part
 in the universe: it has dimensions in every direction. Yet each is
distinguished from its neighbour by contact, and each therefore in a
certain sense is many. But the Universe (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8118;&#957;) including all these
parts is of necessity perfect and complete; extending not merely in one
way, and in another way not, but &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#8131;, as the word literally means (ss.
 1-4). </p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 2. — Respecting the nature of the
Universe, we shall enquire presently whether in the aggregate it be
infinite or of finite magnitude. But first let us speak about its
different constituent species, proceeding on the following basis. I
affirm that all natural bodies and magnitudes are <i>per se</i> locally
moveable; and that Nature is to them a beginning or principle of motion.
 Now all Local Motion (known by the name of &#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;) is either Rectilinear
or Circular, or compounded of the two; for these two are the only simple
 motions, by reason that the only two simple magnitudes are the
rectilinear and the circular. The circular is motion round the Centre;
the rectilinear is motion either downwards towards the centre or upwards
 from the centre. These three are the only simple modes of motion or
currents: as I said in the last chapter that body was made complete in
the number three, so also the motion of body is made complete in the
number three. Now, as there are some bodies (such as fire, earth, and
their cognates) which are simple (<i>i.e.</i> which have in themselves a
 natural beginning or principle of motion), and others which are
compounds of these, so also there must be simple motions belonging to
the former and compound motions belonging to the latter; such compound
motions being determined by the preponderant element therein. Since,
therefore, circular motion is a simple mode of motion, and since simple
modes of motion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631"></a>631</span>
 belong only to simple bodies, there must of necessity be a particular
variety of simple body, whose especial nature it is to be carried round
in circular motion. By violence, indeed, one body might be moved in a
mode belonging to another; but not by nature. Moreover, since motion
against nature is opposite to motion conformable to nature, and since
each mode has one single opposite, simple circular motion, if it be not
conformable to the nature of this body, must be against its nature. If
then the body rotating in a circle be fire or any of the other elements,
 its natural mode of motion must be opposite to circular motion. But
each thing has only one opposite; and up and down are each other’s
opposites. If then the body which rotates in a circle rotates thus
against nature, it must have some other mode of motion conformable to
nature. But this is impossible: for, if the motion conformable to its
nature be motion upwards, the body must be fire or air; if motion
downwards, the body must be earth or water (and there is no other simple
 mode of motion that it can have). Moreover, its rotatory motion must be
 a first motion; for the perfect is prior in nature to the imperfect.
Now the circle is perfect; but no straight line is perfect: neither an
infinite straight line, for in order to be perfect, it must have an end
and a boundary; nor any finite straight line, for each has something
without it and may be prolonged at pleasure. So that, if motion first by
 nature belong to a body first by nature, if circular motion (as being
perfect) be prior to rectilinear motion, and if rectilinear motion
belong to a first or a simple body, as we see both in fire and in earth,
 — we may be sure <i>à fortiori</i> that circular motion belongs to a
simple body, and that there is, besides the four elements here, prior to
 them and more divine than them, a different body cf special nature and
essence. Indeed, since circular motion is against the nature of these
four elements, there must be some other different body to whose nature
it is conformable. There must thus be some simple and primary body,
whose nature it is to be carried round in a circle, as earth is carried
downwards and fire upwards. On the assumption that the revolving bodies
revolved against their own nature, it would be wonderful and even
unreasonable that this one single mode of motion, being thus contrary to
 nature, should be continuous and eternal; for in all other things we
see that what is contrary to nature dies away most speedily. Now, if the
 revolving body were fire, as some affirm, the revolving motion would be
 just as much contrary to its nature as motion downwards; for the
natural motion of fire is upwards or away from the centre. Reasoning
from all these premisses, we may safely conclude that, distinct from all
 these bodies which are here around us, there exists a body whose nature
 is more honourable in proportion to its greater distance from us here
(ss. 1-13).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 3. — We plainly cannot affirm that every
body is either heavy or light: meaning by heavy, that which is carried
by its nature downwards or towards the centre; by light, that which is
carried by its nature upwards or away from the centre. Heaviest (or
earth) is that which underlies all other downward moving bodies,
lightest (fire) is that which floats above all upward moving bodies. Air
 and water are both light and heavy, relatively, but relatively to
different terms of comparison; thus, water is heavy as compared to air
and fire, light as compared to earth. But that body whose nature it is
to revolve in a circle, cannot possibly have either heaviness or levity;
 for it cannot move in a right line, either upwards or downwards, nor
either by nature or against nature. Not by nature, for, in that case, it
 must be identical with some one of the four elements; not against
nature, because, if it moved upwards against nature, this would prove
that motion downwards was conformable to its nature, and it would thus
be identical with earth: we have already seen that, if a body moves
upwards against nature, it must move downwards according to nature, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
 Now the same natural motion which belongs to any body as a whole,
belongs also to its minute fragments (to the whole earth and to any of
its constituent clods). Accordingly the revolving body in its local
movement of revolution cannot possibly be dragged in any other
direction, either upward or downward, — neither the whole nor any
portion thereof. It is alike reasonable to conceive it as ungenerable,
indestructible, incapable both of increase and of qualitative change
(&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#958;&#8050;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;). It cannot be generated, because every thing
generated comes out of a substratum and an opposite, into which it
relapses on being destroyed. Now the revolving body has no opposite; for
 we have already seen that opposite bodies have their currents of motion
 opposite, and there is no current of motion opposite to that of
circular rotation. Nature has rightly excepted this ungenerable and
indestructible substance from the action of contraries, in which
generation and destruction occur. It is also incapable of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page632" id="page632"></a>632</span>increase
 or diminution, because these processes take place through the accession
 of new cognate materials; and in this case there are none such. It is
farther incapable of qualitative change, because this always implies the
 being affected favourably or unfavourably (&#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;); and this last never
takes place, in plants or in animals, without some increase or
diminution in quantity (ss. 1-5).</p>
<p>
This Celestial Substance is thus eternal, ungenerable, indestructible,
noway increased nor diminished, neither growing old nor capable of
disturbing affections nor changeable in quality. Herein the evidence of
reason and that of phenomena concur. For all men, Hellenes and
Barbarians, have some belief respecting the Gods, and all who believe
Gods to exist assign to the divine nature the uppermost place in the
Kosmos; an immortal place going naturally along with immortal persons.
Our perceptions confirm this sufficiently, at least when we speak with
reference to human belief. For not the smallest change has ever been
observed in the celestial substance, throughout all past time. Under
these impressions, the ancients gave to it the name which it now bears;
for the same opinions suggest themselves to us not once, nor twice, but
an infinite number of times<span class="correction" title="stop omitted">.</span>
 Hence the ancients, regarding the First Body as something distinct from
 Fire, Earth, Air, or Water, called the uppermost place Æther, from its
being always running (&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#949;&#943;), the adverbial designation being
 derived from eternal duration. Anaxagoras employs this name improperly:
 he calls Fire by the name of Æther (s. 6).</p>
<p>
It is plain, from all we have said, that the simple bodies cannot be
more in number than those just indicated; for a simple body must of
necessity have a simple mode of motion, and there are only three simple
modes of motion — one circular and two rectilinear, one of these being
from the centre, the other towards the centre (s. 7).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 4. — That Circular Rotation has no motion
 opposed to it, may be shown by several different arguments. If there
were any, it would certainly be rectilinear motion; for convex and
concave, though each respectively opposed to the other, are, when both
put together, opposed as a couple to rectilinear motion. But each
variety of rectilinear motion has another variety of rectilinear motion
opposed to it; and each thing has but one opposite. Moreover the
oppositions between one motion (or one current — &#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;) and another are
founded upon oppositions of place, which are three in number: (1) Above
and Below; (2) Before and Behind; (3) Right and Left. Now the motion in
circular rotation <span class="correction" title="amended from 'from from'">from</span>
 A to B is not opposite to that from B to A: the opposition of motion is
 along the straight line which joins the two; for an infinite number of
different circles may be drawn, not interfering with each other but all
passing through the same two points A and B. In the same circle, the
opposition between the current from A to B and that from B to A, is
along the line of diameter — not along the line of circumference. If one
 circular current were really opposed to any other circular current, one
 or other of the two would have existed to no purpose; for both have the
 same object. That is to say: what is carried round in a circle, let it
begin from any point whatever, must necessarily come round equally to
all the opposite places, above, below, before, behind, right, left. If
the two (presumed) opposite circular currents were equal, they would
neutralize each other, and there would be no motion at all of either of
them. If one of the two were the more powerful, it would extinguish the
other; so that to suppose the existence of both is to suppose that one
or both exists in vain (<i>i.e.</i>, can never be realized). We say that
 a sandal exists in vain (&#956;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#957;), when it cannot be fastened on. But God
 and nature do nothing in vain (ss. 1-8).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 5. — Most of the ancient philosophers
admitted an infinite body; but this may be shown to be impossible. The
question is very important; for the consequences which follow from
admitting the Infinite as principium, affect our speculations concerning
 the whole of Nature (s. 1).</p>
<p>
Every body is of necessity either simple or compound. The infinite body
therefore, if it exists, must of necessity be either one or the other.
But there can be no infinite compound composed of simple bodies finite
in magnitude and in number: so that, if an infinite body exist, it must
be simple. We shall first enquire whether the First Body, whose nature
it is to move in a circle, can be infinite in magnitude. Now, if it were
 infinite, the radii thrown out from the centre would be infinite, and
the distance between them would also be infinite; that is, no finite
peripheral line can be found touching all the extremities of the radii
without: if any such line be assumed, you may always assume a greater.
We call Number infinite, because the greatest number cannot be given;
and the like may be said about this distance. Now, as an infinite
distance cannot be passed over, no circular motion passing over it is
possible, so as to come round to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id="page633"></a>633</span>point
 of departure. But we see plainly that the First Body or the Heaven does
 come round in a circle; and it has been shown by reasoning <i>à priori</i> that there <i>is</i>
 a variety of body whose nature it is to move in a circle. Such a body
therefore as the First (revolving) Body cannot be infinite (ss. 2, 3).</p>
<p>
Four other arguments are added, proving the same conclusion (s. 4,
seq.). One of them is: That an infinite square, circle, or sphere, is an
 impossibility; each of these figures being defined or determined. As
there can be no infinite circle, so neither can an infinite body be
moved round in a circle (s. 7).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 6. — As the First Body cannot be
infinite, so neither can those bodies be infinite whose nature it is to
move to the centre and from the centre — neither the centripetal nor the
 centrifugal body. For these two currents are opposite in nature;
opposite currents being characterized by the opposite places to which
they tend. But of two opposites, if the one be fixed and determinate,
the other must be fixed and determinate also. Now the centre is
determined; for the centripetal body, let it fall from what height it
will, can never fall lower than the centre; and, since the centre is
determined, the upper region or extremity must also be determined. The
places at each extreme being thus determined, the intermediate space
must be determined also; otherwise there would exist motion undetermined
 or infinite, which has been shown in a former treatise to be impossible
 (Physica, VIII. viii.); and therefore that body which either is
therein, or may possibly be therein, must be determined. But it is a
fact that the centripetal body and the centrifugal body can be therein;
for centripetality and centrifugality are of the nature of each
respectively (ss. 1, 2).</p>
<p>
Hence we see that there can be no infinite body. There are other reasons
 also. As the centripetal body is heavy, if it be infinite, its gravity
must also be infinite; and, if gravity cannot be infinite, neither can
any heavy body be infinite. The like about any light body, such as the
centrifugal (s. 3).</p>
<p>
He then shows (by a long process of reasoning, not easy to follow)
first, that there cannot be an infinite body with finite gravity; next,
that there can be no infinite gravity. Accordingly there can be no
infinite body at all, having gravity. At the end, he considers that this
 is established, (1) by the partial arguments (&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#962;)
immediately preceding; (2) by the general reasonings in his other
treatises respecting first principles, in which he explained the
Infinite — in what sense it existed and did not exist; (3) by an
argument about the Infinite, upon which he touches in the next chapter
(ss. 4-13).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 7. — Every body is of necessity either
infinite or finite. If infinite, it is as a whole either of like
constituents or of unlike. If the latter, either of a finite number of
species, or of an infinite number. The last is impossible, if our
fundamental assumptions are allowed to stand. For since the simple modes
 of motion are limited in number, the simple bodies must be alike
limited; each simple mode of notion belonging to its own special simple
body, and each natural body having always its own natural motion. But,
if the Infinite be composed of a finite number of species, each of these
 constituent parts must be infinite; that is, water and fire must be
infinite. Yet this too, is impossible; for we have seen that there
cannot be either infinite levity or infinite gravity (the attributes of
fire and water). Moreover, if these bodies be infinite, the places which
 they occupy, and the motions which they make, must also be infinite;
but this also we have shown to be inadmissible, if our fundamental
assumptions are admitted. The centripetal body cannot be carried to an
infinite distance downward, nor the centrifugal body to an infinite
distance upward. That which cannot come to pass, cannot be in course of
coming to pass; thus, if a thing cannot come to be white, or a cubit
long, or domiciled in Egypt, it cannot be in course of becoming white,
or a cubit long, &amp;c. It cannot be in course of being carried to a
terminus which cannot be reached. It might be argued that fire, though
discontinuous and dispersed, might still be infinite, in the sum total
of its different masses. But body is that which is extended in every
direction: how can there be many bodies unlike to each other, yet each
of them infinite? Each of them, if infinite at all, ought to be infinite
 in every direction (ss. 1-5).</p>
<p>
We thus see that the Infinite cannot consist of unlike constituents. But
 neither can it consist of constituents all similar. For, first, there
are only three simple motions, and one of the three it must have; but we
 have shown that it cannot have either centripetal or centrifugal motion
 (<i>i.e.</i>, that it cannot have either infinite gravity or infinite
levity); nor can it again have circular motion, for the Infinite cannot
be carried in a circle: this would amount to saying that the Heaven is
infinite, which we have shown to be impossible. The Infinite indeed
cannot be moved in any way at all; for, if moved, it must be moved
either according to nature, or contrary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id="page634"></a>634</span>to
 nature (violently), and, if its present motion be violent, it must have
 some other mode of motion which is natural to it. But, if it have any
such, this assumes that there exists some other place belonging to it,
into which it may be conveyed — an obvious impossibility (ss. 6, 7).</p>
<p>
Farthermore, the Infinite cannot act in any way upon the Finite, nor be
acted upon thereby (ss. 8-10). Nor can the Infinite be acted upon in any
 way by the Infinite (ss. 11-12).</p>
<p>
If then every perceptible body possesses powers, as agent or patient or
both, there can be no perceptible body which is infinite. But all bodies
 which are in any place are perceptible; therefore no body which is in
any place can be infinite. There is no infinite body, indeed there can
be no body at all, outside of the Heaven; for that which is outside of
the Heaven is in a place. Even if perceivable only up to a certain point
 (&#956;&#941;&#967;&#961;&#953; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;), even if merely intelligible, it would still be in a
place, and would therefore come under the foregoing argument — that
there is no body outside of the Heaven (ss. 13, 14).</p>
<p>
The foregoing reasoning may be summed up, in more general language
(&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;), as follows:— The Infinite assumed as homogeneous cannot
be moved in a circle, since the Infinite has no centre; nor in a
straight line, since this would imply a second infinite place into which
 it must be moved according to nature, and a third infinite place into
which it must be moved against nature, and since in either case the
force which causes it to be moved must be infinite. But we have already
argued, in treating of Motion (Phys. VIII. x.) that nothing finite can
have infinite power, nothing infinite can have finite power; and, if
that which is moved according to nature can also be moved contrary to
nature, there must of necessity be two Infinites — Movens and Motum. Yet
 what can that be which causes the Infinite to move? If it cause itself
to move, it must be animated (&#7956;&#956;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#957;): but how can an infinite animated
 being (&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957;) exist? And, if there be anything else which causes it to
move, there must exist two Infinites, each distinguished from the other
in form and power (ss. 15-17).</p>
<p>
Again, even if we admit the doctrine of Leukippus and Demokritus — That
the whole is not continuous, but discontinuous, atoms divided by
intervening spaces — still the Infinite is inadmissible. For the nature
and essence of these atoms is all the same, though they are different
from each other in figure and arrangement; accordingly the motion of all
 must be the same: if one is heavy or centripetal, all must be so alike;
 if one is light or centrifugal, all must be so alike. But either of
these motions would imply the existence of centre and periphery; which
does not consist with an infinite whole. In the Infinite, there is
neither centre nor periphery; no terminus prefixed either for upward or
downward motion; no <i>own place</i> either for centripetal or centrifugal matter. Therefore in an infinite universe, there can be no motion at all (ss. 18, 19).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 8. — There cannot be more than one
Kosmos. All things both rest and are moved, either by violence, or
according to nature. In that place to which it is carried by nature, it
also rests by nature: in that place to which it is carried by violence,
it rests by violence. If the current which we see towards the centre is
by violence, the opposite current must be natural; if earth is carried
by violence from thence hitherward, its natural current must be from
hence thitherward; and, if being here it rests without violence, its
current towards here must be a natural one. For there is one only which
is natural. Now, if there be many Kosmi, they must be alike in their
nature, and must be composed of the same bodies, having the same nature
and powers — fire, earth, and the two intermediate elements: for, if the
 bodies here are not the same as those in other Kosmi — if the same
names are given in an equivocal sense and do not connote the same
specific attributes — the name Kosmos must be equivocal also, and there
cannot be many true or real Kosmi, in the same sense. To the parts or
elements of each Kosmos, therefore, the centripetal and <span class="correction" title="amended from 'contrifugal'">centrifugal</span>
 currents are natural; for the simple currents are limited in number,
and each element is so named as to connote one of them specially; and,
if the currents are the same, the elements must also be the same
everywhere. If there were another Kosmos, the earth in that would tend
towards the centre of our Kosmos, and the fire in that would tend
towards the periphery of our Kosmos. But this is impossible; since in
that case the earth in that Kosmos would run away from the centre of its
 own Kosmos, and the fire therein would run away from its own periphery.
 Either we must not admit the same nature in the simple elements of the
numerous Kosmi; or, if we do admit it, we must recognize only one centre
 and one periphery. This difficulty prevents our recognizing more than
one Kosmos (ss. 1-6).</p>
<p>
It is unphilosophical to affirm that the nature of these simple elements becomes changed according as they are more or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id="page635"></a>635</span>less distant from their own places. The difference is at best one of degree, not one of kind. That they <i>are</i>
 moved, we see plainly; there must therefore be some one current of
motion natural to them. Accordingly every portion of the same element
(or of elements the same in kind) must tend towards the same numerical
place — towards this actual centre (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;), or that actual
periphery; and, if the tendency be towards one centre <i>specie</i>, but towards many centres <i>numero</i>, because particulars differ <i>numero</i> alone, and not <i>specie</i>,
 still the attribute will be alike in all, and will not be present in
some portions, absent in others: I mean that, if the portions of this
Kosmos are relative to each other, those in another Kosmos are in the
like condition, and what is taken from this Kosmos will not be different
 from what is taken from the corresponding elements of any other Kosmos.
 Unless these assumptions can be overthrown, it is indisputably certain
that there can be only one centre and one periphery; by consequence
therefore, only one Kosmos and not more (ss. 7-10).</p>
<p>
There are other reasons to show that there is a given terminus for the
natural current both of fire and of earth. A thing moved, speaking
generally, changes from something definite into something else definite;
 but there are different species of such change: the change called
getting-well is from sickness to health; that called growth is from the
little to great; that called local movement is from a terminus to
another terminus, and local movements are specifically different from
each other, according as the terminus <i>a quo</i> and the terminus <i>ad quem</i>
 is defined in each. The terminus is always a known and definite point:
it is not accidental, nor dependent upon the arbitrium of the mover.
Fire and earth therefore do not move on to infinity, but to definite
points in opposite directions; and the local antithesis is between above
 and below: these are the two termini of the respective currents. Earth
is carried with greater velocity, the nearer it approaches to the
centre; fire is carried with greater velocity, the nearer it approaches
to the periphery. This shows that its current does not stretch to
infinity; for its velocity would then increase infinitely. Earth is not
carried downward by the force of any thing else, nor fire upwards: not
by any violence, nor by squeezing out (&#7952;&#954;&#952;&#955;&#943;&#968;&#949;&#953;), as some say. If this
were so, a larger quantity of earth would move downward, and a larger
quantity of fire upward, more slowly than a smaller. But the reverse is
what occurs: the larger quantity of earth moves downward more rapidly
than the smaller; if its motion had been caused by violence or by
squeezing out, such motion would have slackened as it became more widely
 distant from the moving force (ss. 11-14).</p>
<p>
We may deduce the same conclusion from the reasonings of the First
Philosophy, also from the fact of circular motion which of necessity is
constant both here and everywhere. Further, it is clear that there can
be only one Kosmos; for, as there are three bodily elements, so there
are three special places of such elements: one the undermost, at the
centre; another the uppermost, at the periphery, revolving in a circular
 orbit; the third, in the intermediate place between the two, being the
light or floating element (&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#957;); for, if not there, it must be
 outside of the Kosmos, which is impossible (ss. 15, 16).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 9. — We must however now examine some
reasons, which have been alleged to prove the contrary; and which seem
to show, not only that there are many Kosmi, but even that there <i>must</i>
 be many, and that the hypothesis of one single Kosmos is inadmissible.
It is urged that in all aggregates, natural as well as artificial, the
Form by itself is one thing, and the Form implicated with Matter is
another. When we declare the definition of a sphere or a circle, we do
not include therein gold or brass, for this makes no part of the
essence: if we mention these metals, it is when we cannot conceive or
grasp anything beyond the particular case; for example, if we have one
particular circle before us. Nevertheless, even here the circle in the
abstract is one thing, and this particular circle is another: the first
is the Form by itself, the last is the Form along with Matter, one among
 particular objects. Now, since the Heaven is perceivable by sense, it
must be one among particular objects; for every thing perceivable is
implicated with Matter. As such, it is <i>this</i> Heaven: to be <i>this</i>
 Heaven (Form along with Matter) is one thing; to be the Heaven simply
and absolutely (Form without Matter) is another. Now, wherever there is
Form, there either are or may be many distinct particulars; whether we
admit (with Plato) that the Forms exist separately, or not. In all
things where the Essence is implicated with Matter, we see that the
particular manifestations are many and of indefinite number. Upon this
reasoning therefore, there are or at least may be many Heavens: the
supposition that there can be no more than one, is inadmissible (ss.
1-2).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id="page636"></a>636</span>But
we must see how far this reasoning will hold. That the Form without
Matter differs from the Form with Matter, is perfectly true. But this
does not show that there must be many Kosmi; nor can there be many, if
this one Kosmos exhausts all the matter that exists. If the matter of
man were flesh and bone, and if a single man were formed, including all
flesh and all bone indissolubly united; there could not possibly exist
any other man; and the like is true about other objects; for, where the
essence is implicated with an underlying matter, no object can come into
 existence unless some matter be furnished. The Kosmos, or Heaven, is a
particular object, composed partly out of appropriate matter: but if it
absorbs all the appropriate matter, no second Kosmos can come to pass.
We shall now show that it does include all the appropriate matter (ss.
3-5).</p>
<p>
The word Heaven has three different senses. 1. It means the essence of
the extreme periphery of the universe, or the natural body which is
there situated: we call this highest and farthest place Heaven, where we
 suppose all the divine agency to be situated (&#7952;&#957; &#8103; &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#957;
&#7985;&#948;&#961;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#943; &#966;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;). 2. It means the body continuous (&#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#8050;&#962; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;) with
the extreme periphery of the universe, wherein are contained Sun, Moon,
and some of the Stars (Planets); for these we affirm to be in the
Heaven. 3. In a third sense, it means the body circumscribed
(&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;) by this extreme periphery: for we usually call the Whole
and the Universe, Heaven. — These being the three senses of Heaven, the
Whole circumscribed by the extreme periphery must by necessity consist
of all the natural and perceivable body existing, since there neither is
 nor can be any such outside of the Heaven. For, if there were any such
outside of the Heaven, it must be either one of the elements or a
compound thereof — either by nature or contrary to nature. For we have
shown that each of the three elements — the circular, the centrifugal,
and the centripetal — has its own special place by nature; and that,
even if the place in which it now is were not its natural place, that
place would be the natural place of another one among the three; for, if
 a place be contrary to nature in reference to one, it must be
conformable to nature in reference to another. Neither of these three
elements therefore can be outside of the Heaven, nor, of course, any of
their compounds. And there exists no other body besides these; nor can <span class="correction" title="amended from 'their'">there</span> exist any other (ss. 6, 7).</p>
<p>
We see therefore plainly that there neither is nor can be any mass of
body (&#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8004;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#957;) outside of the Heaven; and that the Heaven
comprehends all matter — all body natural and perceptible. So that there
 neither are, nor ever have been, nor ever can be, many Heavens: this
one is unique as well as perfect. Nor is there either place, or vacuum,
or time, outside of the Heaven. There is no place or vacuum; because, if
 there were, body might be placed therein; which we have shown to be
impossible. There is no time; because time is the number of motion, and
there can be no motion without some natural body; but there cannot exist
 any extra-celestial body. Neither, therefore, are the things outside of
 the Heaven in place, nor is there time to affect them with old age, nor
 do they undergo change of any kind. They are without any change of
quality and without susceptibility of suffering; they remain, throughout
 the entire Æon, in possession of the best and most self-sufficing life.
 The word Æon is a divine expression proposed (&#952;&#949;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#966;&#952;&#949;&#947;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#953;) by the
ancient philosophers: they call the Æon of each creature that end which
circumscribes the natural duration of the creature’s life. Pursuant to
this same explanation, the end of the whole Heaven — the end comprising
all time and the infinity of all things — is Æon, so denominated &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
 <span class="correction" title="amended from '&#7936;&#949;&#8150;'">&#7936;&#949;&#8054;</span> &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;,
immortal and divine. From this is suspended existence and life for all
other things; for some closely and strictly, for others faintly and
feebly. For it is a doctrine often repeated to us in ordinary
philosophical discourse (&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;) respecting
divine matters — that the Divine, every thing primary and supreme, is by
 necessity unchangeable; and this confirms what has been just affirmed.
For there exists nothing more powerful than itself which can cause it to
 be moved (if there were, <i>that</i> would be more divine); nor has it
any mean attribute; nor is it deficient in any of the perfections
belonging to its nature. Its unceasing motion too is easily explained.
For all things cease to be moved, when they come into their own place;
but with the circular or revolving body the place in which it begins and
 in which it ends is the same (ss. 8-10).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 10. — We shall next discuss whether the
Kosmos be generable or ungenerable, and perishable or imperishable;
noticing what others have said on the subject before. All of them
consider the Kosmos to be generated: but some think it (although
generated) to be eternal; others look upon it as perishable, like other
natural compounds; others again — Empedokles and Herakleitus — declare <span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id="page637"></a>637</span>it
 to be generated and destroyed in perpetual alternation. Now to affirm
that it is generated and yet that it is eternal, is an impossibility: we
 cannot reasonably affirm any thing, except what we see to happen with
all things or with most things; and, in the case before us, what happens
 is the very reverse of the foregoing affirmation, for all things
generated are seen to be destroyed. Again that which has no beginning of
 being as it is now — that which cannot possibly have been otherwise
previously throughout the whole Æon — can never by any possibility
change; for, if it could ever change, there must exist some cause,
which, if it had existed before, would have compelled what is assumed to
 be incapable of being otherwise, to be otherwise. To those who say that
 the Kosmos has come together from materials previously existing in
another condition, we may reply<span class="correction" title="amended from ';'">:</span>
 If these materials were always in this prior condition and incapable of
 any other, the Kosmos would never have been generated at all; and, if
it <i>has</i> been generated, we may be sure that the antecedent
materials must have been capable of coming into another condition, and
were not under a necessity to remain always in the same condition; so
that aggregations once existing were dissolved, and disgregations
brought into combination, many times over before the present Kosmos; at
least they possibly may have been so: and this is enough to prove that
the Kosmos is not indestructible (ss. 1-3).</p>
<p>
Among those who maintain the Kosmos to have been generated yet to be
indestructible, there are some who defend themselves in the following
manner. They tell us that the generation of which they speak is not
meant to be affirmed as a real past fact, but is a mere explanatory or
illustrative fiction, like the generation of a geometrical figure,
introduced to facilitate the understanding by pupils. But such an
analogy cannot be admitted. For in geometry the conclusions are just the
 same, if we suppose all the figures existing simultaneously; but it is
not so with the demonstrations which they tender about the generation of
 the Cosmos, where the antecedent condition and the consequent condition
 are the reverse of each other. Out of disorder (they tell us) things
came into order: these two conditions cannot be simultaneous; generation
 must be a real fact, and distinction of time comparing the one
condition with the other; whereas in geometrical figures no distinction
of time is required (ss. 4-6).</p>
<p>
To assume alternate generation and dissolution, over and over again, is
in fact to represent the Kosmos as eternal, but as changing its form; as
 if you should suppose the same person to pass from boyhood to manhood
and then back again from manhood to boyhood — calling that by the name
of generation and destruction. For, if the elements come together, the
aggregation resulting will not be accidental and variable but always the
 same, especially upon the assumptions of these philosophers. So that,
if the whole Kosmos, remaining continuous, is sometimes arranged in one
way, sometimes in another, it is these arrangements which are generated
and destroyed, not the Kosmos itself (ss. 7, 8).</p>
<p>
Total generation, and total destruction without any renovation, of
Kosmos might be possible, if there were an infinity of Kosmi, but cannot
 be possible with only one; for anterior to the moment of generation
there existed the antecedent condition, which, never having been
generated, could not be destroyed (s. 9).</p>
<p>
There are some who think (with Plato in Timæus) that the non-generable
may yet be destroyed, and that the generated may be indestructible. We
have combated this opinion on physical grounds, respecting the Heaven
specially. We shall now treat the subject upon universal reasonings (<i>i.e.</i>,
 belonging to Logic or Metaphysics — &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#959;&#8019;&#962; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;· &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#954;&#949;&#968;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#8134;&#955;&#959;&#957; — s. 10).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 11. — In this reasoning, the first step
is to point out that Generable and Non-Generable, Destructible or
Indestructible, are words used in many different senses, which must be
discriminated (&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;). If a man uses these words in an
affirmative proposition without such discrimination, his affirmation is
indeterminate; you cannot tell in which of their many different senses
he intends to affirm. Non-Generable means: (1) That which now is, having
 previously not been, even though without either generation or change,
as, to touch or to be moved; for, according to some persons, touching or
 being moved are not cases of generation; you cannot become touching, or
 become moved; you are moved, or you are not moved; you touch, or you do
 not touch (&#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#943; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7937;&#960;&#964;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;. He
means, I presume, that to touch, and to be moved, are instantaneous
acts, though how they can be said to occur &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8134;&#962;, I do not
see.). It means: (2) That which, though capable of coming to pass or of
having come to pass (&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#7970; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;), nevertheless is
not; for this too is non-generable, since it might have come to be.
Again, it means: (3) That which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page638" id="page638"></a>638</span>cannot
 by possibility sometimes exist, sometimes not exist. Impossible has two
 meanings: (1) That of which you cannot truly say that it might be
generated (&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#964;’ &#7940;&#957;); (2) That which cannot be generated easily,
or quickly, or well (&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962;). So also the Generable (&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;) means:
(1) That which, not existing previously, afterwards exists at one time
and not at another, whether generated or not (he seems here to point to
&#964;&#8056; &#7941;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; or &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;); (2) The possible, whether it be the
strictly possible, or the easily possible; (3) That of which there is
generation out of the nonexistent into existence, whether it now does
actually exist, or may exist hereafter. The Destructible and
Indestructible (&#966;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#957;) have similar differences of
meaning (ss. 1-6).</p>
<p>
If we say that a man can raise a weight of 100 pounds, or march 100
stadia, we speak always with reference to a certain extreme, meaning to
imply that he can also raise a weight of 50, 40, 30 pounds, and that he
can also walk 50, 40, 30 stadia. If we say that he cannot raise a weight
 of 100 pounds, we mean to imply, <i>à fortiori</i>, that he cannot
raise a weight of 110 pounds. In regard to sight and hearing, the case
is opposite; he who can see a small object, can certainly see a large
one; he who can hear a faint sound, can certainly hear a loud one. But
he who can see a large object, is not necessarily able to see a small
one; he who can hear a loud sound, is not necessarily able to hear a
faint one. In sight and hearing, superior power is indicated by the less
 including the greater; in motion, by the greater including the less
(ss. 7-8).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 12. — If there are some things capable
both of existence and of nonexistence, we must define on which falls the
 major portion of time; for, if we cannot in either case define the
time, and can only say that it is greater than any assumed length of
time and never less than any assumed length, — the same thing will be
capable both of existence and of non-existence for an infinite time;
which is an impossibility. We must take our departure from this
principle: Impossibility is one thing, Falsehood another. Both the
impossible and the false are, however, either conditional (as when it is
 said to be impossible that the triangle should have its three angles
equal to two right angles, if such and such things are granted, and that
 the diameter should be commensurate with the periphery, if such and
such positions were true), or absolute. But there are matters absolutely
 false, which are not absolutely impossible. When you are standing, I
affirm that you are sitting: this is absolutely false, but not
absolutely impossible. On the other hand, if I affirm that you are at
the same time sitting and standing, or that the diameter is
commensurable with the periphery, the proposition is not merely
absolutely false, but absolutely impossible. An assumption simply false
is not the same thing as an assumption absolutely impossible: from an
impossible assumption there follow other impossibilities. The power of
sitting or standing means that you can do either one at any given time —
 one at one time, the other at another; but not that you can do both at
the same time. But, if any thing has throughout an infinite time the
power of doing more things than one, it must have the power of doing
more things than one at the same time; for this infinite time
comprehends its whole existence. Accordingly, if any thing existing for
an infinite time is nevertheless destructible, this means that it has
the possibility not to exist. This being a possibility, let us imagine
it realized: then the thing in question will both exist actually for an
infinite time and yet not exist; which is a consequence not only false,
but impossible, and thus proves the premiss assumed to be impossible (<i>i.e.</i>,
 that a thing existing for an infinite time is nevertheless
destructible). We thus see that what exists always is absolutely
indestructible (ss. 1-3). It is also ungenerable; for, if generable,
there will be a possibility that at some time or other it did not exist.
 That is generable, which may possibly have not existed at some anterior
 time, finite or infinite: so that, if &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#8004;&#957; cannot possibly not
exist, it cannot be generable. Now that which is always possible to
exist, has, for its correlate negative (&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;), that which is not
always possible to exist; and that which is always possible not to
exist, has, for its contrary, that which is not always possible not to
exist. These two negatives must of necessity be true of the same
subject: there must be something of which we may truly say — It has no
possibility always to exist — It has no possibility always not to exist.
 This therefore is something intermediate between that which always
exists, and that which always exists not, viz., That which may exist and
 may not exist (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#964;&#8056;
&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;); for both the negative predicates will
find application, if it do not exist always. The possible to exist, and
the possible not to exist, must therefore be the same thing — a mean
between the two above-mentioned extremes (ss. 4, 5).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page639" id="page639"></a>639</span>After a long metaphysical deduction, occupying from sections 6 to 17, Aristotle proceeds as follows.</p>
<p>
We may also discern in the following manner that nothing which has been
once generated, can continue indestructible; nothing which is
ungenerable and which always existed heretofore, can ever be destroyed.
For it is impossible that any thing which arises spontaneously (&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;) can be either indestructible or ungenerable. The Spontaneous,
 and the Casual (&#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#962;), are in antithesis to the always or
the most frequently Ens or Fiens (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#8058; &#7970; &#8002;&#957;
 &#7970; &#947;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; — s. 18); but that which has existed for an infinite or a
very long tine, must belong to this last category. Accordingly, such
things must by nature sometimes exist, sometimes not exist. In them,
both sides of the contradiction are alike true, owing to the matter of
which they are composed: they exist, and they do not exist. But you
cannot say with truth now that the thing exists last year; nor could you
 say last year that it exists now. Having once been non-existent, it
cannot be eternal for future time; for it will still possess in future
time the possibility of non-existence, yet not the power of non-existing
 at the moment when it does exist, nor with reference to last year and
to past time; there being no power bearing upon past time, but only on
present and future time. (Sections 21 and 22 are hardly intelligible to
me.)</p>
<p>
On physical grounds also it appears impossible that what is eternal in
the past should be destroyed afterwards, or that what did not exist at
some former time should afterwards be eternal. Those things which are
destructible, are all of them generable and changeable (&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#969;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;). Those things which exist by nature, are changed by
their opposites and by their component materials, and are destroyed by
the same agencies (s. 23).</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Book II.</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 1. — The Heaven has not been generated
 nor can it be destroyed, as some (Plato) affirm: it is one and eternal,
 having neither beginning nor end of the whole Æon, holding and
comprehending in itself infinite time. This we may believe not merely
from the foregoing reasonings, but also from the opinion of opponents
who suppose the Cosmos to be generated. For, since their opinion has
been shown to be inadmissible, and our doctrine is at least admissible,
even thus much will have great force to determine our faith in the
immortality and eternity of the Heaven. Hence we shall do well to assist
 in persuading ourselves that the ancient doctrines, and especially
those of our own country, are true — That there is among the substances
endowed with motion one immortal and divine, whose motion is such that
it has itself no limit but is rather itself the limit of all other
motions, limit being the attribute of the circumscribing substance. The
circular motion of the Heaven, being itself perfect, circumscribes and
comprehends all the imperfect motions which are subject to limit and
cessation. It has itself neither beginning nor end, but is unceasing
throughout infinite time: in regard to other motions, it is the
initiatory cause to some, while it is the recipient of the cessation of
others (ss. 1, 2).</p>
<p>
The ancients assigned Heaven to the Gods, as the only place which was
immortal, and our reasonings show that it is not merely indestructible
and ungenerable, but also unsusceptible of all mortal defect or
discomfort. Moreover it feels no fatigue, because it is not constrained
by any extraneous force to revolve contrary to its own nature: if it
were so, that would be tiresome, and all the more since the motion is
eternal; it would be inconsistent with any supremely good condition. The
 ancients therefore were mistaken in saying that the Heaven required to
be supported by a person named Atlas: the authors of this fable
proceeded upon the same supposition as recent philosophers; regarding
the celestial body as heavy and earthy, they placed under it, in
mythical guise, an animated necessity (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;&#957; &#7956;&#956;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#957;), or constraint
arising from vital force. But they are wrong; and so is Empedokles, when
 he says that the Heaven is kept permanently in its place by extreme
velocity of rotation, which counteracts its natural inclination
downwards (&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#8165;&#959;&#960;&#8134;&#962;). Nor can we reasonably suppose that it is kept
 eternally in its place (<i>i.e.</i>, contrary to its own nature) by the
 compulsion of a soul or vital force (&#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#951;&#962;): it is
impossible that the life of a soul thus acting can be painless or happy.
 The motion which it causes, being accompanied with violence and being
also perpetual (as it is the nature of the First Body to cause motion
continuously throughout the Kosmos), must be a tiresome duty, unrelieved
 by any reasonable relaxation; since this soul enjoys no repose, such as
 the letting down of the body during sleep affords to the soul of mortal
 animals, but is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page640" id="page640"></a>640</span>subjected
 to a fate like Ixion’s — ceaseless and unyielding revolution. Now our
reasonings, if admissible, respecting the First or Circular Motion
(&#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#966;&#959;&#961;&#8118;&#962;) afford not merely more harmonious conceptions respecting
its eternity, but also the only way of speaking in language which will
be allowed as consistent with the vague impressions respecting the Deity
 (&#964;&#8135; &#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#8115; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;). Enough, however, of this talk for the
present (ss. 3-6).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 2. — Since the Pythagoreans and others
recognize a Right and Left in the Heaven, let us enquire whether such
&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943; can properly be ascribed to the body of the Universe; for, if
these can be ascribed, much more may the other &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943; prior to them be
ascribed to it. Of &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; (<i>termini a quibus</i>), there are
three couples: (1) Upwards and Downwards; (2) Forward and Backward; (3)
Right and Left. All the three exist in animals; but the first alone is
found in plants. All the three are in all perfect bodies, and in all
animated bodies which have in themselves a beginning of motion; but not
in inanimate bodies, which have not in themselves a beginning. Each of
these three &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943; or &#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; is true and appropriate as an attribute;
 but among the three, Upwards and Downwards comes first in the order of
nature, Right and Left, last. The Pythagoreans are to be blamed for
dwelling on Right and Left, and not noticing the other two pairs which
are prior in the order of nature and more appropriate, and for supposing
 that Right and Left are to be found in every thing. Upward is the
principle of length; Right, of breadth; Forward, of depth. Again, from
upward movement comes growth; movement from the right is local movement;
 movement from before is movement of sense (&#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;), or the
 line in which sensible impressions are propagated (&#7952;&#966;’ &#8103; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;). Up
 is the source from whence motion originates (&#964;&#8056; &#8005;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#7969; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; — s. 6);
 Right, the point from which the direction of the motion starts;
Forward, the point towards which it goes (&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#966;’ &#8005;). In inanimate bodies
 (which are either not moved at all, or only moved in one manner and
direction, as fire only upwards, earth only downwards), we speak of
above and below, right and left, only with reference to ourselves, and
not as attributes really belonging to these objects; for by inverting
the objects these attributes will be inverted also, right will become
left, and left will become right. But in animated objects, which have in
 themselves an &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;, a real right and left, a real upward and
downward, are to be recognized: of course therefore in the Heaven, which
 is an animated object of this character (&#7956;&#956;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#962;). For we must not make
 any difficulty in consequence of the spherical figure of the universe,
or suppose that such a figure excludes real right and left, the parts
being all alike and all in perpetual motion. We must conceive the case
as like that of a person having a real right and left, distinct in
attributes, but who has been enclosed in a hollow sphere: he will still
have the real distinct right and left, yet to a spectator outside he
will appear not to have it. In like manner, we must speak of the Heaven
as having a beginning of motion; for, though its motion never did begin,
 yet there must be some point from which it would have taken its
departure, if it ever had begun, and from which it would recommence, if
it ever came to a standstill. I call the length of the Heaven, the
distance between the poles — one of the poles above, the other below.
Now the pole which is above us, is the lower pole; that which is
invisible to us, is the upper pole. For that is called right, in each
object, from whence local movement takes its departure, or where local
movement begins. But the revolution of the Heaven begins on the side
where the stars rise; this, therefore, is the true right, and the side
on which they set, is left. If, therefore, it begins from the right, and
 revolves round to the right (&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#941;&#958;&#953;&#945; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;), the invisible
pole must be the upper pole; for, if the visible pole were the upper,
the movement of the Heaven would be to the left, which we deny to be the
 fact. The invisible pole is therefore the upper, and those who live
near it are in the upper hemisphere, and to the right (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;
&#948;&#949;&#958;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;); we on the contrary are in the lower hemisphere, and to the
left. The Pythagoreans are in error when they say that we are in the
upper hemisphere, and to the right, and that inhabitants of the southern
 hemisphere are in the lower hemisphere and to the left. But, speaking
with reference to the second revolution (&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8118;&#962;) or that
 of the planets, which is in the contrary direction to the first
revolution or that of the First Heaven, it is we who are in the upper
hemisphere and on the right side; it is the inhabitants of the southern
hemisphere, who are in the lower hemisphere and on the left side: that
is, it is we who are on the side of the beginning of motion, they who
are on the side of the end (ss. 1-10).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 3. — I have previously laid it down, that
 circular movement is not opposite to circular. But, if this be the
case, what is the reason that there are many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="page641" id="page641"></a>641</span>
 revolutions in the Heaven? This is what I shall now enquire, fully
aware of the great distance from which the enquiry must be conducted
(&#960;&#972;&#8164;&#8165;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;) — not so much a distance in place, as owing to the small
number of accompanying facts which can be observed by the senses
respecting them.</p>
<p>
The cause must be looked for in this direction. Every thing which
performs a work, exists for the sake of that work. Now the work of Deity
 is immortality, or eternal life; so that the divine substance must of
necessity be in eternal motion. The Heaven is a divine body and has for
that reason the encyclical body, whose nature it is to be moved for ever
 in a circle. But why is not the whole body of the Heaven thus
constituted (<i>i.e.</i>, encyclical)? Because it is necessary that some
 portion of its body should remain stationary in the centre; and no
portion of the encyclical body can possibly remain stationary, either in
 the centre or elsewhere. For, if it could, its natural motion (<i>i.e.</i>,
 the motion of that supposed portion) would be towards the centre;
whereas its natural motion is circular; and it cannot move towards the
centre contrary to its nature, because on that supposition its motion
would not be eternal: no motion contrary to nature can be eternal.
Moreover that which is contrary to nature is posterior to that which is
natural; it is a deviation therefrom arising in the course of generation
 (s. 1).</p>
<p>
Hence it is necessary that earth should exist, the nature of which it is to rest in the centre (<i>i.e.</i>,
 the divine encyclical body will not suffice alone, without adjuncts of
different nature). I assume this for the present; more will be said
about it anon.</p>
<p>
But, if earth exists, fire must exist also; for of two contraries, if
the one exist by nature, the other must exist by nature also. For the
matter of contraries is the same, and Form (positive and affirmable) is
prior by nature to Privation (for example, hot is prior to cold); now
rest and gravity denote the privation of motion and lightness (s. 2 — <i>i.e.</i>,
 fire is prior in nature to earth, as having the positive essences
motion and levity, while earth has for its essence the privation
thereof).</p>
<p>
Again, if fire and earth exist, the two other elements intermediate
between them must also exist; for each of the four elements has its
peculiar mode of contrariety with reference to each. At least let this
be assumed now: I shall show it at length presently.</p>
<p>
Now, these points being established, we see that generation must
necessarily come to pass, because no one of the four elements can be
eternal: they act upon each other, and suffer from each other, with
contrary effects; they are destructive of each other. Besides, each of
them has a mode of motion natural and appropriate to it, but this mode
of motion is not eternal (because it is either to the centre or to the
circumference and therefore has a natural terminus). It is not
reasonable to suppose that any Mobile can be eternal, whose natural mode
 of motion cannot be eternal (s. 3).</p>
<p>
Thus the four elements are not eternal, but require to be renewed by
generation; therefore generation must come to pass. But, if generation
be necessary, more than one revolution of the celestial body is
indispensably required: two at least, if not more. For, if there were no
 other revolution except that of the First Heaven, that is consistent
only with a perfectly uniform condition of the four elements in relation
 to each other (s. 4).</p>
<p>
When the question is asked, therefore, Why there are (not one only but) several encyclical bodies? I answer: Because generation <i>must</i>
 come to pass. There must be generation, if there be fire; there must be
 fire and the other elements, if there be earth; there must be earth,
because something must remain stationary eternally in the centre, if
there is to be eternal revolution (s. 5).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 4. — The Heaven is by necessity
spherical: this figure is at once both most akin to its essence and
first in its own nature. I shall begin with some observations respecting
 figures generally — plane and solid, as to which among them is the
first. Every plane figure is either rectilinear or curvilinear; the
former is comprehended by many lines, the latter only by one. Now, since
 in every department one is prior to many and simple to compound, the
first of all plane figures must be the circle. Moreover, since that is
perfect which can receive nothing additional from without, and since
addition can be made to every straight line, but none whatever to the
line circumscribing a circle, it is plain that this latter is perfect;
and therefore the circle is the first of all plane figures, and the
sphere of all solid figures (ss. 1, 2). This doctrine appears most
reasonable when we set out the different figures, each with a number
belonging to it in numerical order. The circle corresponds to One, the
triangle to Two, since its three angles are equal to two right angles;
whereas, if we assign number One to the triangle and place that first,
we can find no number fit for the circle: the circle will be no longer
recognized as a figure (s. 4).</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page642" id="page642"></a>642</span>Now,
since the first figure belongs to the first body, which is that in the
extreme or farthest circumference, this body which revolves constantly
in a circle, will be spherical in figure. That which is continuous with
it even to the centre, will also be spherical; and all the interior
parts are in contact and continuity with it: the parts below the sphere
of the planets touch the sphere above them. So that the whole revolving
current, interior and exterior, will be spherical; for all things touch
and are continuous with the spheres (s. 5).</p>
<p>
There is another reason too why the universe is spherical in figure,
since it has been shown to revolve in a circle. I have proved before
that there exists nothing on the outside of the universe; neither place
nor vacuum. If the figure of the Kosmos, revolving as it does in a
circle, were any thing else but spherical — if it were either
rectilinear or elliptical — it could not possibly cover exactly the same
 space during all its revolutions: there must therefore be place and
vacuum without it; which has been shown to be impossible (s. 6).</p>
<p>
Farthermore, the rotation of the Heaven is the measure of motions,
because it is the only one continuous and uniform and eternal. Now in
every department the measure is the least, and the least motion is the
quickest; accordingly the rotation of the Heaven will be the quickest of
 all motions (s. 7). But among all curved lines from the same back to
the same, the circumference of the circle is the shortest, and motion
will be quickest over the shortest distance. Accordingly, since the
Heaven revolves in a circle and with the quickest of all motions, its
figure must be spherical (s. 8).</p>
<p>
We may also draw the same conclusion from the bodies fixed in the
central parts of the Kosmos. The Earth in the centre is surrounded by
water; the water, by air; the air, by fire. The uppermost bodies
surround the fire, following the like proportion or analogy; being not
continuous therewith, but in contact therewith. Now the surface of water
 is spherical; and that which is either continuous with the spherical or
 surrounds the spherical, must itself be spherical also (s. 9). That the
 surface of the water is truly spherical, we may infer from the fact,
that it is the nature of water always to flow together into the lowest
cavities, that is, into the parts nearest to the centre (s. 10).</p>
<p>
From all the foregoing reasonings, we see plainly that the Kosmos is
spherical, and moreover turned with such a degree of exact sphericity
(&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; &#7956;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;), that no piece of human workmanship nor
any thing ever seen by us on earth can be compared to it. For none of
the component materials here on earth is so fit for receiving perfect
level and accuracy as the nature of the First or Peripheral Body; it
being clear that, in the same proportion as water is more exactly
spherical, the elements surrounding the water become more and more
spherical in proportion as they are more and more distant from the
centre (s. 11).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 5. — Circular revolution may take place
in two directions; from the point A on one side towards B, or on the
other side towards C. That these two are not contrary to each other, I
have already shown. But, since in eternal substances nothing can
possibly take place by chance or spontaneity, and since both the Heaven
and its circular revolution are eternal, we may enquire what is the
reason why this revolution takes place in one direction and not in the
other. This circumstance either depends upon some first principle, or is
 itself a first principle (s. 1). Perhaps some may consider it a mark
either of great silliness, or great presumption, to declare any positive
 opinion at all upon some matters, or upon all matters whatever, leaving
 out nothing. But we must not censure indiscriminately all who do this:
we must consider what is the motive which prompts each person to declare
 himself, and with what amount of confidence he affirms, whether
allowing for human fallibility or setting himself above it. Whenever a
man can find out exact and necessary grounds for the conclusions which
he propounds, we ought to be grateful to him: here we must deliver what
appears to be the truth. Nature (we know) always does what is best among
 all the practicable courses. Now the upper place is more divine than
the lower, and accordingly among rectilinear currents, that which is
directed upwards is the more honourable. In the same manner, the current
 forwards is more honourable than backwards; and the current towards the
 right more honourable than that towards the left — as was before laid
down. The problem above started indicates to us that there is here a
real Prius and Posterius — a better and a worse; for, when we recognize
this, the difficulty is solved. The solution is that this is the best
practicable arrangement, viz., that the Kosmos is moved in a motion,
simple, never-ending, and in the most honourable direction (&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;
&#964;&#953;&#956;&#953;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, s. 2).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 6. — I have now to show that this motion
of the First Heaven is uniform and not irregular (&#8001;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#8052;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#954;
&#7936;&#957;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;): I speak only of the First Heaven <span class="pagenum"><a name="page643" id="page643"></a>643</span>and
 of the First Rotation; for in the substances lower than this many
rotations or currents have coalesced into one. If the motion of the
First Heaven be irregular, there will clearly be acceleration and
remission of its motion, and an extreme point or maximum (&#7936;&#954;&#956;&#942;) thereof.
 Now the maximum of motion must take place either at the terminus <i>ad quem</i>, as in things moved according to nature; or at the terminus <i>a quo</i>,
 as in things moved contrary to nature; or during the interval between,
as in things thrown (&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#8165;&#953;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;). But in circular motion,
there is neither terminus <i>a quo</i>, nor terminus <i>ad quem</i>, nor
 middle between the two — neither beginning, nor end, nor mean; for it
is eternal in duration, compact as to length or space moved over, and
unbroken (&#964;&#8183; &#956;&#942;&#954;&#949;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#951;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#954;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;). It thus cannot have any
maximum or acceleration or remission; and of course, therefore, it
cannot be irregular (s. 1).</p>
<p>
Besides, since every thing that is moved is moved by some thing, the
irregularity, if there be such, must arise either from the Movens, or
the Motum, or both: the power of the Movens, or the quality of the
Motum, or both, must undergo change. But nothing of the sort can happen
with the Motum, being in this case the Heaven; for it has been shown to
be a First, simple, ungenerable, indestructible, and in every way
unchangeable. Much more then is it reasonable to believe that the Movens
 is such; for that which is qualified to move the First, must be itself a
 First (&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;); that which is qualified to
move the simple, must be itself simple, &amp;c. If then the Motum, which
 is a body, undergoes no change, neither will the Movens, being as it is
 incorporeal (s. 2). Accordingly the current, or motion (&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;), cannot
possibly be irregular. For, if it comes to pass irregularly, its
irregularity either pervades the whole, the velocity becoming
alternately more or less, or certain parts only. But, in regard to the
parts separately, there is certainly no irregularity: if there had been,
 the relative distances of the stars one from the other would have
varied in the course of infinite time; now no such variation in their
distances has ever been observed. Neither in regard to the whole is
there any irregularity. For irregularity implies relaxation, and
relaxation arises in every subject from impotence. Now impotence is
contrary to nature: in animals, all impotences (such as old age or
decay) are contrary to nature; for all animals, perhaps, are compounds
put together out of elements each of which has a different place of its
own and not one of which is in its own place. In the First Bodies, on
the other hand, which are simple, unmixed, in their own places, and
without any contrary, there can be no impotence, and therefore neither
relaxation nor intensification, which always go together (&#949;&#7984; &#947;&#8048;&#961;
&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, s. 3). Besides, we cannot with any reason suppose
that the Movens is impotent for an infinite time, and then again potent
for an infinite time; nothing contrary to nature lasts for an infinite
time, and impotence is contrary to nature; nor can it be for an equal
time contrary to nature and agreeable to nature — impotent and potent.
If the motion relaxes, it cannot go on relaxing for an infinite time,
nor go on being intensified, nor the one and the other alternately. For
in that case the motion would be infinite and indeterminate; which is
impossible, since every motion must be from one term to another term and
 also determinate (s. 4: &#7940;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#951; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7969; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;.
&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#948;&#941; &#966;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#7956;&#954; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7988;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8033;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; — <i>i.e.</i>, all motion must be determined both in distance and direction).</p>
<p>
Again, the supposition may be made that there is a minimum of time
required for the revolution of the Heaven, in less than which the
revolution could not be completed; just as there is a minimum of time
indispensable for a man to walk or play the harp. Admitting this
supposition, there cannot be perpetual increase in the intensity or
velocity of the motion (the increase has an impassable limit), and
therefore there cannot be perpetual relaxation; for both are on the same
 footing (s. 5).</p>
<p>
It might be urged, indeed, that intensification and relaxation go on
alternately; each proceeding to a certain length, and then giving place
to the other. But this is altogether irrational — nothing better than a
gratuitous fiction. Besides, if there were this alternation, we may
reasonably assume that it could not remain concealed from us; for
contrasting conditions coming in immediate sequence to each other are
more easily discerned by sense. What has been said, then, is sufficient
to prove — That the Heaven or Cosmos is one and only one; that it is
ungenerable and eternal; that its motion is uniform (s. 6).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 7. — Next in order, I have to speak of
what are called the Stars (&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#957;). Of what are they
composed? What is their figure? What are their motions?</p>
<p>
It is consistent with the foregoing reasonings, as well as in itself the
 most rational doctrine, to conceive each of the stars as composed of
portions of that body in which its current of motion takes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page644" id="page644"></a>644</span>place;
 that is, of that body, whose nature it is to move in a circle. For
those who affirm the stars to be fire say this because they believe the
upper body to be fire, assuming it as reasonable that each thing should
be composed of the elements in which it is; and I assume the same also
(s. 1). The heat and light of the stars arises from their friction with
the air in their current of motion. If it is the nature of motion to
inflame pieces of wood, and stones, and iron, it is still more
reasonable that what is nearest to fire (that is, air) should be so
inflamed. We see that darts projected are so inflamed, that their leaden
 appendages are melted; and, these being thus inflamed, the air around
them must be modified in the same manner. Now objects like these darts
are thus violently heated, because they are carried along in the medium
of the air, which through the shock given by their motion becomes fire.
But each of the upper bodies or stars is carried round (not in the air,
but) in its appropriate sphere, so that they themselves are not
inflamed; while the air which is under the sphere of the encyclical body
 becomes of necessity heated by the rotation of that sphere; and most of
 all at the point where the Sun has happened to be fastened in (&#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#964;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#8131; &#956;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;, &#8087; &#8001; &#7973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#949;&#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;).</p>
<p>
Let it then be understood, that the stars are neither composed of fire,
nor are they carried round in the medium of the fire (s. 2). </p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 8. — It is seen as a fact, that both the
stars, and the entire Heaven, change their place (&#956;&#949;&#952;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;). Now, in
this change, we must assume either that both continue at rest, or that
both are in motion, or that one is at rest, and the other is in motion.
Now it is impossible that both can be at rest, at least if we assume the
 earth to be at rest; for the facts which we see would not have taken
place, upon that supposition (s. 1). Either therefore both are in
motion, or one is in motion and the other at rest. Now, if both are in
motion, it is against reason that the stars and the circles in which
they are fastened should have equal velocities of motion. Each one of
them must, be equal in velocity to the circle or sphere in which it is
carried, since all come back round along with their circles to the same
position; so that in one and the same time, the star has gone round its
circle, and the circle has completed its revolution. It is not
reasonable to suppose that the velocities of the stars and the
magnitudes of the circles should be in the same proportion. Comparing
one circle with another, indeed, it is not only not absurd, but even
necessary, that the velocities should be in proportion to the
magnitudes; but it is not reasonable that each of the stars in these
circles should be of such velocity. For, if it be necessary that what is
 carried round in the larger circle should have the greater velocity,
the consequence would be that, if the stars in one circle were
transferred to another, their motions would become accelerated or
retarded; which is equivalent to saying that they have no motion of
their own at all, but are carried round by the revolution of the circles
 (s. 2). If, on the contrary, it be not necessary, but a spontaneous
coincidence (&#949;&#7988;&#964;&#949; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;) that what is carried round
in the greater circle has the greater velocity, neither upon this
supposition is it reasonable that in all the circles without exception
the circumference should be greater, and the motion of the star fastened
 in the greater circle quicker, in the same proportion. That this should
 happen with one or two of them, might be reasonably expected; but that
it should happen with all alike, savours of fiction. Moreover chance has
 no place in matters according to nature; nor is that which occurs
everywhere and belongs to all, ever the produce of chance (s. 3).</p>
<p>
So much for the hypothesis, that both stars and circles are in motion.
Let us now assume that one is at rest, and the other in motion; and
first, let the circles be at rest, and the stars in motion. This again
will lead to absurdities; for we shall still be unable to explain how it
 happens that the outermost stars are moved most quickly, and that their
 velocities are proportioned to the magnitudes of the circles.</p>
<p>
Since then we cannot assume either that both are moved, or that the star
 alone is moved, we must adopt the third supposition, that the circles
are moved, and that the stars, being themselves at rest, are fastened in
 the circles and carried round along with them. This is the only
hypothesis which entails no unreasonable consequences. For it is
reasonable that, of circles fastened round the same centre, the greater
velocity should belong to the greatest. For, as in all the varieties of
body the heavier fragment is carried with greater velocity than the
lighter in its appropriate motion, so it happens with the encyclical
body. When two straight lines are drawn from the centre, the segment of
the greater circle intercepted between them will be greater than the
segment of the smaller; and it is consistent with reason that the
greater circle should be carried round in equal time. This is one reason
 why the Kosmos is not split into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page645" id="page645"></a>645</span>separate parts; another reason is, because the universe has been shown to be continuous (s. 4, 5).</p>
<p>
Now we all agree that the stars are of spherical figure: and spherical
bodies have two motions of their own — rolling and rotatory (&#954;&#973;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
 &#948;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;). If they were moved of themselves, they would be moved in one
or other of these two ways; but we see that they are so in neither. They
 do not rotate; for, if they did, they would remain always in the same
place, which contradicts universal observation and belief. Besides, it
is reasonable to suppose that all the stars move in the same manner, but
 the Sun is the only one that is seen so to move, when he rises or sets;
 and he too, not by any movement of his own, but through the distance of
 our vision, which when stretched to a great distance, rotates from
weakness (s. 6). This is perhaps the reason why the stars fastened (in
the outer sphere) twinkle, while the planets do not twinkle; for the
planets are near to us, so that our vision reaches them while yet
strong; whereas in regard to the unmoved stars it is made to quiver in
consequence of the great distance from being stretched out too far, and
its quivering causes the appearance of motion in the star. For there is
no difference between moving the vision and moving the object seen
(&#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8004;&#968;&#953;&#957; &#7970; &#964;&#8056; &#8001;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; — s. 6).</p>
<p>
Again, neither do the stars roll nor revolve forward. For that which
rolls forward must necessarily turn round; but the same side of the moon
 — what is called the face of the moon — is always clearly visible to us
 (s. 7).</p>
<p>
Since it is reasonable to believe, therefore, that, if the stars were
moved in themselves, they would be moved in their own special variety of
 motion (<i>i.e.</i>, rolling or rotatory), and since it has been shown
that they are not moved in either of these two ways, we see plainly that
 they cannot be moved in themselves (but are carried round in the
revolution of the Aplanês).</p>
<p>
Besides, if they were moved in <span class="correction" title="amended from 'them-themselves'">themselves</span>,
 it is unreasonable that Nature should have assigned to them no organ
suitable for motion, since Nature does nothing by haphazard; and that
she should have been considerate in providing for animals, while she
overlooked objects so honourable as the stars. The truth rather is, that
 she has withheld from them, as it were by express purpose, all aids,
through which it was possible for them to advance forward in themselves,
 and has placed them at the greatest possible distance from objects
furnished with organs for motion (s. 8).</p>
<p>
Hence it would seem to be the reasonable doctrine — That the entire
Heaven is spherical, and that each of the stars (fastened in it) is also
 spherical. For the sphere is the most convenient of all figures for
motion in the same place, so that the Heaven being spherical would be
moved most rapidly and would best maintain its own place. But for
forward motion the sphere is of all figures the most inconvenient; for
it least resembles self-moving bodies; it has no outlying appendage or
projecting end, as rectilinear figures have, and stands farthest removed
 from the figures of marching bodies.</p>
<p>
Since therefore it is the function of (&#948;&#949;&#8150;) the Heaven to be moved by a
motion in the same place (&#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8183; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;), and that of
the stars not to make any advance by themselves (&#964;&#8048; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#948;’ &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945; &#956;&#8052;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#776;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#953;’ &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8182;&#957;), it is with good reason that both of them are
spherical. For thus will the Heaven best be moved, and the stars will
best be at rest.</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 9. — From what I have said, it is plain
that those who affirm that the revolving celestial bodies emit in their
revolutions sounds harmonious to each other, speak cleverly and
ingeniously, but not consistently with the truth. There must necessarily
 be sound (they say) from the revolution of such vast bodies. Since
bodies near to us make sound in motion, the sun, moon, and stars, being
so much larger and moving with so much greater velocity, must make an
immense sound; and, since their distances and velocities are assumed to
be in harmonic proportion, the sounds emitted in their revolution must
also be in harmony. To the question put to them — Why do we not hear
this immense sound? they reply, that we have been hearing it constantly
from the moment of our birth; that we have no experience of an opposite
state, or state of silence, with which to contrast it, and that sound
and silence are discriminated only by relation to each other (&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#956;&#8052;
&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#963;&#953;&#947;&#942;&#957;· &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#945; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#953;&#947;&#8134;&#962;
&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#940;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957;); that men thus cease to be affected by it, just as
blacksmiths from constant habit cease to be affected by the noise of
their own work (s. 1).</p>
<p>
The reasoning of these philosophers (the Pythagoreans), as I have just
said, is graceful and poetical, yet nevertheless inadmissible. For they
ought to explain, upon their hypothesis, not merely why we hear nothing,
 but why we experience no uncomfortable impressions apart from hearing.
For prodigious sounds pierce through and destroy the continuity even of
inanimate bodies; thus thunder splits <span class="pagenum"><a name="page646" id="page646"></a>646</span>up
 stones and other bodies of the greatest strength. The impression
produced here by the sound of the celestial bodies must be violent
beyond all endurance. But there is good reason why we neither hear nor
suffer any thing from them; viz., that they make no sound. The cause
thereof is one which attests the truth of my doctrine laid down above —
That the stars are not moved of themselves, but carried round by and in
the circle to which they are fastened. Bodies thus carried round, make
no sound or shock: it is only bodies carried round of themselves that
make sound and shock. Bodies which are fastened in, or form parts of, a
revolving body, cannot possibly sound, any more than the parts of a ship
 moving, nor indeed could the whole ship sound, if carried along in a
running river. Yet the Pythagoreans might urge just the same reasons to
prove that bodies so large as the mast, the stern, and the entire ship,
could not be moved without noise. Whatever is carried round, indeed, in a
 medium not itself carried round, really makes sound; but it cannot do
so, if the medium itself be carried round continuously. We must
therefore in this case maintain that, if the vast bodies of the stars
were carried round in a medium either of air or of fire (whose motion is
 rectilinear), as all men say that they are, they must necessarily make a
 prodigious sound, which would reach here to us and would wear us out
(&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#949;&#953;&#957;). Since nothing of this nature occurs, we may be sure that
the stars are not carried round in a current of their own, either
animated or violent. It is as if Nature had foreseen the consequence,
that, unless the celestial motions were carried on in the manner in
which they are carried on, nothing of what now takes place near us (&#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#8166;&#961;&#959; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957;), could have been as it is now. I have thus shown
that the stars are spherical, and that they are not moved by a motion of
 their own (ss. 2-5).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 10. — Respecting the arrangement of the
stars — how each of them is placed, some anterior others posterior, and
what are their distances from each other — the books on astronomy must
be consulted and will explain. It consists with the principles there
laid down, that the motions of the stars (planets) should be
proportional to their distances, some quicker, others slower. For, since
 the farthest circle of the Heaven has a revolution both simple and of
extreme velocity, while the revolutions of the other stars (planets) are
 many in number and slower, each of them being carried round in its own
circle in the direction contrary to that of the first or farthest circle
 of the Heaven, the reasonable consequence is, that that planet which is
 nearest to the first and simple revolving circle takes the longest time
 to complete its own (counter-revolving) circle, while that which is
most distant from the same circle takes the shortest time, and the
remaining planets take more or less time in proportion as they are
nearer or farther. For the planet nearest to the first revolving circle
has its own counterrevolution most completely conquered or overpowered
thereby; the planet farthest from the same, has its own
counterrevolution least conquered thereby; and the intermediate planets
more or less in inverse proportion to their distances from the same, as
mathematicians demonstrate.</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 11. — We may most reasonably assume the
figure of the stars to be spherical. For, since we have shown that it is
 not their nature to have any motion of their own, and since Nature does
 nothing either irrational or in vain, it is plain that she has assigned
 to the immovables that figure which is least fit for motion; which
figure is the sphere, as having no organ for motion. Besides, what is
true of one is true of all (&#7956;&#964;&#953; &#948;’ &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7957;&#957;): now the
Moon may be shown to be spherical, first, by the visible manifestations
which she affords in her waxings and wanings, next, from astronomical
observations of the eclipses of the Sun. Since therefore one among the
stars is shown to be spherical, we may presume that the rest will be so
likewise. </p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 12. — I proceed to two other
difficulties, which are well calculated to perplex every one. We must
try to state what looks most like truth, considering such forwardness
not to be of the nature of audacity, but rather to deserve respect, when
 any one, stimulated by the thirst for philosophy, contents himself with
 small helps and faint approximations to truth, having to deal with the
gravest difficulties.</p>
<p>
1. Why is it, that the circles farthest from the outermost circle (or
Aplanês) are not always moved by a greater number of motions than those
nearer to it? Why are some of the intermediate circles (neither farthest
 nor nearest) moved by a greater number of motions than any of the
others? For it would seem reasonable, when the First Body is moved by
one single rotatory current, that the one nearest to it should be moved
by two, the next nearest by three, and so on in regular sequence to
those which are more distant. But we find that the reverse occurs in
fact: Sun and Moon have fewer movements than some of the planets, which
are nevertheless farther <span class="pagenum"><a name="page647" id="page647"></a>647</span>from
 the centre, and nearer to the First Body. In regard to some of the
planets, we know this by visual evidence; for we have seen the Moon when
 at half-moon passing under Mars, who was occulted by the dark part of
her body, and emerged on the bright side of it. The like is attested
respecting the other planets, by the Egyptians and Babylonians, the most
 ancient of all observers.</p>
<p>
2. Why is it, that in the First Revolution (in the revolution of the
First Heaven or First Body) there is included so vast a multitude of
stars as to seem innumerable; while in each of the others there is one
alone and apart, never two or more fastened in the same current?</p>
<p>
Here are two grave difficulties, which it is well to investigate and try
 to understand, though our means of information are very scanty, and
though we stand at so great a distance from the facts. Still, as far as
we can make out from such data, these difficulties would not seem to
involve any philosophical impossibility or incongruity. Now we are in
the habit of considering these celestial bodies as bodies only; and as
monads which have indeed regular arrangement, but are totally destitute
of soul or vital principle. (When Aristotle here says <i>we</i>, he must
 mean the philosophers whose point of view he is discussing: for the
general public certainly did not regard the Sun, Moon, and stars as
&#7940;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#945; &#960;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#957;, but, on the contrary, considered this as blameable heresy,
 and looked upon them as Gods<span class="correction" title="amended from ').'">.)</span>
 We ought, however, to conceive them as partaking of life and action
(&#948;&#949;&#8150; &#948;’ &#8033;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#950;&#969;&#8134;&#962;); and in this point
of view the actual state of the case will appear nowise unreasonable (s.
 2). For we should naturally expect that to that which is in the best
possible condition, such well-being will belong without any agency at
all; to that which is next best, through agency single and slight; to
such as are farther removed in excellence of condition, through action
more multiplied and diversified. Just so in regard to the human body:
the best constituted body maintains its good condition without any
training at all; there are others which will do the same at the cost of
nothing more than a little walking; there are inferior bodies which
require, for the same result, wrestling, running, and other motions;
while there are even others which cannot by any amount of labour attain a
 good condition, but are obliged to be satisfied with something short of
 it (s. 3). Moreover it is difficult to succeed in many things, or to
succeed often: you may throw one or two sixes with the dice, but you
cannot throw ten thousand; and, farther, when the conditions of the
problem become complicated — when one thing is to be done for the sake
of another, that other for a third result, and that third for a fourth,
&amp;c. — success, which may be tolerably easy when the steps are only
few, the more they are multiplied, becomes harder and harder.</p>
<p>
Hence we must consider the agency of the stars as analogous to that of
plants and animals. For here the agency of man is most multifarious,
since he is capable of attaining many varieties of good, and accordingly
 busies himself about many things and about one thing for the sake of
others. The agency of other animals on the other hand is more
restricted; that of plants yet more so, being of slight force and only
of one special character (s. 4). But that which exists in the best
possible condition stands in no need of acting or agency; for it already
 possesses that for the sake of which action is undertaken. Now action
always includes two elements — that for the sake of which and what is
for the sake thereof — the end and the means: there is either some one
end, which the agent may attain, as in the case of man; or there are
many different matters all of which may be used as means towards the
best possible condition. Thus one agent possesses and partakes of the
best possible condition; another comes near to it with little trouble; a
 third, with much trouble; a fourth does not even aspire to the end, but
 is competent only to arrive near to the last of the means. For example,
 let health be the end: one man is always in health; a second becomes
so, by being starved down; a third by that, combined with running
exercise; a fourth is obliged to take some additional exercise, in order
 to qualify himself for running, so that his motions are multiplied; a
fifth is incapable of arriving at health, but arrives only at the
running and the being thinned down, one of which in this case serves as
end. For it would be best for all, if they could attain the supreme end —
 health; but, if that be impossible, then the next best thing is to get
as near to the best as possible (ss. 5-7).</p>
<p>
For this reason the Earth is not moved at all, and the matters near the
Earth are moved with few motions; since they do not arrive at the
extreme best, but only as near as their ability permits to obtain or hit
 the supremely divine principle; while the First Heaven, on the
contrary, obtains or hits it at once, through one single motion; and the
 bodies intermediate between the First Heaven and those which are last
(or nearest to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page648" id="page648"></a>648</span>Earth), obtain it or arrive at it also, but only through a greater number of motions.</p>
<p>
There is the other difficulty also to be considered — that vast
multitude of stars are put all together in the one single First Current
or Revolution, but each of the other stars (planets) has its own motions
 singly and apart. The principal reason of this we may fairly suppose to
 be that it follows as a natural consequence from the vast superiority
of the first, in each variety of life and in each beginning, over all
posterior to the first. Here the First Current or Revolution, being one
and by itself, moves many of the divine bodies, while the others
(secondary or countercurrents), numerous as they are, move each only
one; for each one of these wandering bodies or planets is carried by
many different currents. Thus Nature establishes equalization and a sort
 of symmetry, by assigning, in the one case, many bodies to one current,
 and in the other, many currents to one body (ss. 8-10). Beside this
principal reason, there is also another. The other currents have each
one body only, because motion is given to many bodies by all of them
prior to the last which bears the one star. For the last sphere is
carried round fastened into many spheres, and each sphere is a body (ss.

C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 13. — Having thus explained, respecting
the Stars and Planets which are carried round in circular motion, what
is their essence, figure, current, and order of position, we now proceed
 to speak of the Earth: What is its position? Whether is it at rest or
in motion? What is its figure?</p>
<p>
Philosophers differ respecting the position of the Earth. Most of those
who conceive the entire Kosmos as finite, declare the Earth to be in its
 centre. But the Italian philosophers, called Pythagoreans, are of an
opposite opinion; affirming that Fire is in the centre, and that the
Earth, being one of the stars revolving round the centre, makes night
and day. They assume moreover another Earth opposite to this (&#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957;
&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#8131;) — which other they call <i>Antichthon</i>. Herein they do
not adjust their theories and look out for causes adapted to the
phenomena; but, on the contrary, they distort the phenomena so as to
suit their own doctrines and reasonings, and try to constitute
themselves auxiliary governors of the Kosmos (&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#957; — s.
 1). And, if we are to look for assurance not to the phenomena but to
our own reasonings, many others might agree with them, that it is not
proper (&#956;&#8052; &#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957;) to assign to the Earth the central place. They think
that the most honourable place belongs to the most honourable body, and
that Fire is more honourable than Earth; that the two extremes, centre
and circumference, are more honourable than the parts intermediate
between them. Upon these grounds they consider that Fire and not Earth
is at the centre of the Universal Sphere; and they have another reason,
peculiar to themselves, for this conclusion: they hold that the centre
is the most important place in the universe, and that it ought as such
to be the most carefully guarded; wherefore they call it the watch of
Zeus (&#916;&#953;&#8056;&#962; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#942;&#957;), and regard it as occupied by Fire (s. 2).</p>
<p>
This assumes that what is absolutely (<i>i.e.</i>, without subjoining any qualifying adjunct), described as <i>the centre</i>,
 is at once centre of the magnitude, centre of the object, and centre of
 nature. But we ought rather to follow the analogy of animals, where the
 same point is not the centre of the animal and the centre of the body:
the case is the same in the entire Kosmos. Hence the Pythagoreans need
not feel any anxiety about the Universe (&#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#952;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8118;&#957;), nor introduce a guard at the centre. They ought rather to
enquire where and of what character the middle point is; for that middle
 point is the true beginning and the honourable. The middle of the place
 occupied is rather like an end than like a beginning; for that which is
 limited is the middle, that which limits is the boundary: now that
which comprehends and is boundary, is more honourable than that which is
 bounded; the former is the Essence of the entire compound, the latter
is only its Matter (s. 3).</p>
<p>
As about the place of the Earth, so also about its motion or rest,
philosophers differ. The Pythagoreans and those who do not even place it
 at the centre, consider it to revolve in a circle, and they consider
the Antichthon to revolve in like manner. Some even think it possible
that there may be many other bodies carried round the centre in like
manner, though invisible to us, by reason of the obstructing body of the
 Earth. Hence (they say) the eclipses of the moon are more frequent than
 those <span class="pagenum"><a name="page649" id="page649"></a>649</span>of
 the Sun; since not only the Earth, but also each of these unseen
bodies, causes the Moon to be eclipsed. For, the Earth not being a
point, we on the circumference thereof, even assuming it to occupy the
centre, are distant from the centre by the entire hemisphere of the
Earth; yet we do not find out that we are not in the centre, and
astronomical appearances present themselves to us just as if we were so.
 Thus it happens (according to these philosophers), the Earth not being
in the centre at all: the appearances presented to us are just the same
as if we were at the centre.</p>
<p>
Again, there are some who (like Plato in Timæus) affirm that the Earth,
though situated in the centre, is packed and revolves round the axis
stretched across the universe (s. 4).</p>
<p>
About the figure of the Earth, there is no less difference of opinion.
Some say that it is spherical; others, that it is flat and in shape like
 a tambourine (&#964;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#942;&#962;). These last adduce as proof, that the Sun,
at rising and setting, exhibits a rectilinear section or eclipse of his
disk and not a circular one, when partially concealed by the Earth, and
becoming invisible under the horizon or visible above the horizon. They
do not take proper account of the vast distance of the Sun and the
magnitude of his circumference. The segment of a long circle appears
from a distance like a straight line. These philosophers further add,
that the flat tambourine-like shape must be inferred of necessity from
the fact that the Earth remains stationary (s. 5).</p>
<p>
Upon this disputed question, a feeling of perplexity comes unavoidably
upon every one. It would argue a very irrational mind not to wonder how a
 small piece of the Earth, if suspended in the air, is carried downward
and will not stop of itself, and the larger piece is carried downward
more quickly than the smaller; while nevertheless the entire Earth, if
suspended in like manner, would not be so carried. In spite of its great
 weight, it remains stationary (s. 6). But the solutions of this problem
 which some suggest are more strange and full of perplexity, and it is
surprising that they have not been so considered. The Kolophonian
Xenophanes affirmed that the lower depths of the Earth were rooted
downwards to infinity, in order to escape the troublesome obligation of
looking for a reason why it remained stationary. Others say, that the
Earth rests upon water, floating thereupon like wood: this is an ancient
 doctrine promulgated by Thales; as if there were not as much perplexity
 about the water which supports the Earth, as there is about the Earth
itself. For it is not the nature of water to remain suspended, but
always to rest upon something (s. 7). Moreover, air is lighter than
water, and water lighter than earth; how then can these men think that
the substance naturally lighter can lie below the substance naturally
heavier? Besides, if it were the nature of the whole Earth to remain
resting on water, it must be the nature of each part of the Earth to do
the same; but this does not happen: each part of the earth is carried
down to the bottom, and the greater part more quickly than the less (s.
8).</p>
<p>
All these philosophers carry their researches to a certain point, but
not to the bottom of the problem. It is indeed a habit with all of us to
 conduct our enquiries not with reference to the problem itself, but
with reference to our special opponents. If we have no opponent but are
conducting our investigations alone, we pursue them as far as that point
 where we can make no farther objections to ourselves. Whoever therefore
 intends to investigate completely must take care to make objections to
himself upon all the points of objection which really belong to the
subject; and this he can only do after having thoroughly surveyed all
the differences of opinion and doctrine (s. 9).</p>
<p>
The reason why the Earth remains at rest, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, and
Demokritus, declare to be its breadth or flatness (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#962;): it does
not (they say) divide the air beneath, but covers over the air like a
lid (&#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;’ &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#960;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7936;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;); as we see
 that flat and spreading bodies usually do, being difficult to be moved
and making strong resistance even against the winds. The Earth does the
same, through its flatness, against the air beneath, which remains at
rest there (in the opinion of these philosophers) because it finds no
sufficient place into which to travel, like water in a <i>klepsydra</i>:
 they also produce many evidences to show that air thus imprisoned,
while remaining stationary, can support a heavy weight (s. 10).</p>
<p>
Now, in the first place, these men affirm that, unless the shape of the
Earth were flat, it would not remain at rest. Yet on their own showing
it is not alone the flat shape of the earth which causes it to remain at
 rest, but rather its magnitude. For the air beneath remains <i>in situ</i>
 by reason of its vast mass, finding no means of escape through the
narrow passage: and the mass of the air is thus vast, because it is
imprisoned inside by the great magnitude of the Earth; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page650" id="page650"></a>650</span>which
 effect will be produced in the same manner, even though the Earth be
spherical, provided it be of its present magnitude. Moreover,
philosophers who hold this opinion about the motion of the Earth, think
only of its motion as a whole, and take no account of its parts. For
they ought to define at the first step whether bodies have or have not
one special mode of motion by nature; and, if none by nature, then
whether they have any mode of motion violent or contra-natural. I have
already determined this point as well as my powers admitted, and shall
therefore assume the results as settled. If there be no special motion
natural to bodies, neither will there be any which is contra-natural or
violent; and, if there be none either natural or violent, no body will
be moved at all. I have already shown that this is a necessary
consequence; and, farther, that (upon that supposition) there can be no
body even at rest; for rest, like motion, is either natural or
contra-natural; and, if there be any special mode of motion which is
natural, neither contra-natural motion, nor contra-natural rest, can
stand alone (ss. 11-13).</p>
<p>
Let us then assume (reasoning on the hypothesis of these philosophers)
that the Earth now remains in its present place contrary to nature, and
that it was carried into aggregation at the centre by the revolution of
the Kosmos (also contrary to nature — &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;
 &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; — s. 14). For all those who recognize a generation of
the Kosmos assign this revolution as the cause which determined the
aggregation of the Earth at the centre, upon the analogy of particles
carried round in liquids or in air, where the larger and heavier
particles are always carried to the centre of the revolution. They
profess thus to know the cause which determined the Earth to <i>come to</i>
 the centre; but what they seek to find out is the cause which
determines it to remain there, and upon that they differ: some saying,
as has been stated just now, that its breadth and magnitude is the
cause; others, with Empedokles, ascribing the fact to the revolution of
the Heaven, the extreme velocity of which checks the fall of the Earth
downward, just as water in a cup may be whirled rapidly round without
falling to the ground. But suppose absence of these two causes: in which
 direction will the Earth be naturally carried? Not to the centre; for
(upon the doctrine which we are now criticising) its motion to the
centre, and its remaining at the centre, are both of them
contra-natural; but some special mode of motion, natural to the Earth,
there must necessarily be. Is this upward, or downward, or in what other
 direction? If there be no greater tendency downward than upward, and if
 the air above does not hinder the Earth from tending upward, neither
will the air beneath hinder it from tending downwards: the same causes
produce the same effects, operating on the same matter (ss. 14, 15).</p>
<p>
A farther argument becomes applicable, when we are reasoning against
Empedokles. When the four elements were first separated out of their
confused huddle by the influence of Contention, what was the cause for
the Earth to remain still and <i>in situ</i>? Empedokles cannot claim to
 introduce then the agency of the cosmical revolution. Moreover, it is
strange that he should not have reflected that in the first instance the
 particles and fragments of the Earth were carried to the centre. But
what is the cause now that every thing having weight is carried towards
the Earth? It cannot be the revolution of the Heaven which brings these
things nearer to us (s. 16).</p>
<p>
Again, Fire is carried upward. What is the cause of this? The revolution
 of the Heaven cannot cause it. But, if it be the nature of fire to be
carried in one certain direction, it must be equally the nature of Earth
 to be carried in one certain direction. Light and heavy, also, are not
discriminated by the heavenly revolution. There are matters originally
heavy, and matters originally light: the former are carried to the
centre, the latter to the circumference, each by its own special motion.
 Even prior to the heavenly revolution there existed things
intrinsically light and intrinsically heavy; which are discriminated by
certain attributes — a certain natural mode of motion and a certain
place. In infinite space, there can be no upward and downward; and it is
 by this (local distinction) that light and heavy are discriminated (ss.
 17, 18).</p>
<p>
While most philosophers insist upon the causes just noticed why the
Earth remains stationary where it is, there are others, like
Anaximander, among the ancients, who say that it remains so because of
its likeness or equality (&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; — equal tendency in all
directions). That which is situated in the centre (they say) and which
has like relation to the extreme parts (<i>i.e.</i>, like to <i>all</i>
the extreme parts) ought not to be carried any more upward or downward
or sideways; and it cannot be moved in opposite directions at once; so
that it remains stationary by necessity (s. 19).</p>
<p>
This doctrine is ingenious, but not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page651" id="page651"></a>651</span>true.
 For the property affirmed is noway peculiar to the Earth: the
affirmation is, that every thing which is placed at the centre must of
necessity remain there; so that Fire also would remain there at rest, as
 well as Earth. But this necessity must be denied. For it is shown by
observation that the Earth not only remains at the centre, but is
carried to the centre; since each part of it is carried thither, and,
whithersoever the parts are carried, the whole is carried necessarily to
 the same point. The peculiar property of the earth therefore is, not
(as this hypothesis declares) to have like relation to all the extreme
parts — for that is common to all the elements — but to be carried
towards the centre (ss. 20, 21).</p>
<p>
Moreover, it is absurd to investigate why the Earth remains at the
centre, and not to investigate equally why Fire remains at the
extremity. For, if you explain this last by saying that Fire has its
natural place at the extremity, the Earth must have its natural place
somewhere else. If the centre be not the natural place of the Earth, and
 if the Earth remains there through like tendency in all directions,
like the hair in equal tension or the man both hungry and thirsty
between food and drink, you must equally assign the reason why Fire
remains at the extremity. It is singular too that you should try to
explain only the <i>remaining at rest</i> (&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8134;&#962;) of the Earth, and not
also seek to explain the natural current (&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;) — why Earth is carried
downward, and Fire upward, when there is no opposing force (s. 22).</p>
<p>
Nor can it be admitted that the doctrine is true. Thus much indeed is
true by accident — that every thing which has no greater obligation to
be moved in this direction than in that, must necessarily remain at the
centre. But this is true only so long as it remains a compact whole;
for, according to the theory which we are discussing, it will not remain
 stationary, but will be moved: not indeed as a whole, but dispersed
into parts (s. 23: &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#956;&#8052;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;. &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;

 — I understand &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; to mean, subject to the condition of its
 remaining a compact whole). For the same reasoning would apply to Fire
as well as to Earth: it would prove that Fire, if placed at the centre,
will remain there just as much as Earth, because Fire will have like
relation to each point of the extreme periphery. Yet nevertheless it
will (not remain at the centre, but will) be carried away, if not
impeded, as we observe that it is carried in fact, to the periphery;
only not all to one and the same point of the periphery, but
corresponding portions of the Fire to corresponding portions of the
periphery: I mean, that the fourth part (<i>e.g.</i>) of the Fire will
be carried to the fourth part of the periphery; for a point is no real
part of bodies (&#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#8052; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;). This is the only
necessary consequence flowing from the principle of likeness of
relation. As, if supposed to be put all together at the centre, it would
 contract from a larger area into a smaller, so, when carried away from
the centre to the different parts of the periphery, it would become
rarer and would expand from a smaller area into a larger. In like manner
 the Earth also would be moved away from the centre, if you reason upon
this principle of likeness of relation, and if the centre were not the
place belonging to it by nature (s. 24).</p>
<p>
C<span class="smcap">H</span>. 14. — Having thus reported the
suppositions of others respecting the figure, place, rest and motion, of
 the Earth, I shall now deliver my own opinion, first, whether it is in
motion or at rest; for some philosophers, as I have said, regard it as
one of the stars (and therefore not in the centre, but moving round the
centre — the Pythagorean theory); others (as Plato), though they place
it in the centre, consider it to be packed and moved round the middle of
 the axis of the Kosmos (&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#965; &#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, &#949;&#7984;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#943; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#957;).</p>
<p>
That neither of these hypotheses is possible, we shall perceive if we
take as our point of departure — That, if the Earth be carried round,
whether in the centre or apart from the centre, such motion must
necessarily be violent or contra-natural. Such motion does not belong
naturally to the Earth itself; for, if such were the fact, it would
belong equally to each portion of the Earth, whereas we see that all
these portions are carried in a straight line to the centre. Being thus
violent or contra-natural, it cannot possibly be eternal. But the order
of the Kosmos is eternal. Besides, all the bodies which are carried
round in a circular revolution (all except the First or Outermost Sphere
 — the Aplanês) appear to observation as lagging behind and as being
moved in more than one current. The like ought to happen with the Earth,
 if moved round, whether on the centre or apart from the centre: it
ought to be moved in two currents; and, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page652" id="page652"></a>652</span>as
 a consequence thereof, there ought to be side-motions and back-turnings
 of the stars fastened in their sphere. But we see by observation that
this does not happen; and that the same stars always rise and set at the
 same places of the Earth (s. 1).</p>
<p>
Farthermore, the natural current both of the entire Earth and of each of
 its parts is towards the middle of the universe: this is the reason why
 it is at the centre, even though it happens to be actually there at
present (&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#947;&#8048;&#961;, &#954;&#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7984; &#964;&#965;&#947;&#967;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965; — he
 means that though actually there, it remains there not through any
force of inertia or other cause, but because it has a natural current
towards the centre). You might start a doubt, indeed, since the centre
of the Universe coincides with the centre of the Earth, to which of the
two it is that the current of heavy bodies naturally tends: whether they
 tend thereto because it is the centre of the Universe, or because it is
 the centre of the Earth. We must however necessarily suppose the
former; since Fire and light bodies, whose current is the contrary of
the current of heavy bodies, are carried to the extreme periphery of the
 Universe, or of that place which comprehends and surrounds the centre
of the Universe (ss. 2, 3). But it happens (&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#941;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#949;: it is an
accompanying fact) that the same point is centre of the Universe and
centre of the Earth; accordingly heavy bodies are carried by accident
(&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962; — by virtue of this accompanying fact) to the centre of
 the Earth; and the proof that they are carried to this same point is,
that their lines of direction are not parallel but according to similar
angles (s. 4). That the Earth therefore is at the centre, and that it is
 at rest, we may see by the foregoing reasons, as well as by the fact,
that stones thrown upwards to ever so great a height, are carried back
in the same line of direction to the same point (s. 5).</p>
<p>
We may see farther the cause why the Earth remains at rest. For, if its
natural current be from all directions towards the centre, as
observation shows, and that of Fire from the centre to the periphery, —
no portion of it can possibly be carried away from the centre, except by
 violence. For to one body belongs one current of motion, and to a
simple body a simple current — not the two opposite currents; and the
current <i>from</i> the centre is opposite to the current <i>to</i> the
centre. If, therefore, it be impossible for any portion of the Earth to
be carried in a direction away from the centre, it is yet more
impossible for the whole Earth to be so; for the natural current of each
 part is the same as that of the whole. Accordingly, since the Earth
cannot be moved except by a superior force or violence, it must
necessarily remain stationary at the centre (s. 6). The same conclusion
is confirmed by what we learn from geometers respecting astronomy; for
all the phenomena of the Heavens — the changes in figure, order, and
arrangement of the stars — take place as if the Earth were in the centre
 (s. 7).</p>
<p>
The figure of the Earth is necessarily spherical. For each of its parts
has gravity, until it reaches the centre; and the lesser part, pushed
forward by the greater, cannot escape laterally, but must become more
and more squeezed together, one part giving place to the other, until
the centre itself is reached. We must conceive what is here affirmed as
occurring in a manner like what some of the ancient physical
philosophers tell us, except that <i>they</i> ascribe the downward
current to an extraneous force; whereas we think it better to state the
truth, and to say that it occurs because <i>by nature</i> all heavy
bodies are carried towards the centre. Since, therefore, the preliminary
 Chaos or hotchpotch existed in power (or with its inherent powers
existing though not exercised), the elements (those which had gravity),
were carried from all sides equally towards the centre (&#7952;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#959;&#8022;&#957;
&#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#964;&#8048; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#7952;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056;
&#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; — this is an allusion to the doctrine of Anaxagoras); indeed,
whether brought together at the centre equally from all the periphery or
 in any other manner, the result will be the same. If we suppose
particles to be brought together at the centre equally from all sides,
it is plain that the mass so formed will be regular and spherical; and,
even if not equally from all sides, this will make no difference in the
reasoning; for, since all portions of the mass have weight or tend to
the centre, the larger portions will necessarily push the lesser before
them as far as the centre (ss. 8, 9).</p>
<p>
A difficulty here presents itself, which may be solved upon the same
principles. The Earth being spherical, and at the centre, suppose that a
 vast additional weight were applied to either of its hemispheres. In
that case, the centre of the Universe, and the centre of the Earth,
would cease to coincide: either, therefore, the Earth will not remain at
 the centre; or, if it would still remain at rest, while not occupying
the centre, it is in its nature to be moved even now (s. 10: &#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949; &#7970; &#959;&#8016;
&#956;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8150; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#965;, &#7970; &#949;&#7988;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7968;&#961;&#949;&#956;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#947;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945; &#8086;,
&#960;&#941;&#966;&#965;&#954;&#949; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#8166;&#957;) — <i>i.e.</i>, if the Earth <i>can</i> be at rest when not at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page653" id="page653"></a>653</span>centre,
 we must infer that the centre is not its natural place, and therefore
that its nature will be to be moved from the centre towards that natural
 place wherever situated).</p>
<p>
Such is a statement of the difficulty; but we shall see that it may be
cleared up with a little attention. We must distinguish what we mean
when we affirm that every particle having weight is carried towards the
centre. We clearly do not mean that it will be so carried until the
particles farthest from the centre shall touch the centre. We mean that
the greater mass must press with preponderating force (&#948;&#949;&#8150; &#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8056;
&#960;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#7957;&#969;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#955;&#940;&#946;&#8131; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#8179; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;) until its centre grasps the
centre of the universe; up to this point its gravity will last; and this
 is equally true about any clod of earth as about the whole earth: large
 or small size makes no difference. Whether the whole Earth were carried
 in a mass from any given position, or whether it were carried in
separate particles, in either case it would be carried onward until it
embraced the centre equally on all sides; the smaller parts being
equalized to the greater in gravitating tendency because they are pushed
 forward by the greater (&#7936;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#949;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8135;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#953; — s. 11). If, therefore, the Earth was ever generated, it must
have been generated in this manner, and must thus acquire a spherical
figure; and, even if it be ungenerable and stationary from everlasting,
we must conceive its figure to be that which it would have acquired, if
it had been generable and generated from the first (&#949;&#7988;&#964;&#949; &#7936;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#949;&#8054;
&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;, &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#8005;&#957;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#954;&#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7984; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;
&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;). That it must be spherical, we see not only from this
reasoning, but also because all heavy bodies are carried towards it, not
 in parallel lines but, in equal angles. This is what naturally happens
with what is either actually spherical, or by nature spherical. Now we
ought to call every thing such as it by nature wishes to become and to
be: we ought not to call it such as it is by force and contrary to
nature (s. 12).</p>
<p>
The same conclusion is established by the sensible facts within our
observation. If the Earth had been of any other than spherical figure,
the eclipses of the Moon would not have projected on the Sun the
outlines which we now see. The moon in her configurations throughout the
 month takes on every variety of outline — rectilinear, double convex,
and hollow. But in her eclipses the distinguishing line is always
convex. Now this must necessarily be occasioned by the circumference of
the Earth being spherical, since the eclipses of the Moon arise from the
 interposition of the Earth (s. 13).</p>
<p>
Farthermore, we see from the visible phenomena of the stars not only
that the Earth is spherical, but also that its magnitude is not great.
For, when we change our position a little as observers, either to the
north or to the south, we find the celestial horizon to be manifestly
different. The stars at the zenith are greatly changed, and the same
stars do not appear: some stars are visible in Egypt and Cyprus, but
become invisible when we proceed farther north; and those which are
constantly visible in the northern regions, are found to be not
constantly visible, but to set, when the observer is in Egypt or Cyprus.
 The bulk of the Earth must therefore be small, when a small change of
position is made so soon manifest to us (s. 14). Hence those who hold
that the regions near the pillars of Herakles join on with India and
that the ocean eastward and westward is one and the same, must not be
supposed to talk extravagantly (&#956;&#8052; &#955;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7940;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;):
they infer this from the presence of elephants alike at both
extremities. Geometers who try to calculate the magnitude of the Earth,
affirm that its circumference is 400,000 stadia.</p>
<p>
It follows necessarily from all these reasonings, that the body of the
Earth is not only of spherical form, but also not large compared with

[The remaining two books of the treatise known by the title ‘De Cœlo,’
while connected with the foregoing, are still more closely connected
with the two Books composing the treatise entitled ‘De Generatione et
Corruptione.’ The discussion carried on throughout the two treatises is
in truth one; but, if anywhere broken, it is at the end of Book II. De
Cœlo, as above. From this point Aristotle proceeds to consider (in four
Books) the particular phenomena presented by natural bodies — phenomena
of Generation and Destruction (in the widest sense of these words) —
dependent on the opposition of the upward and downward motions; bodies,
thus light or heavy, being thence seen to be ultimately reducible to
four elements variously combined. Treating of the Kosmos in its larger
aspects, the first two Books of De Cœlo, here abstracted, are obviously
those that alone correspond strictly to the name of the treatise.]</div>

<h2><span class="smcap">EPIKURUS</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our information from Epikurean writers respecting the doctrines of
their sect is much less copious than that which we possess from Stoic
writers in regard to Stoic opinions. We have no Epikurean writer on
philosophy except Lucretius; whereas respecting the Stoical creed under
the Roman Empire, the important writings of Seneca, Epictetus, and
Marcus Antoninus, afford most valuable evidence.</p>
<p>
The standard of Virtue and Vice is referred by Epikurus to Pleasure and
Pain. Pain is the only evil, Pleasure is the only good. Virtue is no end
 in itself, to be sought; vice is no end in itself, to be avoided. The
motive for cultivating virtue and banishing vice arises from the
consequences of each, as the means of multiplying pleasures and averting
 or lessening pains. But to the attainment of this purpose, the complete
 supremacy of Reason is indispensable; in order that we may take a right
 comparative measure of the varieties of pleasure and pain, and pursue
the course that promises the least amount of suffering.</p>
<p>
This theory (taken in its most general sense, and apart from differences
 in the estimation of particular pleasures and pains), had been
proclaimed long before the time of Epikurus. It is one of the various
theories of Plato; for in his dialogue called Protagoras (though in
other dialogues he reasons differently) we find it explicitly set forth
and elaborately vindicated by his principal spokesman, Sokrates, against
 the Sophist Protagoras. It was also held by Aristippus (companion of
Sokrates along with Plato) and by his followers after him, called the
Kyrenaics. Lastly, it was maintained by Eudoxus, one of the most
estimable philosophers contemporary with Aristotle. Epikurus was thus in
 no way the originator of the theory; but he had his own way of
conceiving it, his own body of doctrine physical, cosmological, and
theological, with which it was implicated, and his own comparative
valuation of pleasures and pains.</p>
<p>
Bodily feeling, in the Epikurean psychology, is prior in order of time
to the mental element; the former is primordial, while the latter is
derived from it by repeated processes of memory and association. But,
though such is the order of sequence and generation, yet when we compare
 the two as constituents of happiness to the formed man, the mental
element much outweighs the bodily, both as pain and as pleasure. Bodily
pain or pleasure exists only in the present; when not felt, it is
nothing. But mental feelings involve memory and hope, embrace the past
as well as the future, endure for a long time, and may be recalled or
put out of sight, to a great degree, at our discretion. </p>
<p>
This last point is one of the most remarkable features of the Epikurean
mental discipline. Epikurus deprecated the general habit of mankind in
always hankering after some new satisfaction to come; always
discontented with the present, and oblivious of past comforts as if they
 had never been. These past comforts ought to be treasured up by memory
and reflection, so that they might become as it were matter for
rumination, and might serve, in trying moments, even to counterbalance
extreme physical suffering. The health of Epikurus himself was very bad
during the closing years of his life. There remains a fragment of his
last letter, to an intimate friend and companion, Idomeneus:— “I write
this to you on the last day of my life, which, in spite of the severest
internal bodily pains, is still a happy day, because I set against them
in the balance all the mental pleasure felt in the recollection of my
past conversations with you. Take care of the children left by
Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of your demeanour from boyhood towards me
 and towards philosophy.” Bodily pain might thus be alleviated, when it
occurred; it might be greatly lessened in occurrence, by prudent and
moderate habits; lastly, even at the worst, if violent, it never lasted
long; if not violent, it might be patiently borne, and was at any rate
terminated, or terminable at pleasure, by death.</p>
<p>
In the view of Epikurus, the chief miseries of life arose, not from
bodily pains, but partly from delusions of hope and exaggerated
aspirations for wealth, honours, power, &amp;c., in all which the
objects appeared most seductive from a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page655" id="page655"></a>655</span>distance,
 inciting man to lawless violence and treachery, while in the reality
they were always disappointments and generally something worse; partly,
and still more, from the delusions of fear. Of this last sort, were the
two greatest torments of human existence — fear of Death and of eternal
suffering after death, as announced by prophets and poets, and fear of
the Gods. Epikurus, who did not believe in the continued existence of
the soul separate from the body, declared that there could never be any
rational ground for fearing death, since it was simply a permanent
extinction of consciousness. Death was nothing to us (he said): when
death comes, <i>we</i> are no more, either to suffer or to enjoy. Yet it
 was the groundless fear of this nothing that poisoned all the
tranquillity of life, and held men imprisoned even when existence was a
torment. Whoever had surmounted that fear was armed at once against
cruel tyranny and against all the gravest misfortunes. Next, the fear of
 the gods was not less delusive, and hardly less tormenting, than the
fear of death. It was a capital error (Epikurus declared) to suppose
that the gods employed themselves as agents in working or superintending
 the march of the Kosmos; or in conferring favour on some men, and
administering chastisement to others. The vulgar religious tales, which
represented them in this character, were untrue and insulting as regards
 the gods themselves, and pregnant with perversion and misery as regards
 the hopes and fears of mankind. Epikurus believed sincerely in the
gods; reverenced them as beings at once perfectly happy, immortal, and
unchangeable; and took delight in the public religious festivals and
ceremonies. But it was inconsistent with these attributes, and repulsive
 to his feelings of reverence, to conceive them as agents. The idea of
agency is derived from human experience: we, as agents, act with a view
to supply some want, to fulfil some obligation, to acquire some
pleasure, to accomplish some object desired but not yet attained — in
short, to fill up one or other of the many gaps in our imperfect
happiness: the gods already <i>have</i> all that agents strive to get,
and more than agents ever do get; their condition is one not of agency,
but of tranquil, self-sustaining, fruition. Accordingly, Epikurus
thought (as Aristotle<a name="FnAnchor19_1" href="#Footnote19_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 had thought before him) that the perfect, eternal, and imperturbable
well-being and felicity of the gods excluded the supposition of their
being agents. He looked upon them as types of that unmolested safety and
 unalloyed satisfaction which was what he understood by pleasure or
happiness, as objects of reverential envy, whose sympathy he was likely
to obtain by assimilating his own temper and condition to theirs as far
as human circumstances allowed.</p>

<p>
In the Ethica, Aristotle assigns theorizing contemplation to the gods,
as the only process worthy of their exalted dignity and supreme
felicity.</p></div>
<p>
These theological views were placed by Epikurus in the foreground of his ethical philosophy, as the only means of dispelling <span class="correction" title="amended from 'the fears of those gods'">those fears of the gods</span>
 that the current fables instilled into every one, and that did so much
to destroy human comfort and security. He proclaimed that beings in
immortal felicity neither suffered vexation in themselves nor caused
vexation to others; neither showed anger nor favour to particular
persons. The doctrine that they were the working managers in the affairs
 of the Kosmos, celestial and terrestrial, human and extra-human, he not
 only repudiated as incompatible with their attributes, but declared to
be impious, considering the disorder, sufferings, and violence,
everywhere visible. He disallowed all prophecy, divination, and oracular
 inspiration, by which the public around him believed that the gods were
 perpetually communicating special revelations to individuals, and for
which Sokrates had felt so peculiarly thankful.</p>
<p>
It is remarkable that Stoics and Epikureans, in spite of their marked
opposition in dogma or theory, agreed so far in practical results, that
both declared these two modes of uneasiness (fear of the gods and fear
of death) to be the great torments of human existence, and both strove
to remove or counterbalance them.</p>
<p>
So far the teaching of Epikurus appears confined to the separate
happiness of each individual, as dependent upon his own prudence,
sobriety, and correct views of Nature. But this is not the whole of the
Epikurean Ethics. The system also considered each man as in
companionship with others: the precepts were shaped accordingly, first
as to Justice, next as to Friendship. In both, these, the foundation
whereon Epikurus built was Reciprocity — not pure sacrifice to others,
but partnership with others, beneficial to all. He kept the ideas of
self and of others inseparably knit together in one complex <span class="pagenum"><a name="page656" id="page656"></a>656</span>association:
 he did not expel or degrade either, in order to give exclusive
ascendancy to the other. The dictate of Natural Justice was, that no man
 should hurt another: each was bound to abstain from doing harm to
others; each, on this condition, was entitled to count on security and
relief from the fear that others would do harm to him. Such double
aspect, or reciprocity, was essential to social companionship: those
that could not, or would not, accept this covenant, were unfit for
society. If a man does not behave justly towards others, he cannot
expect that they will behave justly towards him; to live a life of
injustice, and expect that others will not find it out, is idle. The
unjust man cannot enjoy a moment of security. Epikurus laid it down
explicitly, that just and righteous dealing was the indispensable
condition to every one’s comfort, and was the best means of attaining
it.</p>
<p>
The reciprocity of Justice was valid towards all the world; the
reciprocity of Friendship went much farther: it involved indefinite and
active beneficence, but could reach only to a select few. Epikurus
insisted emphatically on the value of friendship, as a means of
happiness to both the persons so united. He declared that a good friend
was another self, and that friends ought to be prepared, in case of
need, to die for each other. Yet he declined to recommend an established
 community of goods among the members of his fraternity, as prevailed in
 the Pythagorean brotherhood: for such an institution (he said) implied
mistrust. He recommended efforts to please and to serve, and a
forwardness to give, for the purpose of gaining and benefiting a friend,
 and he even declared that there was more pleasure in conferring favours
 than in receiving them; but he was no less strenuous in inculcating an
intelligent gratitude on the receiver. No one except a wise man (he
said) knew how to return a favour properly.<a name="FnAnchor19_2" href="#Footnote19_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote19_2" id="Footnote19_2"></a><a href="#FnAnchor19_2">2</a></span> Seneca, Epist. p. 81.</p></div>
<p>
These exhortations to active friendship were not unfruitful. We know,
even by the admission of witnesses adverse to the Epikurean doctrines,
that the harmony among the members of the sect, with common veneration
for the founder, was more marked and more enduring than that exhibited
by any of the other philosophical sects. Epikurus himself was a man of
amiable personal qualities: his testament, still remaining, shows an
affectionate regard both for his surviving friends, and for the
permanent attachment of each to the others as well as of all to the
school. Diogenes Laertius tells us — nearly 200 years after Christ, and
450 years after the death of Epikurus — that the Epikurean sect still
continued its numbers and dignity, having outlasted its contemporaries
and rivals. The harmony among the Epikureans may be explained, not
merely from the temper of the master, but partly from the doctrines and
plan of life that he recommended. Ambition and love of power were
discouraged; rivalry among the members for success, either political or
rhetorical, was at any rate a rare exception; all were taught to confine
 themselves to that privacy of life and love of philosophical communion
which alike required and nourished the mutual sympathies of the
brotherhood. In regard to politics, Epikurus advised quiet submission to
 established authority, without active meddling beyond what necessity
required.</p>
<p>
Virtue and happiness, in the theory of Epikurus, were inseparable. A man
 could not be happy until he had surmounted the fear of death and the
fear of gods instilled by the current fables, which disturbed all
tranquillity of mind; until he had banished those factitious desires
that pushed him into contention for wealth, power, or celebrity; nor
unless he behaved with justice to all, and with active devoted
friendship towards a few. Such a mental condition, which he thought it
was in every man’s power to acquire by appropriate teaching and
companionship, constituted virtue; and was the sure as well as the only
precursor of genuine happiness. A mind thus undisturbed and purified was
 sufficient to itself. The mere satisfaction of the wants of life, and
the conversation of friends, became then felt pleasures: if more could
be had without preponderant mischief, so much the better; but Nature,
disburthened of her corruptions and prejudices, required no more to be
happy. This at least was as much as the conditions of humanity admitted:
 a tranquil, undisturbed, innocuous, non-competitive fruition, which
approached most nearly to the perfect happiness of the Gods.</p>
<p>
When we read the explanations given by Epikurus and Lucretius of what
the Epikurean theory really was, and compare them with the numerous
attacks upon it made by opponents, we cannot but remark that the title
and formula of the theory was ill-chosen, and really a misnomer. What
Epikurus meant by Pleasure was not what most people meant by it, but
something very different — a tranquil and comfortable state of mind and
body; much the same as what Demokritus had expressed before him by the
phrase &#949;&#8016;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#943;&#945;. This last phrase would have expressed what Epikurus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page657" id="page657"></a>657</span>aimed
 at, neither more nor less. It would at least have preserved his theory
from much misplaced sarcasm and aggressive rhetoric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Physics of Epikurus was borrowed in the main from the atomic
theory of Demokritus, but modified by him in a manner subservient and
contributory to his ethical scheme. To that scheme it was essential that
 those celestial, atmospheric, or terrestrial phenomena which the public
 around him ascribed to agency and purposes of the gods, should be
understood as being produced by physical causes. An eclipse, an
earthquake, a storm, a shipwreck, unusual rain or drought, a good or a
bad harvest — and not merely these, but many other occurrences far
smaller and more unimportant, as we may see by the eighteenth chapter of
 the ‘Characters’ of Theophrastus — were then regarded as visitations of
 the gods, requiring to be interpreted by recognized prophets, and to be
 appeased by ceremonial expiations. When once a man became convinced
that all these phenomena proceeded from physical agencies, a host of
terrors and anxieties would disappear from the mind; and this Epikurus
asserted to be the beneficent effect and real recommendation of physical
 philosophy. He took little or no thought for scientific curiosity as a
motive <i>per se</i>, which both Demokritus and Aristotle put so much in the foreground.</p>
<p>
He composed a treatise called ‘Kanonicon’ (now lost), which seems to
have been a sort of Logic of Physics — a summary of the principles of
evidence. In his system, Psychology was to a great extent a branch —
though a peculiar and distinct branch — of Physics, since the soul was
regarded as a subtle but energetic material compound (air, vapour, heat,
 and another nameless ingredient), with its best parts concentrated in
the chest, yet pervading and sustaining the whole body — still, however,
 depending for its support on the body, and incapable of separate or
disembodied continuance. </p>
<p>
Epikurus recognized, as the primordial basis of the universe, Atoms, Vacuum, and Motion. The atoms were material solid <i>minima</i>,
 each too small to be apprehended separately by sense; they had figure,
magnitude, and gravity, but no other qualities. They were infinite in
number, and ever moving in an infinite vacuum. Their motions brought
them into various coalitions and compounds, resulting in the perceptible
 bodies of nature; each of which in its combined state acquired new,
specific, different qualities. In regard to the primordial movements of
the atoms, out of which these endowed compounds grew, Epikurus differed
from Demokritus who supposed the atoms originally to move with an
indefinite variety of directions and velocities, rotatory as well as
rectilineal; whereas Epikurus maintained that the only original movement
 common to all atoms was one and the same — in the direction of gravity
straight down, and all with equal velocity in the infinite void. But it
occurred to him that, upon this hypothesis only, there could never occur
 any collisions or combinations of the atoms — nothing but continued and
 unchangeable parallel lines. Accordingly he modified it by saying that
the line of descent was not strictly rectilinear, but that each atom
deflected a little from the straight line, each in its own direction and
 degree; so that it became possible to assume collisions, resiliences,
adhesions, combinations, among them, as it had been possible under the
variety of original movements ascribed to them by Demokritus. The
opponents of Epikurus derided this auxiliary hypothesis, affirming that
he invented the individual deflection of each atom without assigning any
 cause, and only because he was perplexed by the mystery of man’s
freewill. But Epikurus was not more open to attack on this ground than
other physical philosophers. Most of them (except perhaps the most
consistent of the Stoic fatalists) believed that some among the
phenomena of the universe occurred in regular and predictable sequence,
while others were essentially irregular and unpredictable: each
philosopher devised his hypothesis, and recognized some fundamental
principle, to explain the latter class of phenomena as well as the
former; thus, Plato admitted an invincible erratic necessity, Aristotle
introduced Chance and Spontaneity, Demokritus multiplied indefinitely
the varieties of atomic movements. The hypothetical deflection alleged
by Epikurus was his way, not more unwarranted than the others, of
providing a fundamental principle for the unpredictable phenomena of the
 universe. Among these are the volitional manifestations of men and
animals; but there are many others besides, and there is no ground for
believing that what is called the mystery of Free-Will (<i>i. e.</i>,
the question whether volition is governed by motives, acting upon a
given state of the mind and body) was at all peculiarly present to his
mind. Whatever theory may be adopted on this point, it is certain that
the movements of an individual man or animal are not exclusively
determined by the general law of gravitation, or by another cause
extrinsic to himself; but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page658" id="page658"></a>658</span>to
 a great degree by his own separate volition, which is often imperfectly
 knowable beforehand and therefore not predictable. For these and many
other phenomena, Epikurus provided a fundamental principle in his
supplementary hypothesis of atomic deflection; and indeed not for these
only, but also for the questions of opponents, how there could ever be
any coalition between the atoms, if all followed only one single law of
movement — rectilineal descent with equal velocity. Epikurus rejected
the inexorable and all-comprehensive fatalism contained in the theories
of some Stoics, though seemingly not construed in its full application
even by them. He admitted a limited range of empire to Chance, or
phenomena essentially irregular. But he maintained that the will, far
from being among the phenomena essentially irregular, is under the
influence of motives; for no man can insist more strenuously than he
does (see the letter to Menœkeus) on the complete power of philosophy —
if the student could be made to feel its necessity and desire the
attainment of it, so as to meditate and engrain within himself sound
views about the gods, death, and human life generally — to mould our
volitions and character in a manner conformable to the exigencies of
virtue and happiness.</p>
<p>
All true belief, according to Epikurus, rested ultimately upon the
impressions of sense, upon our internal feelings, and upon our correct
apprehension of the meaning of terms. He did not suppose the
significance of language to come by convention, but to be an inspiration
 of Nature, different among different people. The facts of sense were in
 themselves beyond all question. But truth, though founded upon these
evidences, included various inferences, more than sense could directly
testify. Even the two capital points of the Epikurean physical
philosophy — Atoms and Void — were inferences from sense, and not
capable of direct attestation. It was in these inferences, and in the
superstructure built upon sense, that error was so frequently imposed
upon us. We ought to test all affirmations or dogmas by the evidence of
sensible phenomena; looking therein, if possible, for some positive
grounds in support of them, but at any rate assuring ourselves that
there were no grounds in contradiction of them, or, if there were such,
rejecting the dogmas at once. Out of the particular impressions of
sense, when often repeated, remembered, and compared, there grew certain
 general notions or anticipations (&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#942;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;), which were applied to
interpret or illustrate any new case when it arose. These general
notions were not inborn or intuitive, but gradually formed (as Aristotle
 and the Stoics also conceived them) out of frequent remembrances and
association.</p>
<p>
Besides those conclusions which could be fully proved by the evidentiary
 data just enumerated, Epikurus recognized admissible hypotheses, which
awaited farther evidence confirmative or refutative (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;), and
also other matters occult or as yet unexplained (&#964;&#8048; &#7940;&#948;&#951;&#955;&#945;). Along with
the intermediate or half-explained class, he reckoned those in which
plurality of causes was to be invoked. A given effect might result from
any one out of two, three, or more different causes, and there was often
 no counter-evidence of sense to exclude either of them in any
particular case. This plural explanation (&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962;) was not so
complete or satisfactory as the singular (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962;); but it was often
the best that we could obtain, and was quite sufficient, by showing a
possible physical agency, to rescue the mind from those terrors of
ignorance, which drove men to imagine visitations of the gods. </p>
<p>
Epikurus agreed with Demokritus in believing that external objects
produced their impressions on our senses by projecting thin images,
outlines of their own shapes. He thought that the air was peopled with
such images, which passed through it and still more through the infinite
 vacuum beyond it with prodigious velocity. Many of them became
commingled, dissipated, recombined, during the transit, so that, when
they reached us, the impressions produced were not conformable to any
real object; hence the phenomena of dreams, madness, and the various
delusions of waking men.</p>
<p>
In setting forth the criterion of truth, Epikurus insisted chiefly upon
the fundamental groundwork — particular facts of sense, as the data for
proving or disproving general affirmations; and he had the merit of
calling attention to refutative data as well as to probative. But,
respecting the process of passing from these particulars to true
generalities and avoiding the untrue, we can make out no clear idea from
 his writings that remain: his great work on Physical Philosophy is
lost. It is certain that he disregarded the logical part of the process —
 the systematic study of propositions, and their relations of
consistency with one another — which had made so prodigious a stride
during his early years under Aristotle and Theophrastus. We can, indeed,
 detect in his remaining sentences one or two of those terms which
Aristotle had stamped as technical in Logic; but he discouraged as
useless all the verbal teaching and discussion of his day — all grammar,
 rhetoric, and dialectic, beyond the lowest minimum. He disapproved of
the poets as promulgators of mischievous fables and prejudices, the
rhetoricians as furnishing weapons for the misleading career of
political ambition, the dialecticians as wasting their time in useless
puzzles. None of them were serviceable in promoting either the
tranquillity of the mind, or the happiness of life, or the acquisition
of truth. He himself composed a great number of treatises and epistles,
on subjects of ethics and philosophy; but he is said to have written in
haste, without taking time or trouble to correct his compositions. By
the Alexandrine critic, Aristophanes of Byzantium, his style was
censured as unpolished; yet it is declared to have been simple,
unaffected, and easily understood. This last predicate is hardly
applicable to the three epistles which alone remain from his pen; but
those epistles are intended as brief abstracts of doctrine, on topics
which he had already treated at length in formal works; and it is not
easy to combine clearness with brevity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="smcap">THE STOICS — A FRAGMENT.</span></h2>

<p>
The Stoics were one of the four sects of philosophy recognized and
conspicuous at Athens during the three centuries preceding the Christian
 era and during the century or more following. Among these four sects,
the most marked antithesis of ethical dogma was between the Stoics and
the Epikureans.</p>
<p>
The Stoics agreed with the Peripatetics (anterior to Epikurus, not specially against <i>him</i>)
 that the first principle of nature is (not pleasure or relief from
pain, but) Self-preservation or Self-love; in other words, the natural
appetite or tendency of all creatures is, to preserve their existing
condition with its inherent capacities, and to keep clear of destruction
 or disablement. This appetite (they said) manifests itself in little
children before any pleasure or pain is felt, and is moreover a
fundamental postulate, pre-supposed in all desires of particular
pleasures, as well as in all aversions to particular pains. We begin by
loving our own vitality; and we come, by association, to love what
promotes or strengthens our vitality; we hate destruction or
disablement, and come (by secondary association) to hate whatever
produces that effect.</p>
<p>
This doctrine associated, and brought under one view, what was common to
 man not merely with the animal, but also with the vegetable world; a
plant was declared to have an impulse or tendency to maintain itself,
without feeling pain or pleasure. Aristotle (in the tenth Book of the
Ethica) says that he will not determine whether we love life for the
sake of pleasure, or pleasure for the sake of life; for he affirms the
two to be essentially yoked together and inseparable: pleasure is the
consummation of our vital manifestations. The Peripatetics, after him,
put pleasure down to a lower level, as derivative and accidental. The
Stoics went farther in the same direction — possibly from antithesis
against the growing school of Epikurus.</p>
<p>
The primary <i>officium</i> (in a larger sense than our word duty) of man is (they said) to keep himself in the State of Nature; the second or derivative <i>officium</i>
 is to keep to such things as are according to nature, and to avert
those that are contrary to nature; our gradually increasing experience
enables as to discriminate the two. The youth learns, as he grows up, to
 value bodily accomplishments, mental cognitions and judgments, good
conduct towards those around him, — as powerful aids towards keeping up
that state of nature. When his experience is so far enlarged as to make
him aware of the order and harmony of nature and human society, and to
impress upon him the comprehension of this great <i>idéal</i>, his
emotions as well as his reason becomes absorbed by it. He recognizes
this as the only true Bonum or Honestum, to which all other desirable
things are referable; as the only thing desirable for itself and in its
own nature. He drops or dismisses all these <i>prima naturæ</i> that he had begun by desiring. He no longer considers any of them as worthy of being desired in itself, or for its own sake.</p>
<p>
While, therefore, (according to Peripatetics as well as Stoics) the love
 of self and of preserving one’s own vitality and activity is the
primary element, intuitive and connate, to which all rational preference
 (<i>officium</i>) was at first referred, they thought it not the less
true that in process of time, by experience, association, and
reflection, there grows up in the mind a grand acquired sentiment or
notion, a new and later light, which extinguishes and puts out of sight
the early beginning. It was important to distinguish the feeble and
obscure elements from the powerful and brilliant after-growth; which
indeed was fully realized only in chosen minds, and in them hardly
before old age. This idea, when once formed in the mind, was The Good —
the only thing worthy of desire for its own sake. The Stoics called it
the only good, being sufficient in itself for happiness; other things
being not good, nor necessary to happiness, but simply preferable or
advantageous when they could be had: the Peripatetics recognized it as
the first and greatest good, but said also that it was not sufficient in
 itself; there were two other inferior varieties of good, of which
something must be had as complementary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page661" id="page661"></a>661</span>(what the Stoics called <i>præposita</i> or <i>sumenda</i>).<a name="FnAnchor20_1" href="#Footnote20_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
 Thus the Stoics said about the origin of the Idea of Bonum or Honestum,
 much the same as what Aristotle says about ethical Virtue. It is not
implanted in us by nature; but we have at birth certain initial
tendencies and capacities, which, if aided by association and training,
enable us (and that not in all cases) to acquire it.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote20_1" id="Footnote20_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchor20_1">1</a></span> Aristotle and the Peripatetics held that there were <i>tria genera bonorum</i>: (1) Those of the mind (<i>mens sana</i>);
 (2) Those of the body; and (3) External advantages. The Stoics altered
this theory by saying that only the first of the three was <i>bonum</i>; the others were merely <i>præposita</i> or <i>sumenda</i>. The opponents of the Stoics contended that this was an alteration in words rather than in substance.</p>
<p>
The earlier Stoics laid it down that there were no graduating marks
below the level of wisdom: all shortcomings were on a par. Good was a
point, Evil was a point; there were gradations in the <i>præposita</i> or <i>sumenda</i> (none of which were good), and in the <i>rejecta</i> or <i>rejicienda</i> (none of which were evil), but there was no more or less good.</p></div>
<p>
A distinction was made by Epictetus and other Stoics between things in
our power and things not in our power. In our power are our opinions and
 notions about objects, and all our affections, desires, and aversions:
not in our power are our bodies, wealth, honour, rank, authority,
&amp;c., and their opposites; though, in regard to these last, it is in
our power to <i>think</i> of them as unimportant. With this distinction
we may connect the arguments between the Stoics and their opponents as
to what is now called the Freedom of the Will. But we must first begin
by distinguishing the two questions. By things in our power, the Stoics
meant things that we could do or acquire if we willed: by things not in
our power, they meant things that we could not do or acquire if we
willed. In both cases, the volition was assumed as a fact: the question
what determined it, or whether it was non-determined, <i>i. e.</i>,
self-determining, was not raised in the antithesis. But it was raised in
 other discussions between the Stoic theorist Chrysippus, and various
opponents. These opponents denied that volition was determined by
motives, and cited the cases of equal conflicting motives (what is known
 as the Ass of Buridan) as proving that the soul includes in itself, and
 exerts, a special supervenient power of deciding action in one way or
the other — a power not determined by any causal antecedent, but
self-originating, and belonging to the class of agency that Aristotle
recognizes under the denomination of automatic, spontaneous (or
essentially irregular and unpredictable). Chrysippus replied by denying
not only the reality of this supervenient force said to be inherent in
the soul, but also the reality of all that Aristotle called automatic or
 spontaneous agency generally. Chrysippus said that every movement was
determined by antecedent motives; that in cases of equal conflict the
exact equality did not long continue, because some new but slight motive
 slipped in unperceived and turned the scale on one side or the other.<a name="FnAnchor20_2" href="#Footnote20_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
 Here, we see, the question now known as the Freedom of the Will is
discussed, and Chrysippus declares against freedom, affirming that
volition is always determined by motives.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote20_2" id="Footnote20_2"></a><a href="#FnAnchor20_2">2</a></span> See Plutarch, De Stoicorum Repugnantiis, xxiii. p. 1045.</p></div>
<p>
But we also see that, while declaring this opinion, Chrysippus does not
employ the terms Necessity or Freedom of the Will; neither did his
opponents, so far as we can see: they had a different and less
misleading phrase. By freedom, Chrysippus and the Stoics meant the
freedom of doing what a man willed, if he willed it. A man is free as to
 the thing that is in his power, when he wills it: he is not free as to
what is not in his power, under the same supposition. The Stoics laid
great stress on this distinction. They pointed out how much it is really
 in a man’s power to transform or discipline his own mind — in the way
of controlling or suppressing some emotions, generating or encouraging
others, forming new intellectual associations, &amp;c.; how much a man
could do in these ways, if he willed it, and if he went through the
lessons, habits of conduct, and <span class="correction" title="amended from 'medita-tations'">meditations</span>,
 suitable to produce such an effect. The Stoics strove to create in a
man’s mind the volitions appropriate for such mental discipline, by
depicting the beneficial consequences resulting from it, and the
misfortune and shame inevitable, if the mind were not so disciplined.
Their purpose was to strengthen the governing reason of his mind, and to
 enthrone it as a fixed habit and character, which would control by
counter suggestions the impulse arising at each special moment —
particularly all disturbing terrors or allurements. This, in their view,
 is a free mind; not one wherein volition is independent of all motive,
but one wherein the susceptibility to different motives is tempered by
an ascendant reason, so as to give predominance to the better motive
against the worse. One of the strongest motives that they endeavoured to
 enforce, was the prudence and dignity of bringing our volitions into
harmony with the schemes of Providence; which (they said) were always
arranged with a view to the happiness of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page662" id="page662"></a>662</span>the
 Kosmos on the whole. The bad man, whose volitions conflict with these
schemes, is always baulked of his expectations, and brought at last
against his will to see things carried by an over-ruling force, with
aggravated pain and humiliation to himself: while the good man, who
resigns himself to them from the first, always escapes with less pain,
and often without any at all. As a portion of their view concerning
Providence it may here be mentioned that the earlier Stoics, Zeno and
Chrysippus, entertained high reverence for the divination, prophecy, and
 omens that were generally current in the ancient world. They considered
 that these were the methods whereby the gods were graciously pleased to
 make known beforehand revelations of their foreordained purposes.
Herein lay one among the marked points of contrast between Stoics and
Epikureans.</p>
<p>
We have thus seen that in regard to the doctrine called in modern times the Freedom of the Will (<i>i.e.</i>,
 that volitions are self-originating and unpredictable), the Stoic
theorists not only denied it, but framed all their Ethics upon the
assumption of the contrary. This same assumption of the contrary,
indeed, was made also by Sokrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Epikurus; in
short, by all the ethical teachers of antiquity. All of them believed
that volitions depended on causes; that, under the ordinary conditions
of men’s minds, the causes that volitions generally depended upon are
often misleading and sometimes ruinous; but that, by proper stimulation
from without and meditation within, the rational causes of volition
might be made to overrule the impulsive. Plato, Aristotle, Epikurus, not
 less than the Stoics, wished to create new fixed habits and a new type
of character. They differed, indeed, on the question what the proper
type of character was; but each of them aimed at the same general end — a
 new type of character, regulating the grades of susceptibility to
different motives. And the purpose of all and each of these moralists
precludes the theory of free-will, <i>i.e.</i>, the theory that our volitions are self-originating and unpredictable.</p>
<p>
While the Epikureans declined, as much as possible, interference in
public affairs, the Stoic philosophers urged men to the duties of active
 citizenship.<a name="FnAnchor20_3" href="#Footnote20_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
 Chrysippus even said that the life of philosophical contemplation (such
 as Aristotle preferred and accounted godlike) was to be placed on the
same level with the life of pleasure; though Plutarch observes that
neither Chrysippus nor Zeno ever meddled personally with any public
duty: both of them passed their lives in lecturing and writing. The
truth is that both of them were foreigners residing at Athens, and at a
time when Athens was dependent on foreign princes. Accordingly, neither
Zeno nor Chrysippus had any sphere of political action open to them:
they were, in this respect, like Epictetus afterwards, but in a position
 quite different from Seneca, the preceptor of Nero, who might hope to
influence the great imperial power of Rome, and from Marcus Antoninus,
who held that imperial power in his own hands.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnote20_3" id="Footnote20_3"></a><a href="#FnAnchor20_3">3</a></span> Tacitus says of the Stoics (Ann. xiv. 57): ‘Stoicorum secta, quæ turbidos et negotiorum appetentes facit.’</p></div>
<p>
Marcus Antoninus — not only a powerful emperor, but also the most gentle
 and amiable man of his day — talks of active beneficence both as a duty
 and a satisfaction. But in the creed of the Stoics generally, active
beneficence did not occupy a prominent place. They adopted the four
Cardinal Virtues — Wisdom, or the Knowledge of Good and Evil, Justice,
Fortitude, Temperance — as part of their plan of the virtuous life, the
life according to Nature. Justice, as the social virtue, was placed
above all the rest. But the Stoics were not strenuous in requiring more
than Justice, for the benefit of others beside the agent. They even
reckoned compassion for the sufferings of others as a weakness,
analogous to envy for the good fortune of others.</p>
<p>
The Stoic recognised the gods (or Universal Nature, equivalent
expressions in his creed) as managing the affairs of the world, with a
view to producing as much happiness as was attainable on the whole.
Towards this end the gods did not want any positive assistance from him;
 but it was his duty and his strongest interest, to resign himself to
their plans, and to abstain from all conduct tending to frustrate them.
Such refractory tendencies were perpetually suggested to him by the
unreasonable appetites, emotions, fears, antipathies, &amp;c., of daily
life; all claiming satisfaction at the expense of future mischief to
himself and others. To countervail these misleading forces by means of a
 fixed rational character built up through meditation and philosophical
teaching, was the grand purpose of the Stoic ethical creed. The
emotional or appetitive self was to be starved or curbed, and retained
only as an appendage to the rational self; an idea proclaimed before in
general terms by Plato, but carried out into a system by the Stoics,
though to a great extent also by the Epikureans.</p>
<p>
The Stoic was taught to reflect how <span class="pagenum"><a name="page663" id="page663"></a>663</span>much
 that appears to be desirable, terror-striking, provocative, &amp;c., is
 not really so, but is made to appear so by false and curable
associations. And, while he thus discouraged those self-regarding
emotions that placed him in hostility with others, he learnt to respect
the self of another man as well as his own. Epictetus advises to deal
mildly with a man that hurts us either by word or deed; and advises it
upon the following very remarkable ground:— “Recollect that in what he
says or does, he follows his own sense of propriety, not yours. He must
do what appears to him right, not what appears to you: if he judges
wrongly, it is he that is hurt, for he is the person deceived. Always
repeat to yourself, in such a case: The man has acted on his own
opinion.”</p>
<p>
The reason here given by Epictetus is an instance, memorable in ethical
theory, of respect for individual dissenting conviction, even in an
extreme case; and it must be taken in conjunction with his other
doctrine, that damage thus done to us unjustly is really little or no
damage, except so far as we ourselves give pungency to it by our
irrational susceptibilities and associations. We see that the Stoic
submerges, as much as he can, the pre-eminence of his own individual
self, and contemplates himself from the point of view of another, as
only one among many. But he does not erect the happiness of others into a
 direct object of his own positive pursuit, beyond the reciprocities of
family, citizenship, and common humanity. The Stoic theorists agreed
with Epikurus in inculcating the reciprocities of Justice between all
fellow-citizens; and they even went farther than he did, by extending
the sphere of such duties beyond the limits of city, so as to comprehend
 all mankind. But as to the reciprocities of individual Friendship,
Epikurus went beyond the Stoics in the amount of self-sacrifice and
devotion that he enjoined for the benefit of a friend.</p>
